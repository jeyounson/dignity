Julie Copley

Abstract The idea of human dignity is widely relied on in modern constitutional systems, yet in legal and political theory it is the focus of significant contention. Jeremy Waldron's engagement, since 1999 when The Dignity of Legislation and Law and Disagreement were published, with the democratic and constitutional practice and with the theoretical argument constitutes a rich source of legal, political and social analysis of human dignity. Waldron's own literature demonstrates that, as an "essentially contested concept", we ask questions about human dignity as a way of pinning it down. When public authority is exercised to make legislation, the invaluable, aggregated and illuminating work of Waldron across this period demonstrates the concept of human dignity to be indispensable—empowering as well as constraining exercises of legislative authority.

Human dignity is invoked explicitly in the constitutions of many modern states, and Jeremy Waldron argues that the value of equal freedom for all is invoked implicitly in the structures and rights of a modern constitutional state when there is a constitution governing—for the people—exercises of public authority. Relevant to the idea of legislation, Waldron's lengthy democratic jurisprudence encompasses an initial conceptualisation of procedural and citizenship dignity, then subsequently particularised as a status-concept, a juridical concept, and as a pervasive constitutional value "marking out the point of the whole enterprise" (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), p. 19). This essay follows that progressive particularisation of human dignity, examining the concept and its functionality in a modern constitutional state. As an "essentially contested concept", human dignity manages and resolves difference within a pluralistic political community, proving capable of combatting undemocratic and internally-divisive threats to modern constitutional states.

### 1 Legislative Virtues

Waldron says use of a concept such as 'human dignity' requires the user to explain its content—what dignity requires, is based on, and why dignity is the same for all human persons. Explanation is necessary too of the range of application of the term, and Waldron refers to human dignity as doing two jobs. Vertically, dignity identifies "a particular value or set of requirements that attend our dealings with each human person", and horizontally, dignity "asserts an equality of that value or a sameness of those requirements across all human persons" (Waldron [2017](#page-253-0), p. 3). The concept of human dignity, and the vertical and horizontal application of human dignity in a modern constitutional state has been analysed by Waldron as relevant to exercises of legislative power. Accordingly, "the dignity of legislation" constitutes a productive perspective from which to examine Waldron's lengthy engagement with an early conception and a developing concept of human dignity.

In the publications of Law and Disagreement (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0)) and its complement, The Dignity of Legislation (Waldron [1999a](#page-252-0)), Waldron's analysis is of legislation and its virtues. The conceptualisation of dignity occurs within a study of "statutes and the institutions that enact them" (Waldron [1999a](#page-252-0), p. 9). Waldron's aspiration is to a process of making legislation seen "at its best" as something involving community representatives coming together "to settle solemnly and explicitly on common schemes and measures that can stand in the name of them all" and for them to do so "in a way that openly acknowledges and respects (rather than conceals) the inevitable differences of opinion and principle among them." For the idea of legislation is not the same as the idea of law (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 128). Lawmaking is "any activity that has the effect of making or changing the laws", but lawgiving is "the business of making or changing law explicitly, in an institution and through a process publicly dedicated to that task" (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), pp. 28–29). The idea of legislation then "embodies a commitment to explicit lawmaking, a principled commitment to the idea that on the whole it is good, if law is to be made or changed, that it should be made or changed in a process publicly dedicated to that task" (Waldron [2012c](#page-252-0), pp. 106–107; Weinrib [2016](#page-253-0), p. 52).

The representative exercise of legislative authority is one of the hallmarks of a modern constitutional state and parliaments and their procedures are remarkably similar around the world. Waldron observes that the similarities arise from a common human response to similar problems; that is, a political community's felt need for a set of enduring rules and procedures that constitute a public space. Hannah Arendt describes a "stable worldly structure to house their combined power of action" (Waldron [2016](#page-252-0), p. 273). Thus, "the legislature occupies a pre-eminent role in most legal systems, largely due to the fact that it is an institution set up explicitly – dedicated explicitly – to the making and changing of the law stated" (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), p. 76). The common foundations across modern constitutional states are that: the political community for which law is given is essentially plural (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), p. 60); legislation must stand in the name of all in the community; and it must stand for all "even in the circumstances of controversy over the substantive values that it embodies" (Waldron [1996,](#page-252-0) pp. 1537–1538; Arendt [1963,](#page-251-0) p. 208).

Together, Law and Disagreement and The Dignity of Legislation are to "recover and highlight ways of thinking about legislation that present it as a dignified mode of governance and a respectable source of law" in order to make "a healthy difference ... to our overall concept of law" (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) pp. 2–3; Waldron [1999b,](#page-252-0) p. viii). Waldron does not deny the disrepute of legislatures and legislators, but suggests we follow the advice of Machiavelli to look past the tumults of the legislature for the good effects engendered by disagreements. One reason to do so is to address a problem—that "we are not in possession of a jurisprudential model that is capable of making normative sense of legislation as a genuine form of law, of the authority it claims, and of the demands that it makes on the other actors in a legal system" (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) pp. 1–2, 35). Other reasons are to overcome: disinterest and distrust on the part of orthodox legal theorists such as Ronald Dworkin and HLA Hart; scholarly trivialisation of the legislative process confining it to "interstitial issues of policy" having "no compelling moral dimension"; and scholarly inattention to the structure and institutional details of legislatures (Posner [2000,](#page-252-0) p. 583).

Legislation's norms have long been part of Western jurisprudence, particularly positivist jurisprudence and, in The Dignity of Legislation, Waldron examines "the resources we have in our tradition of political thought for sustaining and elaborating" thought about legislation and which present its good effects (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) pp. 2–3, 39). In the work of Immanuel Kant, John Locke and Aristotle, Waldron finds a lengthy tradition of thought about a philosophically overlooked form of lawgiving. Each has something to say about themes connected with legislation as it responds to "the primal need to extrapolate some decision-procedure from the very notion of a political society" (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) pp. 3, 164). The result of that decision-procedure (legislation) is not, Waldron says, the same as issuing a decree (Waldron [2012c,](#page-252-0) p. 107):

... it is a formally defined act consisting of a laborious process. In a well-structured legislature, that process involves public consultation and the commissioning of reports and consultative papers; as well as the informal stages of public debate, it includes also successive stages of formal deliberation in the legislature, deliberation and voting in institutional settings where the legislative proposal is subject to scrutiny at the hands of myriad representatives of various social interests.

We insist on the formal elements and a laborious process "because of the way they enable law to respect human dignity". Waldron declares it essential to law that it be susceptible to deliberate change, given the legislature is set up to explicitly make and change law, publicly and transparently (Waldron [2012c](#page-252-0), pp. 50, 95). Thus, "it matters ... not only that the laws come from the right source, but that they come from the right source in the right way" (Waldron [2008,](#page-252-0) p. 24). And respect for human dignity in the legislative process is consistent, Waldron argues, with the accounts of Lon Fuller and Joseph Raz. For those theorists, and for many, he says the enactment of a properly drafted statute "is precisely the sort of activity to which (for example) Lon Fuller's famous eight principles of ... the inner morality of law" are properly directed (Waldron [2012c,](#page-252-0) p. 82):

Generality, clarity, constancy, publicity, prospectivity, and practicability – these are in fact all best understood as virtues of legislation. Indeed, Fuller's presentation of those principles in his The Morality of Law was precisely as a discipline incumbent on a legislator, Fuller's rather hapless character, King Rex.

Further, the legislative process demands respect for human dignity because disagreement about matters of principle is the rule, not the exception, in politics (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), p. 15). Aristotle holds that "[i]t is possible to argue ... that in the making of law the collective wisdom of a people is superior to that of even the wisest lawgiver" (Waldron [1999a](#page-252-0), p. 108). Thus, legislatures are a common, human response also to the need for joint action where there is disagreement (Arendt [1963](#page-251-0), pp. 175, 208): transparent and systemic lawgiving adopted as "the democratic solution to the problem posed by the fact that in a complex, heterogeneous society people do not agree on ends" (Posner [2001](#page-252-0), p. 19). And disagreements are complex in a modern democratic community in which legislative authority is exercised on behalf of the aggregate of its electors who are not passive subjects of laws made by another, but "active citizens who contribute to the creation of the laws by which they are bound" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 54). Bentham recognised therefore that proposed legislative measures must involve a "back and forth ... between the prejudices of the people and the fallacies of their representatives" (Bentham [1931,](#page-251-0) pp. 77–78; Waldron [2016,](#page-252-0) p. 146).

Waldron's conceptualisation of dignity in Law and Disagreement and The Dignity of Legislation may be seen on the one hand as a political arrangement and a legislative institution having a dignity, and on the other as a requirement that each private person within a political community for which laws are given be treated with dignity and have his or her human dignity respected. Regarding the former, Waldron describes an elected legislator as, "the individual person as essentially a thinking agent, endowed with an ability to deliberate morally and to transcend a preoccupation with his own particular or sectional interests" (Waldron [1999b,](#page-252-0) p. 222). Regarding the latter, Waldron insists we are all equal in the authorisation of political action, because consistent with Gregory Vlastos's idea of "a single status society", modern democracies are organised as societies in which all are of equal high rank (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 160; Vlastos [1984,](#page-252-0) p. 54). Each must be seen as having equal voice authorizing and constraining exercises of legislative authority. And, as Raz states, respect for human dignity requires treatment of humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future (Raz [1979,](#page-252-0) p. 124; Waldron [2012c,](#page-252-0) p. 52).

Dignity in this latter sense is encapsulated for Law and Disagreement in the monograph's "motto" taken from Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan and deeming it "intolerable in the society of men" for each private person within a political community to demand their sense of right be treated as the one that is to prevail (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 12). And for The Dignity of Legislation, the sense of the dignity of private persons in a modern constitutional state is encapsulated in a paragraph from John Stuart Mill's Considerations on Representative Government (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), pp. 160–161; Mill [1861,](#page-252-0) pp. 329, 335):1

... it is a personal injustice to withhold from anyone ... the ordinary privilege of having his voice reckoned in the disposal of affairs in which he has the same interest as other people. If he is compelled to pay, if he may be compelled to fight, if he is required implicitly to obey, he should be legally entitled to be told what for; to have his consent asked, and his opinion counted at its worth... . Every one is degraded ... when other people ... take upon themselves unlimited power to regulate his destiny... . Every one has a right to feel insulted by being made a nobody, and stamped as of no account.

Each motto is relevant also to human dignity as a citizenship-related status-idea, analysed by Waldron in the two 1999 publications and maintained in subsequent publications. This first particularisation by Waldron of dignity—as a statusconcept—is an enduring feature of his arguments about dignity. It is examined in Sect. 2.

### 2 A Status-Concept

Human dignity can be approached as a status-concept, Waldron suggests, and as such it draws attention to the rights, duties, powers and immunities attaching to a private person, and is a foundational element for different rights and norms. A statusconcept makes sense of the rights and norms being gathered together for an underlying reason and Waldron suggests that in the case of human dignity, the underlying reason relates to "the special and momentous significance of the individual human person" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 8).

Regarding exercises of legislative authority in a modern constitutional state, Waldron's literature consistently draws attention to the moment of citizenship dignity in a modern constitutional state. In The Dignity of Legislation, Waldron commences a chapter about "Kant's positivism" by stating there are many of us in a political community, and we disagree about justice. Waldron's chapter finds Kant insistent that we "take account of the fact that there are others in the world besides ourselves" and see others "not just as objects of moral concern or respect, but as other minds, other intellects, other agents of moral thought, coordinate and competitive with our own." In urging adoption of Machiavelli's conception of politics, the suggestion is that we ought as Kant said, "proceed with [others in the community] into a rightful condition"; that is, into civil society governed by legislation, and that we should accept the reality of social strife as a fact of life, the circumstance of politics. There will be "several conceptions of justice and rights" in a political community and, if each is militantly upheld, it is difficult to put universal and equal dignity to work in law (Waldron [1999a](#page-252-0), pp. 35, 56–57).

<sup>1</sup> Waldron notes Mill did not extend his conception of human dignity to all private persons equally.

Lawgiving is designed "to enable us to act in the face of disagreement" (Waldron [2016](#page-252-0), p. 294). A sense of the legislative limits for a modern constitutional state is to be located in the political culture. There is likely to be disagreement and contestation among the people as to what the legislative limits are. Yet, acting as a body, the people are "capable of making better decisions, by pooling their knowledge, experience, and insight, than any individual member of the body, however excellent, is capable of making on his own" (Waldron [1999a](#page-252-0), pp. 84, 93–94). In The Dignity of Legislation, Waldron notes that these principles do not assume a cool consensus existing only as an ideal. Nor are they abstract theoretical considerations (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 155):

In the United States, in Western Europe, and in all other democracies, every single step that has been taken by legislatures towards making society safer, more civilized, and more just has been taken against a background of disagreement, but taken nonetheless in a way that managed somehow to retain the loyalty and compliance (albeit often grudging loyalty and compliance) of those who in good faith opposed the measures in question.

Indeed, Waldron has lived experience of the good effects of landmark social reforms effected by citizens demanding legislation according with shared values within a political community. His early years were in New Zealand, regarded around the turn of the twentieth century (prior to Waldron's birth) as the social laboratory of the world (Siegfried [1914;](#page-252-0) Webb [1959)](#page-253-0).2 With the enactment of the Electoral Act 1893 (NZ), for example, New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to include women in the electoral franchise. Robert Stout, one of the earliest enrolments (in 1871) at the University of Otago where Waldron later spent his undergraduate years, became its first law lecturer, New Zealand's Attorney-General, Premier (Prime Minister) and Chief Justice, KCMG and privy counsellor. Stout and Lady Anna Paterson Stout were key proponents of women's suffrage and primarily responsible for initiating legislative reform in New Zealand qualifying testamentary freedom to ensure maintenance of dependent family members from an estate (Atherton [1990](#page-251-0)).3 It should not surprise then when Waldron says that although voting in democratic elections may seem mundane and "although it is shared with millions of others, this vote is not a little thing". Rather, it should be understood "in a more momentous way, as the entitlement of each person, as part of his or her dignity as an (equal) peer of the realm, to be consulted in public affairs" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) p. 36).

<sup>2</sup> Posner states that "Jeremy Waldron, law professor and political philosopher, is a New Zealander educated there and in England, and, although he has lived and worked in this country for many years, he brings to the study of American constitutional theory the valuable perspective of an outsider. He sees things that we natives overlook even though they are right before our eyes" (Posner [2000,](#page-252-0) p. 582). And Allan and Geddis note that Waldron has been described as "one of New Zealand's most distinguished sons" (Allan and Geddis [2006,](#page-251-0) p. 94).

<sup>3</sup> The Dictionary of New Zealand Biography, Te Ara, states: "Stout had a sound knowledge of most of the major political theorists of the day. On occasions he spoke in the House with the works of John Stuart Mill piled 'three feet high' in front of him" (see [https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2s4](https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2s48/stout-robert) [8/stout-robert](https://teara.govt.nz/en/biographies/2s48/stout-robert)).

While the dignity of citizenship and human dignity are not the same, Waldron suggests there are both resonations beyond the confines of Kant's philosophy, and implications for the way we think about human dignity in the modern world. Like Kant, Waldron assumes citizenship to be a status, and "when citizenship is taken to be an important status that, in one state or another, should be available to everyone, then what it amounts to may be a good guide to the way in which human dignity can be realized in a world of separate states." Dignity too is best understood as a statusterm, in Waldron's view, and it is usually associated with a status that is valued and respected (Waldron [2013a,](#page-252-0) p. 333). However, the dignity of citizenship involves "layers of respect beneath whatever democratic arrangements might exist for voting and other forms of political participation." It is, Waldron argues, "the dignity of being one of those for whose sake the legal and political structures exist and by whose agency – along with that of millions of others – those structures are sustained" (Waldron [2013a](#page-252-0), p. 340).

Waldron's argument about dignity as a status-concept engages with and withstands the arguments of other theorists. Christopher McCrudden observes that, in talking of the dignity of the citizen so as to bridge the gap between an egalitarian idea of human dignity and dignity as status, Waldron argues for a modern understanding of dignity that takes "the intuition that dignity is about status" and combines it with "modern commitments to equality" (McCrudden [2013](#page-252-0), p. 42). According to this understanding, the general quality of a relationship between the rulers and the ruled in a modern constitutional state may be determined from an extension of the dignity of a citizen to a large proportion of the population (Waldron [2013a,](#page-252-0) p. 340). Michael Rosen, however, suggests that the idea of levelling-up to ensure equality in statusbased conceptions bears little meaning (Rosen [2013)](#page-252-0), and Jacob Weinrib argues Waldron's attempt to use historical meanings of dignity as a status-concept to explain modern constitutional practices is unsatisfactory even if influential (Weinrib [2016](#page-253-0), p. 24). The reason Weinrib provides is that Waldron gets things backwards: Waldron does not explain why human dignity constitutes the relevant standard for evaluating legal conventions and argues instead that human dignity "is itself the product of legal conventions" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 28).

Waldron's argument is consistent nevertheless with Charles Taylor's approach to modern social imaginaries, including as to the manifestation of the general will in the public sphere by a sovereign people as a key plank of the modern constitutional state (Taylor [2004)](#page-252-0), and Weinrib concedes Waldron's view of dignity as a convention about legal, political or social rank is capacious (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 26). Thus Waldron's understanding of human dignity as a status-concept endures, with Waldron stating it makes sense of the rights and norms that may be gathered together regarding "the special and momentous significance of the individual human person" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 8). Indeed, Waldron's later work affirms human dignity's ability to make sense of "our active political equality in democratic and electoral arrangements", the power of citizens to participate, and their standing to demand accountability for exercises of public authority (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), pp. 3–4).

Within a modern constitutional state, including as relevant to legislative authority, Waldron argues that human dignity as status-concept is tied also to ambitions for dignity as a juridical concept. This second particularisation of Waldron's dignitarian literature is examined in Sect. 3.

### 3 A Juridical Concept

Weinrib explains the term 'juridical' refers to a relationship between a state and its people "comprised of rights and corresponding duties that regard each party not as an isolated entity, but as the participants in a common association" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 75). Waldron similarly describes human dignity as having a legal status that, like infancy or bankruptcy, "sums up the whole normative condition of a person in certain circumstances". It follows from the circumstances of being a private person (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 8). In short, dignity's "proper home" is in law (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) pp. 14, 134).

Presenting the Berkley Tanner Lectures in 2009, Waldron identified an imperative to move away from earlier "bland generalities" about human dignity and towards dignity as a juridical concept, an entitlement of each person in a modern constitutional state (Waldron [2012a)](#page-252-0). In an interview complementing the Lectures, Waldron said analysis of the legislation responding to terrorism in the United States including the US Patriot Act enacted in 2001 caused him to re-appraise the earlier conceptualisation of human dignity (Institute of International Studies University of California [2009)](#page-252-0). Attempts to speak with purpose about legislative constraints on the imposition of "cruel", "inhuman", and "degrading" treatment and punishment commonly involve bland generalities, he says. These divert from the specifics; for example, a broad dignitarian reading of human dignity constitutes no more than "a broad catch-all restraint", distracting from the explicit and detailed restraints provided by human rights and humanitarian law (Waldron [2010,](#page-252-0) pp. 290–291).

The modern notion of dignity, Waldron proposes, "involves an upwards equalization of rank, so that we now try to accord to every human being something of the dignity, rank, and expectation of respect that was formerly accorded to nobility" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) p. 33). Referring again to Vlastos's suggestion that we are a single status society, Waldron observes it is a suggestion he takes "very seriously indeed" as it makes it possible to "use aspects of the traditional meaning of dignity associated with high or noble rank, to cast light on our conceptions of human rights" (Vlastos [1984;](#page-252-0) Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) p. 34). Therefore, in moving from bland generalities about dignity, Waldron maintains it is best understood as a status-concept: one referring to the standing of humans in the grand scheme of things, each private person commanding a high level of concern and respect (Waldron [2017,](#page-253-0) p. 3). And Waldron suggests the modern universalisation of the ancient right of a person of noble standing to have her or his voice heard in public matters helps tremendously when we seek to deepen talk of human dignity (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) p. 36).

This levelling up and expansion of honour allows Waldron's dignity-as-rank to underwrite an equal dignity for each private person in a political community (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), p. 6). Rosen describes this as "expanding circle view" of historya political, social and legal conception afforded originally to a small group but widened over time to become universal. It is the idea of the one higher status (Rosen [2013](#page-252-0), pp. 79–80). Waldron agrees there are not different kinds of human person and, in a political community, each person holds the high rank of legal citizenship and has the status of someone to be heard and taken into account (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), pp. 58–60).

As a juridical concept, dignity is understood by Waldron to be a principle of morality and a principle of law" and certainly "a principle of the highest importance, and it ought to be something we can give a good philosophic account of." Explaining that it is not just surface-level rules that have a legal character, Waldron admits he is "enough of a Dworkinian to believe that grounding doctrines can be legal too – legal principles, for example, or legal policies." This is because law "contains, envelops, and constitutes these ideas; it does not just borrow them from morality" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) pp. 13–15). So, in analysing how human dignity works in its proper home in law, Waldron considers on the one hand explicit references to dignity in law such as in constitutions and conventions on human rights. On the other, he considers the way in which the application of law and compliance with it are "deeply dignitarian in their character" (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), pp. 119–129).

The distinct principles—explicit and implicit—are developed in Waldron's jurisprudence where Waldron identifies an increasing importance in the distinction between the principles (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), pp. 135–136, 147n2). In "How Law Protects Dignity", Waldron says the "most obvious way in which law protects dignity is by proclaiming and enforcing specific norms that prohibit derogations from or outrages upon human dignity", as in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions proscribing "outrages upon personal dignity'" (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) p. 200). Implicit protection of dignity, such as "prohibitions on degradation ... in Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights" may be less obvious, but are "deeper, more pervasive, and more intimately connected with the very nature of law" (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) p. 200). The implicit principle concerns how the law is applied, and compliance with the law. Waldron finds "an implicit commitment to dignity in the tissues and sinews of law–in the character of its normativity and in its procedures–and we do well not to sell this short by pretending that dignity is a take-it-or-leave-it kind of value" (Waldron [2012b](#page-252-0), p. 222).

Here too Waldron's literature about the juridical nature of human dignity in a modern constitutional state has developed through engagement with the democratic jurisprudence of others. In the work of Ronald Dworkin, Waldron similarly identifies a clear relationship between human dignity and "the principles and policies that a legal system has committed itself to implicitly" (Waldron [2013b,](#page-252-0) p. 6). While dignity is the "unifying ethical vision" that in Justice for Hedgehogs brings together different facets of Dworkin's comprehensive theory of justice, in Is Democracy Possible Here? Principles for a New Political Debate, Dworkin identifies two dimensions of human dignity: every life is of intrinsic potential value and everyone has a responsibility for realising that value in his or her own life. Dworkin's stated democratic ambition for the two dimensions is that they be understood to be compatible, given they are of sufficient depth and generality to establish common ground across political divides and to generate argument about their interpretation and consequences (Dworkin [2006](#page-251-0), pp. 10–11).

The combined strength in law of the explicit and implicit principles, Waldron suggests, is that they work to enrich and strengthen each other. In combination, an explicit standard and an implicit principle "represent an abundance of riches" (Waldron [2012b](#page-252-0), p. 221). Nevertheless, observing dignity is ever in danger of platitude, Waldron repeats his view of dignity as a status-concept (Waldron [2012b](#page-252-0), p. 201). Armed with this strength, Waldron then explains what he understands human dignity as a juridical status-concept to be; that is, what he means when he asks "about the various ways in which law protects, recognizes, vindicates, or promotes human dignity". It is something like this, he suggests (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) pp. 201–202):

Dignity is the status of a person predicated on the fact that she is recognized as having the ability to control and regulate her actions in accordance with her own apprehension of norms and reasons that apply to her; it assumes she is capable of giving and entitled to give an account of herself (and of the way in which she is regulating her actions and organizing her life), an account that others are to pay attention to; and it means finally that she has the wherewithal to demand that her agency and her presence among us as human being be taken seriously and accommodated in the lives of others, in others' attitudes and actions towards her, and in social life generally.

Thus, dignity is "a genuine making-room for another on a basis of sure-footed equality and acting toward another as though he or she too were one of the ultimate ends to be taken into account" (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) p. 202; Dworkin [2006,](#page-251-0) pp. 127–159). As a juridical concept, dignity defines "a powerful dignity for us all, in ways that enable us to define a distinctive dignitarian content for the ideal of equality before the law". It is the idea of a certain status to be "accredited to all persons and taken seriously in the way they are ruled" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) pp. 36, 202).

Moreover, dignity must function as a normative idea because "people try to do all sorts of things with power". Waldron points out that one of the things people might try to do is "treat certain people as having a status that is lower than this or treat people as though the capacities I have mentioned are unimportant and have no implications for the way those people are ruled" (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), p. 202). A vital point made in this context by Rosen, and with which Waldron concurs, is the importance of being able to identify and condemn degradation in the language of human dignity; respecting a person's dignity involves "treating them with dignity". Even if degradation is merely symbolic, Rosen says, it is powerful nevertheless (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) pp. 94–97). Similarly, Meir Dan-Cohen observes that what is socially and legally granted—such as by legislation—can be socially and legally withdrawn, and a society may fail to confer equal dignity upon all (Waldron [2012b,](#page-252-0) p. 6).

Relevant to human dignity as a juridical value, Waldron engages also with the thought of others about self-application. Waldron refers to law's general reliance on individual application of "officially promulgated norms" (Waldron [2012b](#page-252-0), p. 6):

To embark on the enterprise of subjecting human conduct to rules involves ... a commitment to the view that man is ... a responsible agent, capable of understanding and following rules ... Every departure from the principles of law's inner morality is an affront to man's dignity as a responsible agent. To judge his actions by unpublished or retrospective laws or to order him to do an act that is impossible, is to convey ... your indifference to his powers of self-determination.

Comparable recognition is found in Joseph Raz's publication, The Rule of Law and Its Virtue, where the rule of law is connected to law's "action-guiding character" and relates in turn to the idea of dignity (Waldron [1999b](#page-252-0), pp. 95–96). Raz states that respecting human dignity "entails treating humans as persons capable of planning and plotting their future". This means that respecting people's dignity includes respecting their autonomy, their right to control their future" (Raz [1979,](#page-252-0) p. 214).

Attention is drawn by Waldron also to similarity between Fuller's account of the inner morality of law and the "self-application" of HLA Hart and Albert Sacks (Fuller [1969;](#page-251-0) Hart and Sacks [1994)](#page-252-0). Waldron notes that "the law strains as far as possible to look for ways of enabling voluntary application of its general norms and many of its particular decrees", and this self-application occurs when people apply laws to their own conduct without state coercion. It is, in his view, "an extraordinarily important feature of the way legal systems operate" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) pp. 205–206). Self-application relies upon the capacities of private people for practical understanding, self-control, self-monitoring and for them to modulate their own behaviour as to norms they are able to understand. Law is defined by a near-universal emphasis on self-application, and is differentiated clearly from other systems functioning primarily by manipulating, terrorising or galvanising behaviour. Waldron says that, as recognized by Fuller, self-application represents "a decisive commitment by law to the dignity of the human individual" (Waldron [2012a,](#page-252-0) pp. 205–206). Gregory Alexander supports Waldron's discussion of law's respect for ordinary human agency and his understanding that "the capacity to deliberate about the meaning of open-ended norms [is] an aspect of human dignity" (Alexander [2018](#page-251-0), p. xvii). Waldron in turn notes Dworkin's unifying ethical vision in Justice for Hedgehogs, that "[e]ach person ... has a certain responsibility for the precious shape of his or her own life, and everyone has a duty to respect the conditions under which others are able to discharge that responsibility" (Waldron [2013b,](#page-252-0) p. 6).

Human dignity, as a juridical concept then, affirms dignity's proper home in law. The positioning of dignity explicitly and implicitly within a legal and constitutional framework enables it to work clearly and strongly along both horizontal and axes. As examined in Sect. 4, Waldron describes that work within a modern constitutional state as pervasive and uniting.

### 4 A Pervasive Value

The third particularisation found in Waldron's literature regarding dignity and legislation emerges when human dignity is placed, explicitly and implicitly, within the legal framework of a modern constitutional state. Waldron states that dignity works "as an integrating idea across the whole range of constitutional considerations – structures as well as rights, empowerment as well as constraint." Thus, within modern constitutional states, human dignity performs a "pervasive and uniting function" with specific work to do if invoked in the content of a particular right, but more widely "it helps to mark out the whole of the enterprise" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) pp. 1, 18).

Although traditionally in constitutional practice dignity has not performed an overtly normative role regarding exercises of public authority (Rosen [2013](#page-252-0), pp. 1–2; Hale [2013](#page-251-0), pp. xv–xvi), many modern constitutional states employ the term explicitly when invoking abstract constitutional concepts (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 23–24). In the German and South African constitutions, for example, "all humans have inherent dignity as an attribute independent of and antecedent to any constitutional protection thereof" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 27–28). While Dworkin describes use of the idea of human dignity "almost thoughtlessly either to provide a pseudo-argument or just to provide an emotional charge" (Dworkin [2011](#page-251-0), p. 204), Weinrib's unified theory of public law approaches human dignity as "the organizing idea of a groundbreaking paradigm in public law" that is "invoked as a right or value that imposes an overarching obligation on all public authority." The concept of human dignity, Weinrib says, concerns the "equal right of each person to freedom", and public law "presupposes human dignity as its unifying basis" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 14). Each person has a right to determine the purposes he or she will pursue and a duty to pursue those purposes in a manner respecting the rights of others to freedom (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 1, 7).

Identifying that human dignity is present explicitly and implicitly in constitutional texts and in modern constitutional jurisprudence, Waldron's later literature describes human dignity an "all-pervasive" wide-ranging constitutional value, one to be understood "as a non-fungible value" and affecting "how policy calculations are to be made". Dignity performs an explicit uniting function within many liberal/ democratic constitutions, and affirming the joint, equal attribution of human dignity made by the citizens of a political community when a constitution is enacted (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 19; Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 139–140). Human dignity has particular work to do when it figures in the content of some particular right, but, beyond that, it unites the political community around the joint democratic enterprise. Operating as a wide-ranging constitutional value, human dignity collects up a whole range of ideas—"protections, benefits, structures, empowerments, entitlements, institutions, forms of respect, and equalizations going well beyond a list of individual rights" (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), pp. 6, 15). This pervasiveness of human dignity in the modern constitutional state, Waldron suggests, addresses stated skepticism about the concept's vagueness and malleability (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 15). Some analysis of human dignity finds it to be a "vacuous concept" without boundaries (Bargaric and Allen [2006)](#page-251-0), an indistinct concept that "masks a great deal of disagreement and sheer confusion" (Rosen [2018](#page-252-0), p. 67), an "impossibly vague" idea that does not "provide a universalistic, principled basis" for exercises of public authority (Riordan [2013,](#page-252-0) p. 421), and a subjective idea varying "radically with the time, place, and beholder" (Pinker [2008)](#page-252-0). In Waldron's view, these concerns are over-stated—although there may not be a ready definition of human dignity, there is a history of "attempts over the centuries to say what is special and worthy of respect in the human individual" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 16).

For exercises of public authority in a modern constitutional state, human dignity as a pervasive, juridical concept has important implications. As a juridical concept, dignity further rebuts the stated skepticism about dignity's specificity and the work that it can do. The term juridical goes to the relationship between a state and its people comprising rights and corresponding duties that draw state and private people together into a common association; as a juridical value, human dignity both "justifies public authority and regulates its ongoing operation" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 7, 75). Thus, Waldron refers to dignity's juridical value as "an integrating idea across the whole range of constitutional considerations", empowering as well as constraining (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 1). When human dignity is a pervasive juridical value in the constitutional framework, "each person has both a right and a duty to interact with one another" on terms consistent with that value: with respect for each person's equal freedom (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) pp. 15, 75). Indeed, Alexander argues that the duty extends to awareness of obligations to future generations (Alexander [2018,](#page-251-0) p. 129).

The pervasiveness of human dignity as a juridical concept in modern constitutional states serves also to strengthen and consolidate Waldron's theory regarding legislation and dignity. As a "capacious convention" (Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 26), and a wide-ranging constitutional value, the concept of human dignity allows Waldron to collect under the one "constitutional" umbrella his legal, political and social thought. There is room under the umbrella, for example, for theoretical analysis regarding dignity and citizenship, entitlements of private persons in modern constitutional states, dignity and legislation, and law and disagreement. An approach to human dignity as a pervasive, juridical concept additionally furthers Waldron's objective of enriching legal theory with the resources of political theory to enhance democratic and legal practice (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 3). Three specific examples of the practical usefulness of dignity as a juridical concept and a pervasive constitutional value, as relevant to exercises of legislative authority, are provided.

First, Waldron argues equal respect and dignity "are not just abstract philosophical theses about Kantian imperatives" but, when embodied in political systems, equal respect and dignity "are among the most important values that there are – not least because they entangle themselves with and intensify what people fear from, or hope for, so far as their political institutions are concerned" (Waldron [2016](#page-252-0), p. 10). Accordingly, citizens insist their governments treat private people with dignity and demand legal and political constraints are in place to ensure governments do so. Insistence on the rule of law, Waldron says, is insistence that all are treated with dignity, even if coercion is sometimes necessary in lawgiving (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 19).

Second, Waldron draws attention to Arendt's identification of a felt need for legislative representatives to act according to a set of enduring procedures constituting a "stable worldly structure to house their combined power of action" (Arendt [1958,](#page-251-0) p. 41). Waldron notes the use of "worldly" indicates a focus on structures more enduring than the actions and legislators they house, structures which exist as features of a world humans have made for themselves (Waldron [2016,](#page-252-0) p. 293). Political theory holds it possible to design democratic structures and processes to balance the self-interest of men and to further the common good, as evidenced by principles of legislation that are "shared by the adherents of rival theories of justice" and "among rival agendas for public policy" (Waldron [2016](#page-252-0), p. 147). Indeed concerns about the influence of particular politicians upon lawgiving arise because of the importance of public authority. Legislators: "exercise power; they have an impact on people's lives; they bind whole communities; they impose costs and demand sacrifices." Waldron says that for these reasons neither law, nor the exercise of legislative authority, is a game (Waldron [2016](#page-252-0), p. 150).

Third, disagreement and argument are essential to the making of legislation in a modern constitutional state. On the one hand this is to ensure authoritative legislation, standing in the name of all private people in a political community, is enacted via a process respecting of human dignity (Waldron [2012c](#page-252-0), pp. 109–110):

We have democratic institutions because we want to maintain equal respect for one another in the midst of our disagreements. We have human rights on account of our vulnerability to the worst excesses of human power. We demand economic freedom, free markets, and private property because our life-plans are different from one another and because we know that there is no other way to reconcile our varying preferences in a coherent way of life. And we subject ourselves to the discipline of the Rule of Law so that we can be governed in a way that respects our dignity in the forms and procedures that are used.

On the other, disagreement and argument are essential in a political community because the plurality of private people will reasonably disagree about some matters; for example, how a right should be stated in legislative form. For some matters, such as health care and privacy perhaps, the community will not dispute what equal freedom of each person requires, and there will likely be a direct statement of that requirement without any legislative reference to human dignity. However, where there is no shared benchmark, dignity itself may be used as the standard. An example provided by Waldron is Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights requiring "remuneration ensuring ... an existence worthy of human dignity" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 5).

As a juridical concept, and a pervasive value across legal and constitutional considerations, Waldron notes that the objective of democratic argument about dignity is not, as Rosen suggests, to assign different meanings of human dignity to its different occurrences (Rosen [2018,](#page-252-0) pp. 59–60). It is to ensure legal and political deliberation occurs to identify the legislative limits set at the relevant time by a political community; that is, "we ask questions about human dignity as a way of pinning it down" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 5). Asking questions about dignity is therefore a democratic mechanism. It reconciles varying preferences into a coherent way of life and, in a modern constitutional state, democratic argument authorises and constrains exercises of legislative authority. Thus, as examined in the final section, human dignity as a contested concept furthers the momentous entitlement of each person to equal freedom (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), p. 36).

### 5 Contestation

It is compellingly proposed by Conor Gearty that the "beauty of the democratic approach to dignity is that it manages ... differences and resolves them" (Gearty [2013,](#page-251-0) p. 168). Waldron's dignitarian literature particularising human dignity is instrumental to this understanding of the democratic approach to dignity, as examined in previous sections. The particularisations of dignity developed by Waldron dignity as a status-concept, a juridical concept, and as a pervasive constitutional value—serve also to facilitate deliberative argument about its proper use.

Lady Hale observes that, as a status term human dignity "is the sort of meaning a lawyer can understand ... a precise description of a status attached to a particular individual, a status which by definition only a few can have." However, if it is to have a pervasive and uniting function in a modern constitutional state, and to have a contemporary meaning such that human dignity is "that all people must be treated equally as well as valued equally", although the law "may eventually have reached this point, ... the lawyers did not invent such a major shift in political thinking." Rather, "[t]he people did that" (Hale [2013,](#page-251-0) p. xv). They were "[f]reedom-fighters, levellers, feminists even, who knew that they were not being accorded their proper respect as human beings and sometimes called this dignity" (Hale [2013,](#page-251-0) p. xvi). Waldron similarly points to monumental reforms effected by legislation in such circumstances. Examples include "[t]he prohibition of child labour, the reform of the criminal process, the limitation of working hours, the dismantling of segregation, the institution of health and safety regulations in factories, the liberation of women" (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 101).

Definitions in law do not always "come in the form of a checklist of necessary and sufficient conditions" but as a contested concept human dignity encourages crystallization in democratic argument (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 16). That crystallization is necessary in political communities where the aspiration is for legislation to be made by way of "concerted, cooperative, coordinated or collective action in the circumstances of modern life" (Waldron [1999a,](#page-252-0) p. 156; Waldron [2012b;](#page-252-0) Habermas [2010,](#page-251-0) p. 469). In the same way, Waldron notes the lack of a ready definition may challenge but not disqualify the use of dignity in legal argument. This is because "[w]e sometimes need concepts in law that challenge the demands of technical advocacy and that invite serious normative reflection, ideas whose elaboration involves continual argument about their proper application" (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), p. 16; Gearty [2013](#page-251-0), p. 162).

When the concept of dignity is contested, there is a clear role for theory; that is, when "the content of what we have to respect in one another remains something of a mystery" (Hale [2013,](#page-251-0) p. xvi). In these circumstances, dignity supplies a value, or a set of values, that other approaches do not (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), p. 5; Habermas [2010](#page-251-0), p. 479). As identified by Lady Hale and by Waldron, the legislative limits are formed by the private people in a political community knowing when they are being accorded their proper respect as human beings, and the role of theorists is to supply the thinking behind that knowing (Hale [2013,](#page-251-0) pp. xv–xvi). Private people and theorists alike therefore ask questions about human dignity as a way of pinning it down (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), p. 5; Gallie [1956](#page-251-0)). Jürgen Habermas refers to human dignity as a 'portal' via which morality's "egalitarian and universalistic substance ... is imported into law" (Habermas [2010,](#page-251-0) p. 469).

For such an inquiry, Waldron draws upon the history of human dignity as a statusconcept, referring to a history of past attempts "to say what is special and worthy of respect in the human individual" (Waldron [2019,](#page-253-0) p. 16). There is support from Liora Lazarus for this reference to the history dignity comes trailing. Lazarus proposes that, as "what may be viewed as disagreements on matters of principle [may be] premised on untested prejudices, ungrounded factual assertions or even selfinterested arguments", resourcing of history and philosophy may be a crucial persuasive device in strengthening the fabric of political debate (Lazarus [2012,](#page-252-0) pp. 239–248). Support too from Habermas for Waldron's understanding of a rank generalisation process that means that "all citizens now acquire the highest rank possible" (Habermas [2010,](#page-251-0) p. 473). Habermas adds though that "universalization must be followed by individualization", and "the relative superiority of humanity and its members must be replaced by the absolute worth of any person" (Habermas [2010,](#page-251-0) pp. 473–474). For Habermas, the concept is "the unique worth of each person" (Habermas [2010,](#page-251-0) p. 474). Charles Taylor however argues that, as more than one shared good is sought in a 'secular' and plural modern state, public authority must be exercised neutrally as between citizens and values to enable all people of very different outlooks to respect the authority of legislation and the authority of the state (Taylor [2010](#page-252-0), pp. 25, 29; Taylor [2004](#page-252-0), pp. 170–171; Taylor [2011](#page-252-0), p. 36). Moreover criticisms of the problems arising from "the relationship between organized and hierarchical religions and the use of dignity" are frequent in scholarly literature about human dignity, and for this reason, it is common for an overtly secular meaning of human dignity emerging "in the aftermath of the horrors of World War II" to be referenced (McCrudden [2013,](#page-252-0) p. 30; Weinrib [2016,](#page-253-0) p. 25). So, in a plural and secular but democratic political community, we collaboratively and equally pose questions about dignity.

As an "essentially contested concept" that empowers and constrains legislative authority, the proper democratic use of human dignity "involves continuing argumentation about its proper use" (Waldron [2019](#page-253-0), p. 16 n57; Gallie [1956](#page-251-0)). Dignity is a concept around which we can meet and discuss. It is of particular utility when it might be necessary to introduce deep transformations in broadly-held social and cultural expectations and perceptions (Carozza [2013](#page-251-0)). Bernhard Schlink identifies the functionality as equivalent to Sehnsuchtsbegriff, a "concept that encapsulates our yearning for a recognition and protection of humans that is not up for grabs (political grabs, balancing grabs)" (Schlink [2013)](#page-252-0). Weinrib argues that contestations about dignity demand that legislation be made via a public process designed to ensure the legislation conforms as closely as possible to the legal, political and social norms shared by people in the state (Weinrib [2016](#page-253-0), p. 15). This functionality is capable of addressing the concern of Dworkin that most people on one side of a democratic policy debate "seem persuaded that it is useless to try to argue with or even to understand the other side" (Dworkin [2006](#page-251-0), p. 5). Indeed, the contested juridical <span id="page-251-0"></span>concept of human dignity as a pervasive constitutional value "leaves open difficult conundrums of moral philosophy, while allowing us to make progress on the central issues and main practical ramifications associated with the concept of dignity" (Waldron [2016,](#page-252-0) p. 5).

Waldron's vision is for the sense of how dignity is being put to work in law to grow and develop (Waldron [2012a](#page-252-0), p. 135). Relevant to exercises of legislative power in a modern constitutional state and commencing with publication of The Dignity of Legislation and Law and Disagreement, Waldron's analysis of human dignity, and Waldron's engagement with the dignitarian analysis of other theorists, continues to develop greater specificity about human dignity. Regrettably, while "lively debates" are had with Waldron about, for example, legislation being made in the circumstances of politics, the scholarly debates are not accompanied in most cases by "close analysis" of Waldron's dignitarian arguments (Latham-Gambi [2021,](#page-252-0) p. 243; Posner [2000)](#page-252-0). Waldron's body of work, however, is settling dignity more securely in its proper home in law, and identifying more instructively dignity's pervasive value in a modern constitutional state. In an era when democracy is beset by manifold challenges, the essentially contested concept of human dignity works to mark out the whole point of a modern constitutional state and is an indispensable concept around which all private people in a plural, secular democracy may meet to argue and discuss when law is given.
