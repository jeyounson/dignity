# Human Rights, Rights of the Other, and Preventive Peace: A Levinasian Perspective

![](_page_218_Picture_1.jpeg)

Augusto Ponzio

Abstract Human rights, rights of the other and preventive peace are closely interconnected, as evidenced above all by the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1996). Particularly interesting on this account is his 1985 essay, "The Rights of Man and the Rights of the Other". With this distinction Levinas evidences how as the rights of identity, human rights do not include the rights of the other. The relationship with the face of the other is a relationship in which single individuals are taken into account not on the basis of identity, role, genre, ideological position, but of their reciprocal absolute (non-relative), irreducible, infinite alterity. In the face of the other the single individual is called to answer without alibis, outside the roles foreseen by functional and productive communication. The other is inseparable from the I, the same, and as étranger, absolutely other, the other cannot be included within the totality of the same (cf. Ponzio 2006b, 2007). The other is necessary to the constitution of the I and its world, but at the same time it is refractory to all those categories that wish to extinguish its alterity, thus subjecting it to the identity of the same. Limitations on individual responsibility, limitations of an ethical-normative, juridical and political order, behavior regulated by the laws of equal exchange, functions fixed by roles and social position, distinctions among individual identities sanctioned by law: none of this will succeed in undoing the intricate tangle between self and other, in absolving the I from responsibility for the other. To recognize this means to act for preventive peace.

However much we keep account of Reality and History in thinking about Future History, however much Politics is instructed by History, we continue repeating the same errors, the same horrors of Reality and Past History owing to our insistent reference to the category of Identity. To perceive such repetition and to avoid

deluding ourselves into believing that development, innovation and progress are possible on the basis of the Identical, we need a viewpoint that is 'other'.

Only by recourse to the category of Alterity, Otherness will it be possible to imagine a development in history that is other with respect to past history: the category of Otherness reveals the extent to which the History of Reality and Politics, of War and Peace is constantly repeated. The other's point of view, comprising recognition itself of the other which makes such a viewpoint possible, interrupts the monotony of repetition (cf. Catone and Ponzio [2005](#page-231-0); De Leonardis and Ponzio [2008)](#page-231-0).

The Critique of Occidental Reason thus understood requires a point of view that is other, and as such calls for a 'Critique of Dialogical Reason'. The critique of dialogical reason is the critique of the category of Identity. An approach that is radically critical calls for preliminary recognition of the other, or, better, acknowledgement of the fact that recognition of the other is an inevitable necessity (cf. Petrilli et al. [2005](#page-232-0); Ponzio et al. [1998](#page-233-0); Ponzio [2006a,](#page-232-0) [2008a,](#page-232-0) [2008b)](#page-232-0).

Recognition of the other not as a concession, a free choice made by the I, the Subject, the Same, but as a necessity imposed by alienation of Identities, the loss of sense, by the situation of homo homini lupus (the allusion is to Hobbes's fallacy!). The latter is not mythically antecedent, but ensues from such concrete abstractions as Freedom, State, Politics, Law.

The Preface to Totality and Infinity (Eng. trans. of Levinas [1961](#page-231-0)) by Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1975) starts with the question if lucidity, the mind's openness upon the true, consists in catching sight of the permanent possibility of war (on Emmanuel Levinas, see Ponzio [2019](#page-233-0)). On the basis of the connection between war, ontology, politics, history, totality, and truth in the perspective of Western Reason, the answer is necessarily affirmative.

The protestation of an individual in the name of his personal egoism or even of his salvation is of no avail: '[...] a proclamation of morality based on the pure subjectivism of the I is refuted by war, the totality it reveals, and the objective necessities' (Levinas 1996, p. 25).

Given the irrefutable evidence of the totality and the opposition of peace to war, 'evidence of war has been maintained in an essentially hypocritical civilisation, that is, attached both to the True and to the Good, henceforth antagonistic' (Ibid., p. 24).

The relationship with the face of the other is a relationship in which individuals do not exist as identities, roles, genera, ideological positions, but on the basis of themselves, of their reciprocal absolute (non-relative), irreducible, infinite otherness—therefore not on the basis of the totality. Such individuals have the possibility of producing 'signification without a context'.

In the face of the other the individual is called to answer without alibis, and thus understood the individual can speak standing outside the roles and parts played by the same in the ordinary system of functional and productive communication. Individuals can speak 'rather than lending their lips to an anonymous utterance of history' (Ibid., p. 23).

Peace—says Levinas—is produced as this aptitude for speech (Ibid.).

This peace is the fundamental relationship with the other. There is not only the peace of war.

The relation with other and the connected experience of the infinite are the foundation of consciousness, the I, thought, discourse, truth, reason, freedom, identity (cf. Levinas [1963](#page-231-0), [1987a](#page-232-0), [2020](#page-232-0)).

Consequently, once we have abstracted from the intersubjective horizon of the I and from the world, that which remains as I is not a particular way of viewing reality, of depicting it, of evaluating it, of possessing it and transforming it, all being operations that no doubt presuppose the intersubjective relation.

Dialectic from G. W. F. Hegel (1770–1831) to Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980) did not succeed in formulating an effective critique of identity or of Western reason. Levinas's philosophy represents an alternative that needs serious consideration to the end of developing a critique of reason that is based on otherness, a critique of reason that is really dialectic, that is, dia-logic (cf. Petrilli [2006](#page-232-0), [2007](#page-232-0); Petrilli and Ponzio [2005](#page-232-0), [2016](#page-232-0); Ponzio [1990)](#page-232-0).

With the shift in focus from identity (whether individual, as in the case of consciousness or self, or collective, as in a community, historical language, or cultural system at large) to otherness—a sort of Copernican revolution—, the Levinasian critique of monologic reason questions not only the general orientation of Western philosophy, but also the tendencies dominating over the culture engendering it.

Levinas's philosophy is not a philosophy of dialogue but a critique of dialogue according to the dominant conception founded on the category of identity. Throughout his research Levinas developed his critique of a limited, that is, non dialogic conception of dialogue.

For Levinas dialogue is not exchange, it is not communication between that which is said by one person and that which is said by another. Dialogism may be traced in saying itself, independently of exchange, in saying which is not dialogue understood as a relation between giving and receiving, nor therefore as respect, tolerance, sharing, pooling things together, common enterprise, accord, mutual agreement, equal distribution.

Antecedent to the verbal signs it conjugates, to the linguistic systems and the semantic glimmerings, a foreword preceding languages, it [saying] is the proximity of one to the other, the commitment of an approach, the one to the other, the very signifyingness of signification (Levinas [1974](#page-231-0), Eng. trans., p. 5).

According Levinas dialogue is a 'relation to the other' beyond knowledge, and quite apart from the intention and the will of the I. Dialogue is understood as inevitable exposition to the other, impossibility of closure, witness to the inevitability of involvement, necessary non-indifference, finding oneself again and again, in spite of alibis and excuses, in the condition of having to answer to the other and for the other, irrevocable responsibility.

Levinas is strongly stating his opposition to the concept of dialogue understood as a relationship between two preconstituted and autonomous subjects who decide to exchange ideas.

On the contrary, as formulated by Levinas, dialogue is passive witness to the impossibility of escape from the other; it is passive witness to the fact that the other cannot be eluded, to the condition of involvement with the other apart from initiative taken by the subject who is called to answer to the other and for the other (cf. Levinas [1934,](#page-231-0) [1935)](#page-231-0).

The other is inseparable from the I, the same (Même as intended by Levinas), and as etranger, absolutely other, it cannot be included within the totality of the same. The other is necessary to the constitution of the I and its world, but at the same time it is refractory to all those categories that wish to extinguish its otherness, thus subjecting it to the identity of the same.

Otherness is not outside the sphere of the I, which does not lead to its assimilation, but, quite on the contrary, gives rise to a constitutive impediment to the integrity and closure of the I as Identity, as totality, as the same (cf. Levinas [1987b](#page-232-0)). The relation with the other is intended as a relation of excess, as a surplus, as the overcoming of objectifying thought, as release from the relation between the subject and the object and from the relation of work and trade.

The same/other relation irreducibly transcends the realm of knowledge, the concept, abstract thought, even though the latter are all possible thanks to this relation. Instead the I/other relation, as proposed by Levinas, has an ethical foundation. But what does 'ethical' mean in this context? Levinas gives the following explanation:

We call ethical a relationship between terms such as are untied neither by a synthesis of the understanding nor by a relationship between subject and object, and yet where the one weighs or concerns or is meaningful to the other, where they are bound by a plot which knowing can neither exhaust nor unravel (Levinas [1967](#page-231-0), Eng. trans., p. 116 note).

The meaning of 'ethics' differs here from the traditional acceptation. We may say with Jacques Derrida (Adieu to Emmanuel Levinas, [1999](#page-231-0)) that in Levinas 'Yes, ethics before and beyond ontology, the State, or politics, but also ethics beyond ethics.' Levinas bequeaths to us an 'immense treatise of hospitality', a meditation on the welcome offered to the other (cf. Greisch and Rolland [1993](#page-231-0)).

A movement towards the other without return to the self, to identity, connotes the specifically human present in any human enterprise, in 'all human work [œuvre], commercial and diplomatic' (Levinas [1948](#page-231-0), Eng. trans. 1987; cf. Ponzio [2004](#page-232-0)), what ever this may be. As says Levinas, beyond perfect adaptation to its own goal, the human enterprise

[...] bears witness to an accord with some destiny extrinsic to the course of things, which situates it outside the world, like the forever bygone past of ruins, like the elusive strangeness of the exotic (Ibid., p. 2).

According to Levinas, the true problem for us Westerners is not so much to refuse violence as to question ourselves about a struggle against violence which could be a struggle against the institution of violence (See Levinas [1974](#page-231-0), Eng. trans, p. 177) 'Preventive war' is not a struggle against the institution of violence but is itself violence and feeding violence.

On the contrary, that which is necessary is preventive peace. War against war, war against terrorism, perpetuates that which it is called to make disappear, war against war consecrates war and its virile values in good conscience. Developing Levinas's reflections, we may say that 'just' and 'necessary' wars, 'humanitarian' and 'preventive' wars are wars made with a good conscience. Refusal of violence which languishes in passive non-resistance to evil, and refusal of violence which is war against war may benefit from the alibi of good conscience, but both encourage violence and prime 'infinite war' (see Ibid. See also Ponzio [2009a,](#page-232-0) [b,](#page-232-0) [c)](#page-232-0).

The way to preventive peace is the way of a bad conscience, of patience that does not ask patience of others and is based on a difference between one self and others, on an inequality in a sense absolutely opposed to oppression.

Preventive peace is in non-indifference, non-indifference to the other, to another, non-indifference which is responsibility for the other, 'the very difference between me and the other' (Levinas [1974](#page-231-0), Eng. trans, p. 178).

I am answerable before the other, responsible before all others for all others. I am responsible for the very faults of another. The condition of being hostage is an authentic figure of responsibility for the other. Non-indifference for the other, that is, responsibility without alibis for the other, is openness towards the other than being. This openness is not the initiative of an intentional subject, an effect again of its will, inwardness in being, interest.

This openness has another sense from that of accessibility through open doors or windows, another signification from that of disclosure, or of the will to dialogue. It is openness outside the subject, outside the theme, without the possibility of being absorbed in the 'object', without the possibility of seeing, knowing, understanding, grasping, taking in hand, operating and possessing, outside the good intentions of a subject. Openness is 'disinterestedness' (disinteressement) (Ibid.), it is openness outside the essence (essement)—the process or event of being—outside conatus essendi.

Openness signifies the outside without cover, without shelter, it signifies non-protection, homelessness, non-world, non-inhabitation, layout without security.

But the significations of openness are not only privative: openness signifies the other side of identity, of inwardness, the demythization of the I, the situation before its closure in the abstract notions of freedom and non freedom, the situation in which one is not yet nailed to the I.

There is in openness 'a complex of significations deeper and broader than freedom', where 'inwardness frees itself from itself, and is exposed to all the winds' (Ibid., p. 180). There is exposure without deliberation, which would already be closedness, closure in identity, in its illusory barricades.

Non-indifference is a passivity, wholly supporting. It penetrates identity even in the retreats of its inwardness and obsesses it before all thematization, before taking a foothold in being. Non-indifference is exposure of the subject without his 'as-forme' of defence and aggression, exposure without reciprocity. 'The exposure precedes the initiative a voluntary subject would take to expose itself' (Ibid.). It opens on to the world but is not in-the-world, is non being in the-world.

The restlessness of passivity—a passivity more passive still than the passivity of matter—in the exposure to another, in responsibility for him, the restlessness which takes place without a decision, is restlessness in exposure to another exposure, that is to the openness of a face, the face of the other, the openness of its nudity.

Exposure to another is the asymmetric relation in the face-to-face position (see Ibid., pp. 189–193). The face-to-face position is exposition of one's own nudity, out of role, without position, function, power, defence. It is my relation in my alterity to the other in his alterity.

Alterity in the face-to-face exposition is not relative alterity of roles, positions, functions, power. It is absolute alterity. The exposedness of an alterity to another alterity in the face-to-face relation is before identity, subjectivity, freedom, language, being and it is their condition.

Preventive peace, liberation from the world of war, this opening up, this beyond, is in the proximity of a neighbour. The other, my neighbour, concerns me with a closeness closer than the closeness of the being of things, of world, with a proximity closer than presence, a proximity in his same absence. Proximity of the other is responsibility for the other. Proximity means my not delegable responsibility—in my unicity, oneness, as a unique being—for the other, my subjection to the other, the support of a crushing charge of alterity. Singularisation is not a propriety of the subject itself, but the consequence of the not delegable responsibility of the subject in his alterity to the other in his alterity.

Non-indifference to the other—and ever more in the world of globalisation, to my neighbour—is an openness of self without a world, without a place, is the not being walled in being, the not being nailed to being, 'u-topia' (Ibid., p. 182; cf. Petrilli [2012](#page-232-0), [2016](#page-232-0)).

U-topia with respect to unity, the community, which, in spite of incomparability, the oneness of each one of us, drags us off and assembles us on the same side, 'chaining us to one another like galley slaves, emptying proximity of its meaning' (Ibid.).

U-topia as beyond being, otherwise than being, disinterestedness (dis-interessement), the excluded middle besides being and not being. Exposed to the proximity of the other the I of each individual is virtually a chosen one, called to leave the identity of the ego and its extension in the unity of community, people, agglomerations of peoples, to respond with responsibility: me, here I am, that is, here I am for others.

So in the order or disorder of the modern world, in which peoples and their agglomerations or dispersions are in the desert without the manna of their customs, their wretchedness, their illusions and their, already degenerate, redemptive systems, the subject breaking with identity loses his place radically or his shelter in being, to enter into ubiquity, which is also a u-topia.

Responsibility for the other cannot have begun in my commitment, in my decision. The unlimited responsibility in which I find myself comes from the hither side of my freedom, from a 'prior to every memory', an 'ulterior to every accomplishment', from the non-present par excellence, the non-original, the anarchical, prior to or beyond essence.

The responsibility for the other is the locus in which is situated the null-site of subjectivity, where the privilege of the question 'Where?' no longer holds (see Ibid., p. 10).

U-topia of absolute exposition to the other, responsibility for the other has nothing to do with utopianism considered as such by the realistic vision of modern man who interprets himself as a being among beings, while instead the very character of modernity consists in the fact that it is impossible to remain solidly anchored to self, identity, territory, roots, being, in a word, to remain at home.

Concerning his book Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence, which is exposed imprudently to the reproach of utopianism, Levinas says:

This book escapes the reproach of utopianism – if utopianism is a reproach, if any thought escapes utopianism – by recalling that what took place humanly has never been able to remain closed up in its site (Ibid., p. 184).

In front of the face of the other, the I is called into question. Through its nudity, exposition, fragility, the face says that otherness will never be eliminated. The otherness of others resists to the very point of calling for recourse to homicide and war—being the evidence and proof of the other's irreducibility. Another one, autrui, this other, says Levinas, puts the I into the accusative, summoning it, questioning it, calling it back to the condition of absolute responsibility, outside the I's initiative (cf. Levinas [1949)](#page-231-0).

Absolute responsibility is responsibility for the other, responsibility understood as answering to the other and for the other. This type of responsibility allows for neither rest nor peace. Peace functional to war, peace intrinsic to war, a truce, is fully revealed in its misery and vanity in the light of absolute responsibility.

The relation to the other is asymmetrical, unequal: the other is disproportionate with respect to the power and freedom of the I. Moral consciousness is this very lack of proportion, it interrogates the freedom of self.

It is before the need to answer to others, it is under the weight of unlimited responsibility for others, that the rights and freedom of the self are instituted. The origin of self, which is an origin without an arché, in this sense anarchical, lies in an uneasy conscience in front of others, in a dirty conscience, therefore, in the need to justify one's presence, in one's responsibility without alibis and without escape from others.

In the continued effort to achieve a clean conscience, the self in the nominative, understood as the subject, as intentional consciousness, as speech, derives from interrogating the self and putting it into the accusative. From such interrogation also derive self's freedoms, self's rights—'human rights', elaborated to defend the self summoned by the face of the other to account for the rights of others, in this sense to defend itself as an 'I'.

Prereflexive, confused consciousness, preceding all intention, all will, all aim, which is not acting, but pure passivity, is a bad conscience (see Levinas [1983,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans. 'Non intentional Conscience', in Levinas 1998d). In Levinas the French word 'conscience' is used for both consciousness and conscience. Bad consciousness is ethical conscience.

Without identity, without the protective mask of responsibility delimiting itself in the mirror of the self—self-assured and affirming himself—, without titles, stripped bare of all attributes, consciousness is consciousness not in the world by virtue of its being-without-having-chosen-to-be, as in the Heideggerian Geworfenheit (being 'thrown') (see Heidegger, Being and Time ([1927)](#page-231-0), Eng. trans. 1962, p. 67) but in question: bad conscience (cf. Levinas [1946)](#page-231-0).

Bad conscience is consciousness on the hither side of the self that already puts itself forward and affirms itself, or confirms itself in the world and in being, in the very manifestation of its emphatic identity, in saying 'I'.

Consciousness preceding the consciousness of a subject already distinguished, identified, justified, posited as the 'indeclinable nominative', assured of its right to be, is a questioning of affirmation and confirmation of being, and the accusative in a sense is its first 'case'.

The questioning of being by death, which is always premature, does not perturb or thwart the good conscience of being, or the rights of identity. Bad consciousness is questioning of the very justice of the position in being by the other. Being as bad conscience, being put in question is having to answer to another, to one's fellow man.

The pre-reflective I is the I pre-occupied, non-indifferent, before the face of the other, the I of the bad conscience. The I of the 'good conscience' is the I of the bad conscience who has shielded himself, but has also forgotten, under the justifications of identity and its indifferent difference, the first person of whom the accusative is his first case.

Good conscience is the I of the interchangeable individual who has forgotten the first person who is subject to others and incomparable to others, non-interchangeable, irreplaceable, unique in his responsibility for others and who is precisely not an individual of a genus (see Levinas [1982,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans. 1998, pp. 168–169). The I of bad conscience is the I exposed to the very uprightness of the face of the other who—writes Levinas playing on the dual sense of regarder as 'looking at', 'to concern'—whether he looks at me or not, concerns me [qu'il me regarde ou non, il 'me regard"] (cf. Ibid., p. 171).

The questioning of consciousness and its configuration as bad conscience is the basis of the I: the I starts from the accusative case, from responsibility without alibis for the other. Being in the first person, being myself, being 'I', is having to answer for my right to be, being as bad conscience: being put into question, but also put to the question, being responsible.

Language originates from having to answer for one's right to be, that is, from bad conscience. Having to speak, having to say 'I': this is justification as regards the other. The essence of language is non-indifference, responsibility; it is 'friendship and hospitality' (Levinas [1961,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans., p. 305; cf. Derrida [1997)](#page-231-0).

Identity is a combination of justifications. Bad conscience is non-indifference towards the other, fear for the other: a fear that goes back behind and despite my good conscience and comes to me from the face of the other. The rights of my identity originate in order to justify my 'being in the world' or my 'place in the sun', my home. They originate in order to silence bad conscience and its fear for the other who has already been oppressed or starved by me, by my usurpation of a place that might belong to the other (see Levinas [1983,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans., pp. 130–131. See also Petrilli and Ponzio [2019a,](#page-232-0) [b,](#page-232-0) and Petrilli [2020)](#page-232-0).

The question about my right to be is already my responsibility for the other. To be or not to be, says Levinas, is probably not the question par excellence. The question par excellence, or the first question, is not even the Heideggerian question 'why is there being rather than nothing?', but the question that is repressed by good conscience: 'have I right to be ?' (Levinas [1982,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans., p. 171). Exposed to another in the face-to-face position, the I is without alibis, in the accusative case, in the situation of having to answer for his being in the world, for his place, for his usurpation, for the Da, here, of his own Dasein (here-being) from which the other is excluded.

Return to bad conscience and its responsibility and non-indifference for the other is a suspension of the rights of identity with their negation of all otherness and their exclusion of the other: 'a suspension of war and politics which pass themselves off as relation of the Same to the Other' (Levinas [1983,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans., p. 132). The human, Levinas writes (Ibid.), is the return to bad conscience, to its possibility, as Socrates in Gorgia said, of fearing injustice more than death, of preferring injustice undergone to injustice committed.

Responsibility for the other is the original relation with the other. It is unlimited responsibility. This responsibility, according to Levinas, is the 'secret of sociality'. (Levinas 'Diachrony and representation', in Levinas [1991,](#page-232-0) Eng. trans. p. 169). From the start, the encounter with the other is the responsibility for him, for one's 'neighbour', which is the name for the man, whoever he is, for whom one is responsible. Love, as non-indifference, charity, is original, and it is original peace (See Levinas, 'Philosophy, justice, and love', in Levinas [1991,](#page-232-0) Eng trans., pp. 103–121; cf. Ponzio [2010,](#page-232-0) [2015)](#page-232-0).

Peace cannot be identified with the end of combats that cease for want of combatants, by the defeat of some and the victory of the others, that is with cemeteries or future universal empires. Peace must be my peace, in a relation that starts from an I and goes to the other, in desire and goodness, where the I both maintains itself and exists without egoism (Levinas [1961](#page-231-0), Eng. trans., p. 306).

n Original peace is what Levinas calls an 'asymmetry of intersubjectivity', a exceptional, extraordinary situation of the I. Levinas recalls Dostoevsky on this subject. In Brothers Karamazov, one of the characters says: 'we are all guilty for everything and everyone, and I more than all the others'.

Original peace is the absolute precedence of the face of the other. The face of the other, encounter with the other, requires me as the one responsible for the other. This responsibility is inalienable. It is a responsibility of the I as a singularity, as unique, and such responsibility is different from the responsibility you, as the individual of a genus, yield to someone.

Unlimited and inalienable responsibility for others is the very possibility of the uniqueness of the one and only, beyond the particularity of the individual in a genus. In the relation to the face, to the absolutely weak, to what is absolutely exposed as bare and destitute, responsibility is an election, an individuation without the genus, a principle of individuation.

Says Levinas: 'on the famous problem: "Is man individuated by matter, or individuated by form?", I support individuation by responsibility for the other' (Levinas, 'Philosophy, justice, and love', in Levinas [1991](#page-232-0), Eng trans., p. 108). I am responsible for every man, my neighbour, and no one can substitute me. In this sense I am chosen.

I am responsible for the other, although the other is not responsible for me. As says Dostoevsky, I am responsible for another more than anyone else. The relationship with the other is not symmetrical, it is not at all in Martin Buber (see Levinas, 'Martin Buber and the Theory of Knowledge', in Levinas [1976](#page-231-0), Eng. trans., pp. 17–39).

I am responsible for the other even when he commits crime, even when he bothers me, even when he persecutes me. But I do not live in a world in which there is but one single 'first comer'; there is always another other, a third, who is also my other, my fellow.

The third is himself also a neighbour, and also falls within the purview of the I's responsibility. Otherness, beginning with this third, is a plurality. Proximity is a human plurality. The I has to know which one of the two others has precedence. The I, as responsible for the other and the third, is responsible for their interactions. The I is responsible for the other even when he commits crimes, even when others commit crimes. The I is responsible for the persecution of his neighbours. They have a right to defence. If self-defence is a problem for the I, this problem appears because one threatens his neighbour.

For the I the question of others is a demand for justice. There is a necessity for justice (see Levinas, 'Diachrony and representation' in Levinas [1991.](#page-232-0) Eng. trans., pp. 166–167). There is the obligation to compare unique and incomparable others. This is the moment of knowledge. Justice emerges from responsibility for the other. Responsibility for the other precedes justice. Justice is born from non-indifference, love, charity.

Justice calls for judgement and requires a comparison of what is in principle incomparable, unique. Comparison, equity, objectivity appear with justice. Justice requires perception of the individual in a genus, it requires species and genus.

The I, precisely as responsible for the other and the third, cannot remain indifferent to their interactions, and in the charity for the one, cannot withdraw its love from the other. The self, the I, cannot limit itself to the incomparable uniqueness of each one, which is expressed in the face of each one. Behind the unique singularities, one must perceive the individuals of a genus, one must compare them, judge them, and condemn them.

There is a subtle ambiguity of the individual and the unique, the personal and the absolute, the mask and the face. This is the hour of inevitable justice—required, however, by charity itself.

The hour of Justice, of the comparison between incomparables, who are grouped by human species and genus. And the hour of institutions empowered to judge, of states within which institutions are consolidated, of Universal Law which is always dura lex, and of citizens equal before the law (Levinas, 'The Other, Utopia, and Justice', in Levinas [1991](#page-232-0), Eng. trans., p. 229).

Justice requires judges, institutions, laws and, consequently, the state. A world of citizens, identities, individuals, persons, masks is necessary which belongs to a community, and not only the face to face relationship, of unique to unique. 'If there were no order of justice, there would be no limit to my responsibility' (Levinas, 'Philosophy, justice, and love', in Levinas [1991](#page-232-0), Eng trans., p. 105). Thus the state emerges from the limitation of non-indifference and charity and not, as in Hobbes's vision, from the limitation of violence and fear of others (homo homini lupus).

According to Levinas, the problematic of justice is opened in terms of justice and defence of the other, my fellow, and not in terms of threat that concerns me (Ibid. See also Poirié [1987,](#page-232-0) pp. 104–105 and 115–119. See also Levinas [1974,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans. p. 128). On the basis of justice and state there is not a fear of the other, the other that bothers and persecutes me.

On the basis of justice and state there is a fear for the other, a fear of persecution of my neighbours, because I am, more than anyone else, responsible for the other even when he commits crimes, even when he suffers crimes and persecutions (see Levinas [1974,](#page-231-0) Eng. trans. p. 128).

According to justice, asymmetry of intersubjectivity tends to become symmetry, equality, exchange, relations under the same conditions, equal rights. To treat all men with justice also means to treat myself with justice, and certainly my unlimited responsibility, my responsibility for all, can and has to manifest itself also in limiting itself.

The I is himself third in the relation of the other to another and he too calls for justice. In the name of his unlimited responsibility, the I is called to look after himself, to care for himself. But unlimited and asymmetric responsibility which justifies this concern for justice, for oneself can be forgotten. In this forgetting, says Levinas, consciousness is pure egoism (see Ibid.). Egoistic interests

take dramatic form in egoisms struggling with one another, each against all, in the multiplicity of allergic egoisms which are at war with one another and are thus together (Ibid., p. 4).

Justice founded on non-indifference, charity and love for the other may become indifference and cruelty. Only the responsibility of I as unicity and his relation to the face constitute the reference to which justice and the work of the state must be reconducted, and which they must take as their model.

It is in the name of responsibility for the other, in the name of mercy that the rigors of the dura lex may be mitigated and that justice may be perfected, may become juster.

The title of Levinas's essay 'The Rights of Man and the Rights of the Other' (Levinas [1985,](#page-231-0) in Levinas 1987b, Eng. trans. pp. 116–129), is symptomatic of the possibility of contradiction between claiming the rights of identity as the rights of man and the rights of alterity, as the rights of the other man.

According to Levinas, since the eighteenth century rights, understood in a rigorous and almost technical sense, claimed under the expression 'rights of man', are based on an original sense of rights which springs from responsibility for the other man. The rights of man belong to an original relationship with the other before any legislation and any justification.

In this sense, they are a priori, independent of any initiative and any power, but also independent of the roles, functions and merits of individuals. They are prior to all permits, concessions, authority, entitlement, to all traditions, jurisprudence, privileges, awards or titles, to all will and reason, but also to all theology (Ibid., p. 117).

These rights, that do not need to be conferred, express the absolute alterity of the human individual, i.e. an alterity independent of all relative relationships, of all reference, of all membership to a social community, a social corps, corporation, etc.

This absolute alterity is uniqueness beyond individuality as the specimen of a kind, as the member of a genus, of a class, of a group; it is uniqueness prior to any distinctive sign, uniqueness of the I responsible in the first person for the other.

Thus original responsibility for the other man—in which, as mentioned, according to Levinas lies primordial peace—is the real foundation of the rights of man. These do not depend on the scales of justice. Limited by justice, the rights of man emerge as forced, compulsory rights, and the peace they inaugurate among men remains uncertain and forever precarious: 'A bad peace. Better, indeed, than a good war!' (Ibid., p. 122).

Like real peace, human rights become repressed and abstract rights are obtained from the power of the State, by politics and its strategies and clever dealings. Limited by justice the rights of man remain bounded within a community and connected with peace that the obedience to the law, imposed by force, obtains and ensures.

Instead, as founded in original non-indifference and responsibility for the other man, the rights of man correspond, says Levinas, 'to a vocation outside the State, disposing, in a political society, of a kind of extra-territoriality' (Ibid., p. 129) and independence.

In a liberal State that guarantees this independence, justice is founded on the rights of man, and not vice versa. At the least tendentially, the rights of man and the rights of the other man should coincide.

But liberalism and democracy are powerless in the face of fascism if the rights of man defended by their justice are not also, at least tendentially, the rights of the other man.

Like justice, freedom cannot be assumed as foundational to the rights of man, not only because freedom is itself one of man's rights, but also because it presupposes responsibility for the other man and is based itself on the prior peace of the relationship of one non-interchangeable individual to another, of unique to unique, of incomparable to incomparable. In other words, freedom is itself based on the relationship of the one facing the other, that is, of the I for the other.

My own freedom starts in relation to the other who appeals to my irreducible and non-transferable responsibility.

My freedom and rights, that is, the freedom and rights of any identity manifest themselves in non-indifference toward the other, in responsibility for the other, for the rights of alterity, prior to manifesting themselves as my freedom and rights, that is, as the freedom and rights of a particular identity. These rights and this responsibility can never be exhausted given that it is not possible to extinguish our debt to others.

In today's world, fear of the other understood as fearing the other, fear that the subject experiences of the object, has reached paroxysmal degrees. However, contrary to the Hobbesian principle of 'homo homini lupus', such paroxysm is not the starting point but the point of arrival in the constitution of identity.

In Western history, identity has always prevailed over otherness; difference and relative indifference have always prevailed over non-indifference; relations among individuals belonging to the same genus, with ever more restricted responsibilities, have always prevailed over relations without alibis among singularities outside genera (cf. Levinas [1994)](#page-232-0).

Capitalism has constructed its socio-economic reproductive system on identity, to the point of exasperation. This means to say that capitalist ideology has developed the subject's fear of the other—object—, to paroxysmal degrees, ever more limiting and attenuating the attitude of fear for the other. In today's world, fear of the other understood as fearing the other, fear that the subject experiences of the object, has reached paroxysmal degrees (On the relation between signs and ideology in today's economics system, see Ponzio [1993](#page-232-0), [2008c,](#page-232-0) [2009a,](#page-232-0) [b,](#page-232-0) [c,](#page-232-0) [2011,](#page-232-0) [2012,](#page-232-0) [2020;](#page-233-0) see also Rossi-Landi [1990)](#page-233-0). However, contrary to the Hobbesian principle of 'homo homini lupus', such paroxysm is not the starting point but the point of arrival in the constitution of identity.

A paradox connected with globalisation today in its current phase of development is that social relations emerge as relations among individuals who are separate from each other, reciprocally indifferent to each other. The relation to the other is suffered as a necessity for the sake of achieving one's own private interests. And exclusive preoccupation with one's own identity, with one's own difference indifferent to the differences of others, increases fear of the other understood as fearing the other.

Following this type of logic, the community is the passive result of the interests of identity that are indifferent to each other. Indeed, the community so construed presents itself as a compact identity only as long as its interests require cohesion and unification.

The egological community, the community of selves forming the identity of each one of us presents the same type of sociality. This is sociality founded upon relations of reciprocal indifference among differences and identities.

Such a condition results from and at once is evidenced by separation between public behavior and private behavior in the same individual subject, separation and mutual indifference among roles, competencies, tasks, languages, among responsibilities in the same individual, in the same subject, separation viewed as the 'normal' or 'standard' way of conforming to the social system that subject belongs to.

Limitations on individual responsibility, limitations of an ethical-normative, juridical and political order, behavior regulated by the laws of equal exchange, functions fixed by roles and social position, distinctions among individual identities sanctioned by law, identities and differences whose sphere of freedom and imputability is at once delimited and guaranteed by law. None of this will succeed in undoing the intricate tangle between self and other, in eliminating the inherent <span id="page-231-0"></span>asymmetry in the relationship between self and other, in impeding obsession for the other, in ending involvment, in avoiding substitution.

Responsibility for others has a dual orientation: the other is elevated and taken upon one's own shoulders, so to say, producing an asymmetrical situation. As says Levinas, the person I must answer for is also the person I must answer to. I must answer to the person whom I must answer for. Responsibility in the face of the person I am responsible for: responsible for a face that regards me, for freedom.
