# Images and Counter-Images of Humanitas: A Jusaesthetic Approach to the Problem of Law's Normative Validity: Beyond the Blindness-and-Sightedness Polarity

Abstract Amid the complexity of the "post-modern jurisprudences", in which the traditional dualisms of modernity are intended to be eroded (Minda), aesthetic criticism presents the ambition of restoring a humanist and pluralist (ethically inspired) sense of justice in the kernel of law's culture and the discourse of legal thinking. Defying paradigmatic understandings of legal vision (law's ability of sightedness), aestheticism offers, then, alternative comprehensions of law's cultural place and civilizational meaning that are expressly designed as the counter-image of those which reflect centripetal (law-oriented) understandings of the role that law, as a project of normative validity, must play in the context of ordinary life, constitution of selves, and in the constitution of its own discourse. Is this aestheticization simply yet another sign of the definitive decline of a culturally shaped narrative of law... or could it be reassessed alternatively, from a constructive, juridical, and internally critical perspective, seeing law as a particular experience of sightedness—an experience of jusaesthetics? This paper responds affirmatively to this question.

### 1 Introduction

Amid the complexity of the "post-modern jurisprudences", in which the traditional dualisms of modernity are intended to be eroded (Minda [1995,](#page-298-0) pp. 3, 189), aesthetic criticism presents the ambition of restoring a humanist and pluralist sense of justice in the kernel of law's culture and the discourse of legal thinking. This is pursued by putting under suspicion fixed structural divisions between a "world" of law, which is characterized as an institutionally (bureaucratically) controlled and artificially constructed social world of (precarious) sightedness, and the incommensurability, complexity, and, ultimately, welcome unpredictability, of an indefinable "free" world outside law (outside the realm of legal vision)—a world of sensorial "life"

and "experience", and, in a relative sense, of the immediacy of blindness, aloof to normative predetermination.

Is this aestheticization simply yet another sign of the definitive decline of a culturally shaped narrative of law, one already dismissed by the "constellation of discourses" (Linhares [2007)](#page-298-0) and experiences growing in parallel ... or could it be reassessed alternatively, in a constructive, juridical, and critical perspective—an alternative to the usual "alternatives to law" (C. Neves)? That is, would it be possible to shift the language of criticism towards a perspective in which aesthetics emerges rather in and as a movement towards the law, or a place to reimagine law's very own principle of humanity—as an experience of jusaesthetics? And, in such a way, would it be possible to assert jusaesthetics as a necessary critical (re)affirmation of a pluralist and heterogenous, yet internally driven, project of normative validity a contribution, at the end, to the very fabric of law criticism tries to escape? Engaging in this discussion, this paper offers an affirmative answer to these questions.

### 2 Law's Interrupted Eye and Aesthetic Criticism

According to the idiom of law and aesthetics' criticism, being a person in the juridical realm is like becoming a fictitious persona. In part as a basic requirement of law's cultural nature or the cultural nature of the kind of praxis legal experience entails,1 but, mainly, as a distortion of such a nature created by legal formalism and "orthodoxy", becoming a subject according to law would imply the pre-defined (pre-scripted) possibility of impersonation, conceived as an act of performative, even theatrical, imagination. The theatrical here highlights the farcical habits—the artificiality—of legal language and legal culture, their tendency—even, their necessity—to turn life into textual archetypes, fiction, and, mostly, into caricatures. This is exactly the opposite of the performative nature of the theatrical highlighted by Leiboff, in line with Sarrazac, which requires the suspension of "any belief that we hold in the textual certainties"—the conception of a world close to the immediacy of experience, a world "that it is not word dependent, and more particularly, it is action" (Leiboff [2010](#page-298-0), p. 388).

Far from this performative conception, becoming a subject in legal lenses would demand the person to be seen to wear an undifferentiated disguise by which "the screen" of the legal order, imposing its own conditions of visibility, makes such a person a product of the eye in the first place;2 it implies an act of conditional sight, a decision—and, with this, an interruption, suppression, from multiplicity.

<sup>1</sup> "[A]ll cultural praxis consists in imposing a new, artificial order on the natural one" (Bauman [2000](#page-297-0), p. 96).

<sup>2</sup> "The operation of normative systems (religion, morality, increasingly law) interposes a 'legal screen' between the subject and the social gaze, filtering the objects of vision and determining the way in which we see and are given to the world to be seen" (Douzinas [2008](#page-297-0), p. 18; [2011](#page-297-0), p. 253).

On the other side of the coin, through such a screen, as it gives birth to the subject, the law would manage at the same time to delude (even though temporarily and insufficiently) its allegedly inherent condition of blindness, turning it into a particular, although partial and precarious, experience of visibility. The subject, who is artificially understood as it is strategically created, represents both the law's ability and inability to see, as the result of a limited experience of poíēsis. If, agreeing with J. Rancière, "the image is never a simple reality" ([2007,](#page-299-0) p. 6), the juridical shapes keep creating images that, giving "visual form to the invisible and mak[ing] present what is absent" (Douzinas [2011,](#page-297-0) p. 247), as near to life as they are to death, are far from having ontological quality,3 simultaneously presenting, and misrepresenting, what they unveil—the being.4 In the legal realm images are notably designed to attend to narrow requirements of linguistic specificity and vocabulary limitations, with their simplifying, general normative patterns.

To be born, then, the juridical person loses her own identity to gain another, i.e., she loses her phenomenological, umbilical connection to the very condition of human experience (her "absolute otherness"), as she joins "the plot" of an autonomous Being5 and is translated into the normative character a previously fixed language and vocabulary prescribe, a language that, by its own, could only mirror and foresee the caricature images of homo juridicus (A. Supiot)—the individual pre-moulded to and post-carved in a concept, deprived of personal traits and freed from private roots and bondings (Haarscher [1997,](#page-298-0) p. 27).

Whilst such images inform one of the strands of "the normative body of the individual", they themselves embody specific "regimes of visibility" (Douzinas [2008,](#page-297-0) p. 18; [2011,](#page-297-0) p. 249-ff.)6 that, besides creating the possibility of existence of the legal person, are instrumental both to the self-preservation of the discourse of authority, on the one hand, and to the self-isolation ("scientific" preservation) of the

<sup>3</sup> In this phenomenological approach to images, the images are not entrusted with representational, but with presentational, capacities—"[w]ithout the image there would be no thing for us, no presence and, as a result, no subject could be called into existence. [...] The image both brings to presence and withholds beings" (Douzinas [2011,](#page-297-0) p. 248).

<sup>4</sup> "Without the image there would be no thing, no presence and no subject. In this ability of disclosing things, the image is a prodigious and forceful entity. It confers unity and identity to the thing, by arranging it for us and reducing its multiplicity. [...] But what the image discloses is not things with ontological solidity. [...] The image stays distant both from the world of beings it brings forth and from the possibilities of availability and utilization it opens. The image presents the absent but also the absence in the thing, the fact that the thing cannot exist without the action of the other through its image. This double absence reminds us that the birth of what we can call the artistic image must be associated with the experience of death" (Douzinas [2008,](#page-297-0) p. 21).

<sup>5</sup> Since otherness, as Pivatto remembers us in his introduction to E. Lévinas's Entre nous, "interrompe a trama do ser", it is the opposite of the Being "e de suas amarras" (Pivatto [1997)](#page-298-0).

<sup>6</sup> "These epochal regimes exist in all cultures even though their naturalisation inhibits their identification. Such regimes form a combination of iconoclasm and iconophilia and amount to a complex administration of an era's available ways of seeing. [...] [They] bring together the sensuate body and approved ways of seeing and create what can be called the 'normative' body of the individual" (Douzinas [2011](#page-297-0), pp. 249, 254).

legal system's integrity, on the other (throughout legal modernity's cycle, such images were expressively set as and in codex, once surrendered to the dominance of literal syntax).

As if the law, having been submitted to the constraints of "orthodox jurisprudence", with its eyes closed or blindfolded, as Justitia illustrates, deprived of images and graphically prevented from seeing (Douzinas [2011](#page-297-0), pp. 252–254),7 had to be necessarily unaesthetic, prohibited from reaching aisthēsis, and the proliferation of law's written expressions, allied to the belief in the alleged guarantees of meaning to be provided in advance by the support of the letter of the text, could eventually be able to overcome the ambivalence and potential dangers and intricacies of law's traditional mythological and pictorial (pre-modern) representations (Jay [1996,](#page-298-0) p. 71; [1999,](#page-298-0) p. 26; Douzinas [2000,](#page-297-0) p. 813).8 According to this legacy, words are treated as secure steps to formal certainty; they communicate directly to and through the interrupted eye. Their character as artefacts that "deploy a visibility that can be blinding" (Rancière [2007](#page-299-0), p. 7) is thought to be overcome by the very siege of reason and its methods. In this sense, the world created by law becomes a world in which such creatures find an artefact (a selection of fictitious tools) for social compossibility, and the values, signs, and symbols through which human experiences are meaningfully lived outside law are erased in the process—so would be the very practical domain of humanity.

This dualism or tension between law's blindness and law's sightedness—which finds its final expression in the prevalence of the former over the latter, as law's impossibility of true sightedness—is then highlighted (explicitly or implicitly) just to be reworked, and then ideally overcome, as the normative core of juridical subjectivity and intersubjectivity continues to be critically reassessed and reinvented by the "apocrypha" (Manderson [2001](#page-298-0)) in contemporary discourse.

The means by which aesthetic reworking happens to be taken forward, in a general sense, reflecting the post-modern quests for opposing narratives (in this case, opposing narratives to the "orthodox" narrative of law), and whether these counter-narratives find their way as counter-images or as counter-scripta, is the one of the deconstructions of expected frontiers between reality, fact and fiction, truth and poíēsis, (macro)normativity and (micro)narrativity, the very intersubjective

<sup>7</sup> Goodrich and Hayaert question the direct association between the blindfolded symbol of Justice and sheer blindness. Offering an etymological perspective of the ambivalence associated to the imago of Justice, they highlight instead possible historical connections with the fasces used by Roman emperors and with the ambivalence and duplicity of legal language, a symbol of an art of words that stimulates "the development of law" (Goodrich and Hayaert [2015](#page-298-0), pp. 14–16).

<sup>8</sup> As a medieval antecedent of the jurist's intention to translate images into the alleged certainty of the written word, according to which "the point would be to submit them to the text regime familiar to the law", Vismann remember Bartolo's Grammar of Signs—"The purpose according to Bartolo was to subject images to the logic of writing because the written word alone was rational and thus accessible to law. The result was a 'Grammar of Signs' in order to curb the rampant use of heraldic insignia, which at the time went unchecked by the authorities. [...] most proposals regarding the law's dealings with images are until this day fashioned after the Bartolo model. A grammar of signs is to restrain the auto-logic of images." (Vismann [2008,](#page-299-0) pp. 3–4).

balancing in juridical praxis between right and duty (with the overall tendency to the hypertrophy of the latter, as a normative projection of a claim of responsibility for the other). In aesthetic criticism, law's own blindness to aspects of life, an outcome of the legal method's faulty connection with the human realm, becomes both a discursive postulate and a precondition of the possibility of "aesthetic" sightedness; in a way, such a precariousness is the symbol of a fragile and faulty experience of humanity, it is its counter-face, an un-humanity. This creates the grounds for sensorial necessity.

Aestheticism offers then alternative comprehensions of law's cultural place and civilizational meaning that are expressly designed as the counter face of those which reflect centripetal (law-oriented) understandings of the role that law must be playing in the context of ordinary life and in its own discourse. In this process, such proposals end up providing legal thinking with alternative methodological and epistemological tools to understand what being a subject in law can possibly mean, which understandings of legal vision it implies, the extension of the normative compromises law, as a cultural artefact, entails, and, ultimately, the ideal community the experience of law should envisage and try to achieve in consequence—after all, a community normatively built outside and beyond law's "internally" comprehended normativity and discourse.

At the base of this criticism, lies, therefore, the reflection of a general quest for the derangement of what are understood as law's fundamental myths, enhancing dimensions of life that escape from any attempt at totalization. What is at stake is an attempt to sculpt manners of surpassing the discourse of law, with its abstract categories and dogmatism, to promote ethics, as a much needed means of expression of singularity.9

However, much of the distrust of critical perspectives in general—and of aesthetic criticism in particular—in juridical possibility of sightedness and in centripetal normative arguments seems to come from a misrepresentation of the complexity of legal experience and discourse. A (mis)representation that restricts and subsumes the cultural image of the "practical world of law" (Linhares [2013](#page-298-0), [2014](#page-298-0)) into one of its facets, the "orthodox" image of a rule of law as archetypally built in the modern cycle, extending the permanence of its wounds and traces. The image (the phantom) of formalism.

### 3 "Formalism" and "Non-formalism"

According to a standard formalist view, law would forge its own normative world or community based on an axiomatic and empirical-explicative reduction of singularity, constraining the limits of subjectivity and intersubjectivity to reinforce imperatives of reason and authority. In this context, being a subject, according to law,

<sup>9</sup> A more comprehensive overview of aesthetic criticism was recently proposed in Duarte ([2021](#page-297-0)).

demands the previous adequacy to law's internally constituted language, and such a language is in fact a sort of monolingual code. Considering that the term formalism is not an easy one, since it can be applied in many different contexts which are not always convergent in terms of their possibilities of determination (Schauer [1988](#page-299-0)), first I shall clarify in which ways I am using it here. If from a general and methodological angle the term formalism can be understood as "the concept of decision-making according to rule" (Schauer [1988,](#page-299-0) p. 510), more strictly, it can be applied still in two complementary senses that, in a typically or fully formalist approach, appear together and in integration,10 but that do not necessarily depend on each other:

First, as a kind of structuralism and comprehension of authority that gives prominence for law's form over its actual contents (Gearey [2001](#page-298-0), p. 4). This privilege of form makes formalism focus on the official legitimacy of the instances responsible for the emanation of law's sources, or the compliance of such instances with the specific procedures through which the same sources are to be constituted. The problem of the legitimacy of content disappears, since it is answered in advance, by a narrow understanding of what the law is and can be, which sources are in charge of creating it, and of what formal or structural requirements of validity they must meet. Therefore, the consonance between the contents prescribed and any kind of potentially shared, cross-cutting axiological-normative compromises and fundaments (that could work as parameters to which law's normative meanings should correspond to become valid) is not an object of concern for legal discourse. And, in this way, law becomes a simple being, a place for reducing complexity, a space for the institutionalization of authority.

Second, in a more directly methodological sense, formalism can be related to the problem of rationality and method to be employed in doctrine and legal thinking. In this sense, I am using the term to refer to a discourse that favours a technicaltheoretical and empirical-explicative scientific logic that masks its own authority (its own "subject" 11) to act and create law in the name of a self-sustaining objectivity and puts itself in conflict with practical reasoning. If practical reasoning focuses on the problem of how the law can be validly performed in the realm of concrete juridical controversies to fulfil certain pre-assumed (presupposed) communitarian ends and goals, or of how juridical practitioners could make sure axiological-normative compromises find their way in concrete, for the former, the problem of achieving theoretical truth is a central one, and it is understood as a matter of obtaining demonstrable, logically verifiable results.12 In this way, a constitutive alliance

<sup>10</sup>As in the main expressions of nineteenth century positivist normativism, namely German Begriffsjurisprudenz and French École de l'Exégèse.

<sup>11</sup>P. Schlag points out this "this eclipse of the problem of the subject" as "a vital, pervasive, constitutive characteristic of American legal thought", which "has been conceptually, rhetorically, and socially constituted to avoid confronting the question of who or what thinks or produces law" (Schlag [1990](#page-299-0), p. 1629).

<sup>12</sup>Remember, at this point, Aristotle's distinction in Metaphysics between two types of epistéme, theòrêtikês and praktikês. See Aristóteles ([1990)](#page-297-0), p. 86 (II, 1, 993b 19–23); Berti ([2004)](#page-297-0), p. 5-ff.

between law's abstract materials and the problematic context in which they are applied (realized) is prevented: the legal experience becomes a mere vehicle to guarantee certainty and security.

Regardless of those features, today, unlike legal modernity, formalism or formalist traits are not a privilege of strictly positivistic and normativist conceptions of law, despite the general frame within which they meet such features had been strongly moulded according to those perspectives. And, more importantly, as regards law's methodology, formalism remains more a shadow of itself than a stable groundwork, and this instability allows for the reproduction of some of its claims even in intentionally non-formalist perspectives. What is more noteworthy is that formalism has been assumed in certain contexts of legal thinking as a plain synonym of law itself—as if, in the end, law's very trajectory and collective meaning had not been simply intercepted or, in important ways, even reinvented, but instead permanently altered, with no way back, means of surpassing or escape, by the normative discourse of modernity. No matter how this same discourse is opposed, or the foundational plot of a unidirectional civilizational transition at the hands of law, as a bulk of formal institutions, is deconstructed and brought under suspicion, the image of the ghost remains alive and well.

That means that formalist vs. non-formalist polarization also remains a shadow in contemporary critical debates in juridical thinking (Duarte [2021)](#page-297-0), in which the foundations of the whole structure sustaining criticism, and giving criticism its reasons, are normally tied up and attached to the very limits of the positions transversely criticized. But how is it possible to distinguish with certainty the point in where law, as a dynamic reality or "form of life" (White [2011,](#page-299-0) p. 382) stops, and discourse begins, if there is any? If there are no limits between the normative and the narrative, historical identity risks being confused with exclusivism, cultural heritage with pure orthodoxy, tradition with traditionalism, autonomy with isolationism, institution with institutionalism, and rationality with rationalism.

So, my underlying argument at this point is that formalism seems to remain, in the end, a caricature, a general defence of law as a serious, tangible, authoritative voice and entity designing its own normative world as an object to be preserved for the very sake of protection, even if the contours of this so-called object are blurred. And it seems to be in this caricature sense, that is, as a synonym of law itself (as if there could be no conceivable image of law and the legal order outside the constraints of a traditional frame), that formalism is assumed by some critical or intentionally non-orthodox strands, such as those perspectives which, in an implicit or explicit way, a reflection on the problem of normative validity and its contents happens to be intertwined with a pluralistic and aesthetic cognition of the multiple levels of discourses and cognitive devices produced in legal culture, their performative capacity, and the limits of juridicity. With some exceptions, in this non-formalist vocabulary, due to that confusion between law and formalist narrative, material juridical contents and civilizational expectations that make the law meet its own conditions of possibility, or its own parameters of normativity, either cease to exist or are not properly discussed. Paraphrasing Schlag, "[s]ometimes it seems as if there is only one story [...]. The story is the story of formalism" ([1990,](#page-299-0) p. 1628). Meanwhile, the discourse of law remains anxious for alternatives, no matter how solid, interesting, fruitful, and relevant its criticism may be. Making aesthetic criticism an alternative to the usual alternatives to law13 requires then, reproaching the law lost in between.

### 4 Jusaesthetic Criticism(s) (Beyond the Criticism of "Law and Aesthetics")

Before exploring some of these points, I just would like to stress, for the sake of clarification, that the discussions of how a kind of aesthetic cognition can be affirmed recalls the long-lasting philosophical reflection on the connections between the human capacities of knowing and of feeling, what knowledge means and how it could be achieved, and of what the role of artistic devices in all that could be. This is a discussion that transcends my goals here, since on the aesthetic debate about law's constitution of selves and whether in this constitution an authentic sense of humanitas can or cannot be achieved by the means of law, what is more important is to explore the links between the appeal to aisthesis and an intentional appeal to ethics, and between law's ability to create normative meanings and the ability of such meanings to deal with complexity.

This appeal to ethics must be read according to a "humanities of resistance", to quote C. Douzinas ([2010)](#page-297-0), which affirms a microscopic perspective of law and subsume it into a macroscopic view of a humanistic ethics or ethics of alterity. In this context, the normative core of juridical subjectivity (and, by extension, of intersubjectivity), when reassessed and reinvented, becomes a means for the accommodation of an argument of indeterminacy that plays a pivotal role in what the aesthetic constitution of juridical subjectivity represents: indeterminacy helps the ethic stabilization of the grounding parameters of recognition of the fuller sense of humanity that law should make its best effort to unmask and attain in concrete, even though this unmasking could only take place temporarily and partially, given the normative limitations of paradigmatic culture. However, if aesthetic criticism in particular and critical thinking in general end up dialoguing only with a conservative perspective either of the legal system or the legal order, of what is a priori assumed as the possible representation of an institutional (authorized) legal reality, such a dialogue, despite its importance and relevance, ends up imprisoning the criticism so

<sup>13</sup>As it was already highlighted in a different opportunity, the 'alternatives to law', according to C. Neves, can be recognized in the arguments in legal discourse for the surpassing or the abandonment of law ("the replacement of the law, in its authentic and differentiating normative sense") and the election of other cultural instances and grounding criteria—like those of science, politics, economics, ethics...—which are expected to deal, by their own means (whilst their rational patterns, methods and modi operandi are claimed in legal thinking), with the ever-present problem of constituting regulative mechanisms for human coexistence—the very problem of intersubjectivity (Neves [2007](#page-298-0), pp. 4, 21; [2013](#page-298-0), p. 42; Duarte [2021](#page-297-0), pp. 19–20).

proposed within a punctual and pre-defined discursive universe, in which positive law appears as that formal framework and the reality that it reveals, creates, and recognizes appears only as a mere secondary element, almost a residue, of this structure.

This is so because the abovementioned indeterminacy, when methodologically transposed to the interpretive treatment of legal materials (especially legal norms, rules, and precedents), operates in permanent tension with a pre-assumed notion of undecidability. If this combination prevents legal answers from being anticipated in any way, and judgments become walking spaces—intervals—for recreation of justice, such a recreation happens to grow from inside the formal limits of institutions, making its best effort to "fulfil" in concrete the human absences and meaninglessness of their prescriptions, exploring the necessary ambivalence of words and polarity of concepts, and possible breaches in language, in order to open law's normative world to other dimensions of human praxis and practical experience of humanity that legal authority would be naturally unable to foresee, with its necessarily distorted lenses.

In this Derridean-inspired conjoined disjunction (this "nested opposition" 14) between law and justice (this tension or "polarity" that nests in the heart of every word), whilst "the law" and legal decisions are always predictable, justice—as a verb and not a noun15—, as a field of singularity and difference, must remain open to a priori indeterminate possibilities of realization;16 it must remain indeterminate in such a way it cannot be the proper target for any theoretical effort. As is said about its counterpart, injustice, justice too exceeds concept, it "exceeds the theory of justice" (Douzinas and Gearey [2005,](#page-297-0) p. 30). It is dialogical, not dialectical; similar to transgressive musical performances, which "have always sought to challenge officialdom and patriarchal law by expanding the possible range of human expressiveness beyond what is accepted as the norm by society", justice represents the space for bringing to the surface and enable "alternative" experiences "[...] often considered to be deviant, abnormal or alien" according to the patterns fixed by "power elites" (Shaw [2018,](#page-299-0) p. 308). The affirmation of justice requires then the sensorial input provided by aisthēsis and the clarity before what is both changeable and singular (the glimpse of the case) provided by phronēsis, a relative combination between the Phrónimos' effort to unite past and present, and aesthetic gaze.

All this give rise to the image of a jurist, the judge—the third—placed inside the conflict, renouncing to law's objective and subjective condition of thirdness (tertialité), which interrupts "the order of the Face to Face" (Lévinas [1998,](#page-298-0) p. 105), to be assigned the role of a "participating subject" herself (Bakhtin [2017,](#page-297-0)

<sup>14</sup>In J. Balkin's synthesis, nested oppositions are "oppositions which also involve a relation of dependence, similarity, or containment between the opposed concepts" (Balkin [1990,](#page-297-0) p. 1671).

<sup>15</sup>"Perhaps justice itself is not an end but a means, not a goal or an outcome but an approach and an experience" (Manderson [2011](#page-298-0), p. 125).

<sup>16</sup>"The tension between justice as sameness and justice as difference, between law as calculation and justice as the incalculable, describes a predicament that is incapable of yielding to a choice, a compromise, a balance, or a synthesis" (Manderson [2012](#page-298-0), pp. 477, 491, 497-cit.).

p. 97-ff.). She must "compare" and "calculate" (as any act of judgement requires), but is also responsible (not just institutionally) for the equations made—almost as if she had a responsibility "without alibis" (Bakhtin [2017](#page-297-0), p. 99-ff.), for the responsibility without alibis is the one that is fulfilled, in Bakhtin's view, in a private sphere, by a directly participating subject in the domain of a directly participating life (a life of singularities), unlike the responsibility with alibis, which arises from participation in the whole, deals with social representations, is moulded by abstractions, and belongs to the public realm of society, culture, law and justice (Ponzio [2017,](#page-299-0) p. 17-ff.). Because of this, and because its requirements presuppose the normative "mediation" of a world-in-common—the world of intersubjectivity17—, this second kind of responsibility is always correlative and conditional (Neves [2008](#page-298-0), p. 15), and, so, necessarily guaranteed and limited both in its nature (its content) and in its extension—thus avoiding the sacrifice of the possibility of autonomy due to a "hypertrophy" of responsibility (Neves [1995,](#page-298-0) p. 416).

The aesthetic judge, on the other hand, as the aesthetic person in general, must uncover the cloak of officialdom and institution and attend directly to the call of the other, abdicating from the outwardness of a tertium comparationis that could in advance limit the possibilities of this encounter.18 Since ethical responsibility knows no intersubjective limits, and the legal system and the materials that comprise it are insufficient to satisfy the demands of such responsibility, the reciprocal positions of the party cannot be validly established, and there is, again, no third party to enable comparison (Bronze [2020,](#page-297-0) p. 344 (footnote 895)). Apart from the ethical appeal, there are no material juridical standards, grounds, or criteria, for tracing the chain of practical analogies that sustain comparability, as an extensive, demanding, and everrenewed exercise of juridical composition—poíēsis—that does not seek identity, but similarities in differences.19 In such an aesthetic gaze, law's capacity to forge its own vocabulary and codify reality (submitting the immediacy of time to the conditionality of a "second nature" created with the others) appears again in this methodological and interpretive context mainly as one plain secretion of formalism, and the

<sup>18</sup>Her role could be approached by analogy from that of "the lawyer and academic today", according to Douzinas, that is, "[t]o revive an aesthetic of justice, in the name of a justice whose judgments lie outside or beyond the law, expressions of a higher tribunal to which the law is called to account, when its eye turns into an ossifying gaze" (Douzinas [2011,](#page-297-0) p. 258).

<sup>19</sup>In the words of Bronze, "[é] a analogia que, qual fio de Ariadne, nos guia nas labirínticas e múltiplas encruzilhadas do 'mundo da vida'" (Bronze [2020,](#page-297-0) p. 225). The proximity between life and analogy is algo mentioned by Foucault, highlighting the contrast between the logic of similitudes, which presupposes maintaining the possibility of dissemblance and difference ("[l]'identitê des choses, le fait qu'elles peuvent ressembler aux autres ets approcher d'elles, mais sans s'y engloutir et en préservant leur singularité"), and, because of that, maintains the link between the words and the world, and the search for identity (of Cervantes, F. Bacon, and Descartes), "comparaison de la mesure et celle de l'ordre", which have had a huge impact "pour la pensée occidentale" and promotes an interruption of that connection, subjugating the world to the representational anxiety of language (Foucault [2005,](#page-298-0) pp. 33, 39–41, 57–58, 61–62, 64–68, 133).

appeals to law, in turn, once it is caricatured as formalism, are identified with a major anxiety for the convenient simplification of praxis, including the full sense of the persons who intervene in it, merely for the sake of institution and the "invisible" but blinding power that sustains it. Such a caricature creates the counter-image of humanity that gives body to the necessity of an aesthetic and ethical healing, the remembering of what the law can be once detached from the distortions of orthodox shadows, or already is, once such shadows are taken out of the way, emerges as a remedy much needed. But a reminder that "[l]aw remains, however, a deeply aesthetic practice", and that "[i]nstitutional image and fiction-making offers approved ways of seeing and recognising the world", giving a certain clarity to what is otherwise "blurred" (Douzinas [2011,](#page-297-0) pp. 256–257), does not have to lead to an a priori seeming difference between the legal world and the artistic-poietic imaginary.

If the legal world and experience can be much more than a bulk of institutions and pre-defined positivistic and formalist discourses and legacy, as the spirit of pluralism, transgression, and diversity of aesthetic arguments rightly proves, legal aesthetics can be more than a sophisticated attack on a localized view of the rule of law and the methods and rationality of "orthodox" legal thinking or, in some situations, its contemporaneous counterparts, instrumentalism, pragmatism, and technicism. When the legal system, on the one hand, and juridical controversy—the case—, on the other (the two cornerstones of the experience of law) (Neves [1993](#page-298-0), pp. 155–159), cease to be seen a priori as that formal structure and an ensemble of empirical "facts" moulded in positivistic method (unorganized "data" assembled by the jurist only to be logically subsumed into abstract legal materials20), or, even as two opposite, contradictory, dimensions (so that one of them would necessarily have to subsume into the other), they can be seen as two reciprocal, analogically/dialectically intertwined, referents (Bronze [2020,](#page-297-0) pp. 176–177), holding the jurist responsible for the art of building a network of possible relationships through which the corpus iuris gains its positive configuration and identity at each time. As a result, aesthetic arguments and devices cease to be a supplement to law and legal discourse and start to indicate a fundamental part of such an experience and culture, as an experience of jusaesthetics.

This, of course, presupposes the affirmation of a different image of law, an image of law as a pluralist and heterogenous, yet internally driven, project of normative validity (Linhares [2012a](#page-298-0), p. 497-ff.), civilisationally and culturally constructed around certain commitments and axiological foundations (principles) that, reinventing humanitas as a specific juridical image and practical artefact, amplifying law's conditions of visibility (asserting law as a particular experience of sightedness), far from being either mere premisses-ratio or simple unmediated

<sup>20</sup>"[...] [L]aw takes extraordinary measures to impose narrative certainty, meaning, and clarity on the sheer randomness and meaningless of the events, actions and interactions that litter human existence, and as such assume the existence of a literary necessity in everything that occurs" (Leiboff [2010](#page-298-0), p. 387).

<span id="page-297-0"></span>values-intentio, act, instead, as true groundings of juridical practice (Neves [1993,](#page-298-0) p. 156; Linhares [2012b,](#page-298-0) pp. 399–412).

Feeding on the inevitable and welcome human differences but looking to establish the possibility of juridical similarity within the variations, such a project manages to design, amidst the plurality, several rooms for subjectivity, and, with this, several chains and claims of intersubjectivity. A living world that keeps reinventing itself, at institutional level, to the extent it keeps on recreating the meaning and the limits of its own praxis, and the symbolic ethos (the juridicalpolitical shared imaginary) constituting the referred axiological-normative principles-compromises, claimed as those practical-normative foundations and guides, embodies the heterogeneous material unity of a permanently constituting juridical system—a pluridimensional corpus iuris permanently fed by such a praxis, projecting itself methodologically as the tertium comparationis of intersubjective relations and creating a "rhizomatic", kaleidoscopic net of possibilities (Neves [1993](#page-298-0), pp. 155–156; Bronze 2020, p. 181-ff.). This means a project and an experience of temporal validity in which law, both synchronically and diachronically, constitutes a "way of life" that only breathes through the necessarily redefining—both limiting and redeeming—presence of others (Duarte 2021, p. 22). And, as such, one which keeps submitting its own conditions of visibility to both dogmatic and metadogmatic self-reflected, but not self-centred, criticism.
