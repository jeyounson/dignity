Abstract It is well known that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights could only be written and agreed upon because their redactors first, and the ratifying states after, did abstract from the reasons why their agreed to the same content. Such a pluralism of reasons is an essential characteristic of international conventions and of democratic states. Rawls speaks here of an "overlapping consensus" on the conclusions of reasonings from premises that are in part different, belonging to different comprehensive doctrines. This applies in Rawls to human rights as part of the constitution as basic structure of a democratic state in his theory of justice.

Now there is a Hobbesian conception of the overlapping consensus as a mere modus vivendi that makes it possible for groups of people with an overlapping consensus on human rights to pursue their own good under conditions that are advantageous for them under the circumstances. Such is a prudential political conception. Rawls conception of the overlapping consensus on human rights is not prudential despite being political in the narrow sense, because he has a conception of political philosophy which does not imply universal validity. He thinks that human rights are grounded in public reason, not in universal philosophical reason.

Public reason is ethical reason with legal constraints, particularly the constraints imposed by the sources of law, the legislative procedure and the judicial process. But the legal constraints must be ethically justified, or they are objectionable and reasonings based on them disapproved by ethics. In this way public reason encompasses the differences between the various constitutional laws, as the reasonings developing them have in each case some different premises. But as such premises are at some point ethically validated or invalidated, the reasonings based on them are for the good or for the worst accounted for by ethics.

All human rights derive from the equal dignity of men, i.e., of their equal value as free and autonomous persons, who give themselves their own law. The democratic principle is the constitutional principle of a society on such an ethical basis.

Democratic reason is tantamount both to public reason and to legal reason in a modern constitutional state. It is a requirement of ethics but still not identical with

ethical reason, since it is possible to accept democratic reason and to argue against it from an ethical point of view. There is just one good way of reasoning, despite the constraints that the sources of law and the rules of procedure impose on legal reasoning, compared with ethics. Such constraints are based on the democratic principle, which is again based on ethical reason, which at last both grounds and limits the constraints that law imposes on reason.

Rawls theory of reflective equilibrium describes however the practice of practical syllogism guided by the Aristotelian virtue of the prudence (phronesis), which must be integrated by the acceptance of the equal value of human beings as a condition of the possibility of ethical reason. Rawls has therefore the philosophical instruments needed for a reinterpretation of his political philosophy as a true political philosophy as a part of philosophical ethics. Such an ethical reinterpretation does not impede but reinforces the overlapping consensus on human rights.

It will be difficult to find a moral philosopher who does not embrace the essential goods of human life that the human rights declared in international treaties and in state constitutions pretend to secure. I know of none. They disagree about the philosophical foundation of them and if there is one. Bentham was the first philosopher who wrote "a critical examination of the diverse declarations of rights of man and of citizen". He thought that such declarations, without an effective complete code of laws that establish the obligations that can secure the goods they pretend to achieve, are only means of anarchy and deception. They don't give real rights, only fake ones. Their addressees remain have-nots. If these behave according to them, they are a source of anarchy and revolution. If they behave according to the laws, they are means of deception. But Bentham would not object to a theory of human rights that seeks to bring into a system the corresponding obligations. He envisaged something of the sort when he wrote in his Project forme of the Civil Code: "it is true that as long as the principle of utility governs, there can be no obligations without rights [...]. So if under any principle, rights need obligations for their efficacy, under the principle of utility obligations must have rights as final cause."(U.C. XXXIII. 8c.)

It is well known that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights could only be written and agreed upon because their redactors first, and the ratifying states after, did abstract from the reasons why their agreed to the same content. I mean the agreement on the matter and not the agreement on the words, which might cover differences of interpretation. Such a pluralism of reasons is an essential characteristic of international conventions and of democratic states. Rawls speaks here of an "overlapping consensus" on the conclusions of reasonings from premises that are in part different, belonging to different comprehensive doctrines. This applies in Rawls theory of justice to human rights as part of the constitution as basic structure of a democratic state. According to Rawls it does not apply to the human rights established by international law, which is grounded simply in the agreement between states. His theory of justice is a political conception. that applies only to states. However, if we conceive international law as the law of the global society, there would be a global justice and it would apply to it.

Now there is a Hobbesian conception of the overlapping consensus as a mere modus vivendi that makes it possible for groups of people with an overlapping consensus on human rights to pursue their own good under conditions that are advantageous for them under the circumstances. Such is a prudential political conception.

Rawls conception of the overlapping consensus on human rights is not prudential, despite being political in the narrow sense, because he has a conception of political philosophy which does not imply universal validity. He thinks that human rights are grounded in public reason, not in universal philosophical reason. Public reason is a Kantian idea that Rawls develops with important differences from Kant. "Public reason"—he writes "is characteristic of a democratic people: it is the reason of its citizens, of those sharing the status of equal citizenship" (Rawls [1993,](#page-24-0) p. 213). It is easy to observe that Rawls cannot have in mind either the actually communicated reasons among the citizens of any democratic state in the actual process of collective decision making in that state, or the capacities exerted by those reasons. Those citizens will eventually reason and decide badly, because they have no good reason for the contents or the form of their reasoning. Besides they will always reason in a different manner than the citizens of any other democratic state. In fact, explains Rawls, public reason "as an ideal conception of citizenship for a constitutional democratic regime, presents how things might be, taking people as a just and wellordered society would encourage them to be" (Rawls [1993](#page-24-0), p. 213). But can or must the ideal of the citizens of one democratic state diverge from the ideal of the citizens of another one, given the different historical conditions and experiences, the political culture and the peculiar rules of the institutions in each state? Rawls says that he is inclined to think it can and to agree with Dahl (Dahl [1989,](#page-24-0) p. 192), that, for example, there is no unique and best universal way to solve the problem of how to protect the basic rights and interests. This is valid for this problem—which has to do with the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional court—and for similar questions regarding the political structure of the state. As for the specification of the basic rights and liberties, however, he doesn't admit variations, unless they are rather small. It seems, therefore, that the citizens of a democratic state are not really the authors but, after having been idealized, a criterion of public reason. They have to work out a public basis of justification that all citizens as reasonable and rational can endorse from within their own comprehensive doctrines. It is this condition of reasoned reflection that distinguishes public justification from mere agreement (Rawls [2001,](#page-24-0) p. 29).

Public reason is ethical reason with legal constraints, particularly the constraints imposed by the sources of law, the legislative procedure and the judicial process. But the legal constraints must be ethically justified, or they are objectionable and reasonings based on them disapproved by ethics. In this way public reason encompasses the differences between the various constitutional laws, as the reasonings developing them have in each case some different premises. But as such premises are at some point ethically validated or invalidated, the reasonings based on them are for the good or for the worst accounted for by ethics.

Democracy is a requirement of ethics in the law. The principle of human dignity is articulated in the values of liberty and equality and implies equal liberty for all citizens. From the equal ethical autonomy of men is derived the principle of the government of the people by the people. Equal liberty implies equal participation by all in the formation of the collective will, by means of equal rights to vote and to be elected and to have access to public offices and of the complementary liberties of expression, of information, of reunion and of association. Also, the principle of majority decision is implied, as the only way to give equal value to the free participation of each person in a decision which is binding for all.

If one requires less, than the members of the majority who are against the decision will be devalued. If one requires more, then the members of the majority who are in favour will be devalued only if the absence of decision will have the same effect as a contrary decision. If no such effect is present, then the requirement of qualified majority or of unanimity is compatible with equality, namely equality in the need of a certain level of consensus for obtaining a collective action. A majority decision is therefore an ethical requirement whenever a new decision is the result of collective action. It is the regular procedure for taking decisions by collective organs. The democratic principle would be denied if there were power which was not constituted and exercised by the people, even if such exercise were not more than indirect intervention of the elected representatives of the people by designating those entitled to power. This applies also to the designation of the judges of the constitutional court. They also derive their democratic legitimacy from universal suffrage, however indirectly, by means of the intervention of those directly elected in the designation of the judges.

Universal suffrage is therefore at the origin of all democratic decision, but it does not ensure the democratic character of a decision. Otherwise, all decisions by the people or by the organs designated by the people would be democratic, independently from their contents. The democratic character of a decision depends first on its direct or indirect acceptance by the majority, but it also depends on its conformity with the reasons on which the democratic principle is based, i.e., of democracy as a system of principles.

Democratic reason is tantamount both to public reason and to legal reason in a modern constitutional state. It is a requirement of ethics but still not identical with ethical reason, since it is possible to accept democratic reason and to argue against it from an ethical point of view. There is just one good way of reasoning, in spite of the constraints that the sources of law and the rules of procedure impose on legal reasoning, compared with ethics. Such constraints are based on the democratic principle, which is again based on ethical reason, which at last both grounds and limits the constraints that law imposes on reason.

The theory of justice of Rawls must be reinterpreted as a part of ethics, or it is an exercise of political rhetoric. The argument for a non-ethical but rhetorical interpretation of Rawls derives from a false interpretation of ethics as a deductive system. Rawls theory of reflective equilibrium describes however the practice of practical syllogism guided by the Aristotelian virtue of the prudence (phronesis), which must be integrated by the acceptance of the equal value of human beings as a condition of the possibility of ethical reason. Aristotle does not seek a general premise of every action—of the kind of the principle of utility—, which is the foundation of a body of rules like almost an axiomatic system. He is clearly aware of the difficulty to live a coherent life and to make compatible—or to prefer among—the diverse ends of practice, which have to be weighted in the deliberation giving cause to action (see Nicomachean Ethics, VI, 1139a 31–34). In fact, what is good for one end, can be bad for another. This is even true of the virtues, which have their siege in the character, and are habitual states or capacities also causing action: it is well known how the courage of Achilles was equally good for war and bad for piety. The same difficulty applies to the law. The only example that Aristotle gives of that part of the law that is determined by reason (and therefore natural to man) and not by convention, is the constitution of a rule of law state. He says that the laws are not everywhere the same, since constitutions also are not the same, though there is one that is everywhere by nature the best" (1135 a 3–5). Aristotle does not say here if there is only one best constitution everywhere or if everywhere there is one best constitution for such a place. However, the last interpretation fits best to his clear doctrine that natural (or rational) law is variable, as much as conventional law (1134b 24–33). Now, Aristotelian ethics is constructed similarly to life, with the logical difficulties of deliberation, proceeding from below and not from above.

Rawls, through his Aristotelian theory of the reflective equilibrium, has therefore the philosophical instruments needed for a reinterpretation of his political philosophy as a true political philosophy as a part of philosophical ethics. Such an ethical reinterpretation does not impede but reinforces the overlapping consensus on human rights.

All human rights derive from the equal dignity of men, i.e., of their equal value as free and autonomous persons, who give themselves their own law. I mean here legal human rights that are the content of constitutions and of international declarations of human rights. They are the result of collective deliberations about them, in accordance with the norms about sources of law recognized by the law applying agents. There is an overlapping consensus about them, in the sense of an ideal agreement of citizens that exert public reason. Public reason is here reinforced by ethical reason, or moral theory (as Rawls would say), because they are derived from human dignity, which is the first normative principle of ethics, as received by the law of a rule of law state. Derived does mean here only that human dignity is a necessary condition and therefore a premise of the rational justification of the right in question. There are other premises related with the collective historical experience of the good of man in the political community in question.
