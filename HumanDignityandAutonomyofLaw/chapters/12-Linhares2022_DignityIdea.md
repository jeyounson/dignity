# Is Dignity a Non-contingent Autonomously Juridical "Idea"? A Conversation Piece with Jeremy Waldron

José Manuel Aroso Linhares

Abstract "Dignity (...) is a principle of morality and a principle of law. (...) Dignity seems at home in law: law is its natural habitat. (...) [M]aybe morality has more to learn from law than vice versa." (Waldron). The conversation piece which follows endeavours to clarify this assumption, less however in order to reconstitute the "place" of dignity in Jeremy Waldron's conception of Law (as a decisive component of his defence of normative or ethical positivism and the corresponding justificatory aims) than to treat his well-known distinction between dignity as a ranking status (dignitas) and dignity as value or (absolute inner) worth (Würde) as a plausible reflexive resource or tool, which a non-positivist culturally contextualized experience of Law should advantageously mobilize (and assimilate) whilst developing a critical-archeologic reconstitution of a specific context of emergence and a corresponding argument of continuity (highlighting the institutionalization of controversy and respondere, if not audiatur et altera pars in Roman civitas as the beginning of a successful practical-cultural project). Considering the purposes of this reconstruction, the possibility of highlighting the invention of dignity as an endogenous legal idea (privileging a ranking status account) and the opportunity to consider a significant experience of transvaluation (putting dignity "to work in a new and egalitarian environment", precisely the one which Modernity and Enlightenment introduced) are certainly non-negligible resources.

Notwithstanding its subtitle, the essay which follows endeavours less a full-length accomplished dialogue with Jeremy Waldron's concept of Law than a transparent (and hopefully "productive") "misreading" 1 considering some of its components: as

if we were exploring the possibilities (and promises) of an argumentative displacement (or transposition)—deliberately affecting the integrating reflective horizon and in this sense acknowledging the self-sustaining relevance and transversality (if not sveltezza) of a specific conclusion-claim. In order to clarify this intention, it needs to be added that the reflective aim is not reconstituting the place (or the role) that a certain jurisprudence of dignity occupies (or plays) in Jeremy Waldron's conception—as an integrated component of his normative thesis about law and the normative (or ethical?) positivism which warrants it (Waldron [2001](#page-270-0)) 2 —, it is rather admitting that his well-known (severely discussed and often misunderstood) distinction between dignity as a ranking status (dignitas) and dignity as value or (absolute inner) worth (Würde) can be treated as an autonomous reflective resource or tool, which for instance a certain non-positivist (culturally contextualized) experience of Law (defending a practical-culturally conceived separation thesis between juridicity and morality) admits, advantageously mobilizes, and assimilates whilst developing a decisive argument of continuity (Linhares [2016,](#page-269-0) [2018](#page-269-0)). The counterpoint status or rank/worth or value allows us certainly to explore a constitutive opposition between semantic and pragmatic contents (and the corresponding performance contexts), it allows us also however to acknowledge diverse emergence conditions (sustaining different practical worlds), which means associating them with ideas (or even principles) which are said respectively originally legal and non-legal or extralegal ones (attributable to moral or religious world views or to political or social philosophy, as well as to literary experience or ethical interiorisation). The appropriation of this reflexive tool is all the more indispensable as, according to Waldron, the correspondent exercise of differentiation presupposes the recognition that, dignity being "a principle of law" and "a principle of morality" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 13), the juridically endogenous idea has here an undisputable priority or precedence,3 which very clearly means that, concerning dignity, "maybe morality has more to learn from law" ("including [from] the philosophical and normative part of jurisprudence") "than vice versa" (2015, pp. 14, 133).

<sup>2</sup> This normative (prescriptive, ethical or democratic) version of positivism (Waldron, Campbell) contrasts with a purely descriptive (conceptual or epistemological) version (Hart, Coleman) whilst assuming that positivism is less a theoretically (analytically) self-sufficient perspective than a position to be defended, "valued or encouraged (...) from a moral, social and political point of view". Concerning the plausible labels, whereas Campbell hesitates between the possibilities of "ethical" and "prescriptive positivism", Waldron prefers the expression normative positivism: "Unfortunately (...), that term has also been used in recent years to describe a different thesis namely, the version of legal positivism that identifies law with norms (as opposed to brute facts about power, commands, and sanctions). On this account, the theories of H. L. A. Hart and Hans Kelsen qualify as versions of normative positivism even if they are not in themselves normative positions. (...) The term 'ethical' seems [however] unsatisfactory to me. (...) In this paper I shall mostly use the label 'normative positivism', despite the possibility of confusion..." (Waldron [2001](#page-270-0), pp. 411–412).

<sup>3</sup> "[D]ignity need not be treated in the first instance as a moral idea" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 15), "[d] ignity seems at home in law: law is its natural habitat" (2015, p. 13), "dignity [is] an idea [which] law create[d]" (2015, pp. 13, 15).

### 1 Two Narrative "Accounts"

Allow me just two more words in order to recall the jurisprudence of dignity reconstituted by Waldron. If we already know that the core of this reconstitution explores a specific counterpoint, we now need to give privilege to its narrative intelligibility, which means opposing the "ranking status" accounts and the "absolute worth" accounts (with their indisputable affinities respectively to dignitas as a legal idea and worth or Würde as an extralegal one). Notwithstanding the complexity of the contents experienced (often escaping or falsifying the apparent linearity of these accounts and their expected paths), this narrative intelligibility is certain a productive one.

First of all, it allows us to access two incommensurable worlds of names and the role which they play in the effective organization of meanings. Whereas the constitutive reference in the signifier dignitas favours a clustering of rights and duties4 and thus unveils a chain of signifieds which include standing, ranking status and tradition, honour and noble bearing, deference, considerability, degree of estimation and respect, non-degradation, self-possession, self-control and auctoritas, but also potestas, hierarchy, positional privileges and haughtiness (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), pp. 4–6, 14, 18, 21–22, 30–33, 51 ff)—, to explore the signifier Würde ("fundamental worth or absolute inner worth, dignity as value [beyond price]") means in contrast giving privilege to the connotations of absolute worth, intrinsic value, non-fungibility, capacity for morality, autonomy, authenticity, sacredness or sanctity of life, if not directly to the Kingdom of Ends formula (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), pp. 6, 23 ff., 27–30, 137 ff.).

And yet, this narrative intelligibility does not condemn us to incommensurability. Quite the contrary, the counterpoint in question is designed by Waldron less in order to emphasize incommunicable differences, than as an opportunity to acknowledge that the first of these two accounts (whose reflective productivity the Author clearly favours) is (or has been) capable of preserving its autonomy and identity, whilst responding to diverse practical-cultural contexts and their institutionalization challenges, or more precisely and specifically, whilst responding to equality or egalitarian claims and the correlative demands of universalization (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 14)... and to these as components of performative contexts in which the second account (the "absolute worth" account)—through the universalist dynamics imposed by the decisive (albeit heterogeneous) influences of Roman-Catholic Teaching and modern and Enlightenment moral philosophy (culminating in Kant's arguments)—has become explicit (and apparently dominant). According to Waldron, this acknowledgment not only explains manifest conceptual contaminations—those which prevent the possibility of sustaining pure "worth accounts", treating dignity as a purely

<sup>4</sup> "Dignity as the ranking status [...] comprises a given set of rights, [...] that a person may occupy in society, display in his bearing and self-presentation, and exhibit in his speech and actions." (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), p. 28).

value-concept, entirely free from rank connotations5 —, but also and above all unveils a decisive cultural and institutional dynamics... and with this a significant experience of transvaluation—"[putting dignitas] to work in a new and egalitarian environment [or simply universalizing an] ethics of honor" (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), pp. 14, 26).

I believe that as far as dignity is concerned the connotation of ranking status remained, and that what happened was that it was transvalued rather than superseded. [...] The older [notion of rank] is not obliterated; it is precisely the resources of the older notion that are put to work in the new (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), pp. 31, 33)

It is the attention paid to this experience of transvaluation which finally allows the thesis (or the conclusion-claim) of equal dignity that we all know (and that Waldron has been treating as the basis of a promising work in progress): the one which defends that "the modern (and contemporary) notion of human dignity", whilst involving "an upwards equalization of rank" (2015, p. 33), "represents a sort of normative levelling-up to the treatment and respect that traditionally was due to those occupying the topmost rungs in society's hierarchy of status" (2015, pp. 143–144). As if we were trying "to accord to every human being something of (...) the expectation of respect that was formerly accorded to nobility" or as if we were organizing ourselves "not like a society without nobility or rank, but like an aristocratic society which has just one rank (and a pretty high rank at that) for all of us" (2015, p. 144).6

### 2 Developing the Promised "Misreading(s)"

Notwithstanding its undisputable vulnerability to misinterpretations, is this a productive thesis? I shall argue here that it is. The reasons I would like to invoke coincide however only very partially with those which Waldron has been exploring, whilst considering the implications of the status account to reinvent the problem of responsibility or the dialectics autonomy/responsibility—to understand for instance the tensions between choice and responsibility (or to warrant the role of duties), as well as rejecting the modern experience of autonomy, with its hypertrophy of a perspective of rights (2015, pp. 140–141)7 —... or whilst rethinking some of the

<sup>5</sup> Neither St Thomas Aquinas nor even Kant, notwithstanding his celebration of a "quasi-aesthetic ideal" (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), p. 25), would escape in fact these contaminations (2015, pp. 24–26, 28–30, 31 ff, 137–138).

<sup>6</sup> "[W]e can use aspects of the traditional meaning of dignity, associated with high or noble rank conceptions to cast light on our of human rights. [...] I think all this is tremendously helpful in deepening our talk of human dignity and enriching our understanding of rights. The idea that both notions are connected with ideas of status, and with the transvaluation of older notions of rank, is a stimulating one..." (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), pp. 34, 36).

<sup>7</sup> "[O]ur modern understanding of autonomy sees it almost entirely as a matter of right untinged by any sense of responsibility. Once upon a time, autonomy carried with it a sense of responsibility; but

apparent difficulties concerning human rights (2015, pp. 16–19)—opening up the chance to distinguish "dignity as a general status and the particular rules that protect and support it", as well as to defend the thesis that whereas "dignity is a normative status", "many human rights may be understood as incidents of that status" (2015, p. 18).8 The lack of coincidence is in fact easily understandable, not so much because the assimilation is a partial one (highlighting only some of the components at stake), but also because the argument it allows will be unequivocally integrated into an alternative conception of Law, requiring from now on a transparent (and hopefully productive) misreading exercise. As I have already anticipated, the alternative in question conceives of law and morality (or moralities) as specific ways of creating intersubjective meanings, generating unmistakably distinct practical worlds allowing (without paradox or unmotivated defiance) the identification of a nonpositivist separation thesis (Linhares [2016)](#page-269-0). This thesis requires in fact a full historical-cultural contextualization of law's answers, on one hand treating those answers (and the corresponding questions, as well as the acquisitions which stabilize them) as explicit cultural artefacts (significantly inscribed in the possibilities of the Western Text), and on the other hand giving their historical emergence and their continuity the intelligibility of an institutionalized way of life, if not the identity of a practical project-projecting—which in any case means considering a certain Law and this one seriously treated as a non-universal (culturally plausible and civilizationally moulded) response to the universal (anthropologically necessary) problem of the institutionalization of a social order. In its deliberately non-conventionalist idiom (privileging the claim to autonomy and the problem of limits), this is certainly only one of the possible views of the cathedral—a view which, following one of the most fruitful and challenging lessons of Castanheira Neves ([2008,](#page-270-0) pp. 9–41, 101–128), I have been persistently pursuing (2016, 2018, 2020). In what sense does however this view and the critical approach it demands assimilates Waldron thematization of dignity? I would say that we can consider three plausible contributions—all of them relatively unexpected (when we consider the reflexive legacies privileged by Waldron's conception) ... and as such all of them particularly significant (and providing unsuspected corroborations)...

## 2.1 Law and Moralities: An Indirect Contribution

I'll begin with the least specific of the three contributions, and I mean "least specific" because what is at stake here is not directly the content of dignity, but rather its origin and character, or more precisely, its "habitat" or "proper home" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0)

now it is just a matter of choice and freedom. It operates as an emancipating concept in a straightforward way in which dignity does not..." (Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), p. 140).

<sup>8</sup> See also (with a specific consideration of the problem of the assisted suicide) Waldron ([2017)](#page-270-0).

pp. 119,9 133–137), being certain that this issue and the assumptions it allows are taken seriously by Waldron as a step towards an unexpected global implication, concerning the counterpoint between legality and morality. Whilst maintaining that "dignity seems at home in law", that "law is its natural habitat", or that "dignity need not be treated in the first instance as a moral idea..."(2015, pp. 13, 15), Waldron opens up an explicit pathway to defending that there are authentic (endogenous) juridical grounding contents and that those contents demand an autonomous specific perspective (and an immanent critique, involving internally objectified standards), which means also explicitly rejecting the need to treat every reflection concerning juridical aspirations, claims and demands or every reflection concerning legally institutionalized contents in the perspective of their worthiness, soundness or correctness as an unavoidably "moral" reflection (as if we were condemned to an exercise in moral thought).

After all it is not just surface-level rules which are legal in character (as though anything "deeper" must be moral). I follow Ronald Dworkin in believing that grounding doctrines can be legal too—legal principles, for example, or legal policies. Law creates, contains, envelops and constitutes these ideas. It does not just borrow them from morality (2015, p. 15).10

Regarding the framework (the thematic limits and the answer possibilities) of a certain familiar Anglo-Saxon debate between positivists and non-positivists (with their array of separation, separability and non-separation theses)—a framework which, aggravated through the a-cultural (and in this sense allegedly universal) configuration of the proposed answers, has already contaminated the legal theoretical debate much beyond its "natural" frontiers (producing more confusion than clarification) ...—regarding this debate and its expansive pathos, I repeat, Waldron's conclusions are in fact not only surprising but also precious.11 All the more precious, I dare say, when the conception of Law which assimilates them (which mobilizes them as unsuspected resource) defends (not only beyond Waldron... but also already against Waldron) a fully practical-cultural treatment of Law's aspirations (re-thinking law's constitutive cultural-civilisational originarium in a limit-situation such as our own). One of the cornerstones of this conception (in the way I defend it)

<sup>9</sup> This page, with the formulation "proper home", concerns Wai Chee Dimock's commentary ("High and Low").

<sup>10</sup>"[A] lot of what we call moral thought is not devoted to the establishment of a moral order analogous to a legal order, but is in fact oriented to the evaluation and criticism of the legal order itself. Political morality is about law, and so the place of dignity in political morality orients itself critically to the place of dignity in legal system. What I have been arguing is that a lot of this moralizing involves immanent critique, rather than bringing standards to bear that are independent of those the law itself embodies. We evaluate law morally using (something like) law's very own dignitarian resources" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 67).

<sup>11</sup>To corroborate this, it suffices to recall Michael Rosen's negative reaction in his commentary "Dignity Past and Present" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) pp. 79–98), considering Waldron's defence of a juridically "endogenous" class of concepts as an "intriguing and ambitious claim" (Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 83). "I doubt that there are such purely legal foundational ideas, but, if there are, then (...) dignity is not one" (Ibid.).

is precisely the invoked separation thesis between law and morality: an approach that does not exclude convergences, and overlaps between law and moralities moralities which may range from positive conventional substantive morality or ethicity (consecrating the particularism of mores and traditions) to a critical (tendentially universal and procedural) political morality (celebrating the culturalneutral quality of modern or Enlightenment acquisitions)12—, but which treats them as distinct languages or different sets of "occasions" for the "creation of meaning" (if not as practical-existential resources), with different leading problems and unmistakably distinct understandings of communitarian validity (determining, as such, experiences and concepts of autonomy and responsibility that are not to be reciprocally confounded). With this conclusion: if we are allowed to speak of ethics (or rather of an ethical dimension) as a constitutive feature of the quest for the law—if we want, with Fuller, to persist in identifying the "morality that makes law possible" (Fuller [1969,](#page-269-0) pp. 33 ff.)—it is certainly not in order to understand the incorporation of the current dominant social morality (in a particularistic communitarian vein) or to conclude that moral correctness (universally and procedurally experienced) is a condition for legal validity (Alexy [2010)](#page-269-0), just as it is certainly not to require that legal forms of argument incorporate (albeit with limits) the warrants and criteria of philosophical ethics (Brito [2011)](#page-269-0). It is instead (following Fuller's claim but no longer his answer!) in order to identify a specific internal way of conceiving and experiencing humanitas and phronêsis, which is certainly not universal but culturally and civilisationally constructed—a way of constructingperforming communitarian meaning, whose continuity and punctuality should be permanently (heatedly and even radically) discussed, whose richness and fragility as a plausible collocutor, between other decisive collocutors, is derived precisely from this identity.

## 2.2 Two Direct Contributions

Waldron's reconstitution of "jurisprudence of dignity" offers however two other (this time significantly) direct contributions, which, from the perspective which I defend, can be productively mobilized in the critical discussion on Law's cultural

<sup>12</sup>In the words of Habermas (distinguishing between procedural morality and substantive ethicity), but also (simultaneously!) in the words of Hart and Waldron (underlining-clarifying a distinction which was introduced by Austin and made habitual through the dialogue with utilitarianism). See Habermas [(1991](#page-269-0)), p. 100 ff., Hart [(1963](#page-269-0)), pp. 17–24 ("Positive and Critical Morality") ["... "positive morality" [as] the morality actually accepted and shared by a given social group..."/ "..."critical morality" [referring to] the general moral principles used in the criticism of actual social institutions including positive morality..." (p. 20)], Waldron [(1989)](#page-270-0) ["the moral culture of a particular community [as a] (...) body of distinctive mores, norms, and standards / a critical [reflective] (...) general account of what a society must be like if it is to accommodate the sort of beings we are..." (Ibid., pp. 561, 562, 563, 582, 587).

project. As the intention is considering a certain law, with a rigorously located context of emergence—taking us back to the second century B.C., i.e. to the institutionalization of controversy and respondere (if not audiatur et altera pars) in Roman civitas (decisively strengthened by the reception of Hermagoras' rhetoric)—, one of the indispensable issues to be taken into account is precisely a reconstitution of this context (a reconstitution which may be able to assume the identity of a critical archaeological reflection and with it a deliberate interpellation of our present experience): the invention of dignity as an endogenous legal idea (privileging a ranking status account) is certainly a non-negligible resource in this reconstruction [Sect. 2.2.1]. The other issue has to do with a positive argument of continuity and change and the experience of constitutive historicity it allows: here is the aforementioned transvaluation thesis (celebrating the intertwinement between the dominant ranking account and the challenges of an egalitarian environment) which proves its mettle as a felicitous contribution [Sect. [2.2.2](#page-265-0)]. A brief allusion must suffice now to distinguish these two steps and highlight the abovementioned assimilation.

#### 2.2.1 Law's Context of Emergence

Starting with the context of emergence, we could say that the core issue here at stake concerns the successful autonomy of Law's practical-cultural project. Which specific differentiation practices allow us to attribute the full invention of its way of life (or the corresponding claim) to Roman civitas' experience of "isolation" and the corresponding "rise of the jurists" (Stein [2007,](#page-270-0) pp. 4 ff.)? I would say that this is the decisive question. More than reproducing Schulz's famous diagnosis or exploring the historical experience which this diagnosis highlights (Schulz [1936,](#page-270-0) III, pp. 19 ff.), the challenge at stake (from the perspective which our contemporary circumstances demand) is rather to discuss the perplexities and misunderstandings that its signifier creates.13 The isolation that interests us today when we consider the republican "rise" of the secular "jurists" (the iurisconsulti or prudentes, who replaced the pontiffs)—and its "fine sense of the limitations of the law" (Schulz [1936,](#page-270-0) p. 22)—in fact corresponds less to the reflexive axis deliberately explored by Schulz—circumscribing grounds, territories or realms under the perspective of rules or groups of rules, which are said to be legal and extra-legal (religious, moral and consuetudinary) rules (Schulz [1936](#page-270-0), p. 28)—than to the invention of a specific problem of inter-subjectivity or comparability that is different from all the others and as such justifies the emergence of an entirely new practice of respondere and this one as a distinctive specification of phronesis.

<sup>13</sup>See exemplarily B. W. Frier [(1985](#page-269-0)), pp. 184 ff. ("Jurists View the Law: the Ambiguities of "Autonomous Law")

As we know, the narrative developed by Schulz attributes to responsa prudentium—"juristic opinions, delivered piecemeal, usually in actual cases", 14 highlighted by auctoritas, albeit deprived of formal potestas or imperium—the persuasive "art of analysis", which, ignoring the "genetic connection between law and extra-legal matters" (such as political-economic conditions), as well as abstracting itself from (silencing) the real restrictions arising out of the so-called officium, 15 if not, in synthesis, cultivating an a-teleological formalism avant la lettre, made possible the separation or division between sacred and profane law, ius publicum and ius privatum, peregrine law and civitas' law (Schulz [1936](#page-270-0), pp. 26–34). This is a separation or division which (through the "ability" of "isolation" as "severance", i.e. a strict keeping apart), gave ius (if not juridicalness) the nuclear (paradigmatic) identity of a secular internal private (even though simultaneously substantive and procedural) order, based on an authentic ratio iuris and, as such, experiencing an untouchable natural "definiteness", if not definitiveness, corresponding to a "law of Nature" (Schulz [1936,](#page-270-0) pp. 34–36). Even without questioning the accuracy of the informative resources revealed by this narrative, we must, however, acknowledge that the narrative as such and/or the diagnosis it establishes are significantly situated (exemplarily dated), exposing us a-problematically, with the expected contribution of Jhering (Schulz [1936,](#page-270-0) pp. 37–38), to an understanding of Roman isolation, either of law or legal discourse [von Jhering [1883,](#page-270-0) pp. 560–674 (§§ 47- 47d : "Analyse des römischen Formenwesens"], which treats it as a forerunner of nineteenth century normativism in general and Naturhistorische Methode in particular, with the coherent reduction of legal thinking to epistemic resources.16 The critical denouncing of this unilateral back projection—and the awareness of the pre-judgements and affinities which construct it—do not however necessarily impose the rejection of the isolation thesis and the corresponding claim to autonomy.17 On the contrary, this questioning may actually pave the way towards reinterpreting this isolation and give it a different meaning (compatible, as we shall see, with what may be called a plausible argument of continuity). In avoiding the misconception which reduces the claim to autonomy to its formalistic intelligibility, the approach I propose displaces the relevant

<sup>14</sup>"[Only] occasionally in hypothetical cases" (Stein [2007,](#page-270-0) p. 5).

<sup>15</sup>This reference has to do with the ensemble of customary and moral canons which, invoking pietas, fides or reverentia for example, were or had been determinant factors in the establishment of certain material solutions and in the consecration of specific formulas: Schulz ([1936)](#page-270-0), pp. 20–24.

<sup>16</sup>This reduction to epistemic resources, even though mobilizing a radically different understanding of episteme (inspired by Bachelard's constructivisme and absorving the philosophical problem of Law's foundations), affects also the very stimulating reconstitution of the Roman origins which we owe to Cyril Sintez (Sintez [2014)](#page-270-0).

<sup>17</sup>Such as the one which we may acknowledge in G.J. J. van den Bergh [(2005](#page-270-0)): "In the heyday of legal positivism the isolation of law was also projected back in history, as is inevitable. According to Schulz, it was the Romans - who else - who succeeded for the first time in isolating law from all that is not law. (...) In retrospect, this seems an absurd thesis What Schulz, on the authority of Jhering, presented as history was nothing else than nineteenth century bourgeois ideology..."

perspective from the norms and the realms or boundaries that their hypothetical types define (in their relatively self-sufficient and abstractly conceived macroscopic point of view) to the experience of practical controversy (juridically filtered as a caseartefact) and to the corresponding institutionalization of a microscopic model of community, involving two subject-parties and an impartial third (Giuliani [1966)](#page-269-0). The opportunity to create distinct communitarian meaning comes directly and immediately from the condition of possibility which, in constituting and relating the subject-parties, gives them the performative identity of positions (to be occupied) or masks (to be buckled). I refer, obviously, to the condition which, by institutionalizing the opportunity (if not also the legitimacy) to claim different (contrasting) understandings of the shared situation-event and the common context-order (with the corresponding warrants-topoi), construct-conform these differences and the issues they explore (as sources of plausible arguments) as intrinsically compatible with a (real or virtual) practical-prudential treatment or judicative assimilation. The core of the introduced communitas-artefact corresponds actually to this possibility of treatment or assimilation or, more precisely, to a certain located invention of a tertium comparationis, which is (or should be) institutionalized through the possibility of the participation of a third (impartial) subject. It is, in fact, as if the face-à-face immediately experienced in the subject's encounter should be conventionally submitted to a constitutive interruption, i.e. to a thematization of intersubjectivity which, without paradox, generates a new kind of intersubjectivity. It is this intersubjectivity, specified as an authentic attributive bilaterality (Reale [1982,](#page-270-0) chapter XLV, pp. 681–694), which, whilst relativizing the subjects, makes them effectively comparable: on the one hand by imposing a reciprocally constitutive connection between spheres of autonomy and responsibility (spheres which will be, in later stages, normatively and dogmatically specified as webs of rights and duties) and, on the other hand, by supporting a relevance filter which, considering the shared situation-event, distinguishes concreteness from singularity, i.e. an analogically comparable concreteness from pure, unconditional and absolute singularity (Linhares [2013,](#page-269-0) [2020](#page-270-0)). The result is a specification of phronêsis, if not a response to the challenge of ensuring that the new and the particular (corresponding to the problematic nucleus) may, in circular fashion (and inextricably), become the general and the old (Bubner [1990,](#page-269-0) p. 64). It is a specification which, invoking an authentic context-order—identified with ius quod est and its interpretative reconstruction in iurisprudenti's sentences—refuses, on the one hand, the possibility of a respondere which may appear as a self-sufficient (causa sui) expression of an inspired voluntas (as in the case of the pontiffs' responses) and, on the other hand, frees judicial rhetoric from the holistic continuum that the Aristotelian emancipation (secularization) of praxis-phronesis constitutively preserved, as well as from its strict reference to the past. The construction of a claim to autonomy seems, in fact, inseparable from this change of emphasis concerning the temporal dimension, not because the reference to the past loses its relevance—without the reconstitution of what really happened (in the words of Jackson, "the story in the trial") there would be no possible answer to the indispensable status coniecturalis and the interrogation "an sit?"—, but rather because this reference henceforth appears organically integrated (as the "story of the trial") in the present of the controversy, as a necessary condition of the render-tribuere (ius suum cuique tribuere) which, as a judgement, appeases the parties' claims (Jackson [1988](#page-269-0)). However, this specification of phronêsis would not be identifiable if it represented less of a specification of humanitas, a word invented in this context18 to translate the consecration of a community of comparable equals,19 namely a community which the Roman Republic could only conceive of as an implacably circumscribed circle (overlapping an explicit status civitatis and the munus of paterfamilias), the intentional meaning of which represents however a remarkable acquisition, opening up the way to a specific institutionalization of audiatur et altera pars and thus to the consecration of a pragmatic of respect (considered as a source of normative claims).

Should this pragmatic of respect and its claim for equality (as a microscopic claim inseparable from the structure of controversy and from the possibility of a rational prudential comparability) be treated as a specification of human dignity? I would say it should ... and it is precisely here that the assimilation of Jeremy Waldron's "ranking status account" becomes manifestly rewarding: not only because this account highlights the internal connections between dignitas and the forms and procedures of law, but also because, when considering the "life of law", it explores the articulation between self-control (when ordinary people have "the dignity of judges") and public hearings ("in cases where an official determination is necessary") [Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) pp. 53–5420] It is this stimulating dialogue which allows me to add that, on account of the significance attributed to a microscopically experienced thirdness—granted by the adjudicator-third and the presupposition of jus (as a tertium comparationis of warrants, canons and rules)—, this is exactly the specification of human dignity which Law's cultural project invented as its own (even though in its initial consecration this meant exploring an implacably closed circle of inter-subjectivity) and which has been continuously pursued and permanently reinvented (not merely expanded within its own circle!) as an indispensable identifying claim (dignity as rank and status as an "intrinsic", non-contingent, "legal idea"), and also as a persistent component of a specific validity order.

I want to talk about a less obvious way in which law protects dignity, but a way that is deeper, more pervasive, and more intimately connected with the very nature of law. (...) [D] ignity has to function as a normative idea: it is the idea of a certain status that ought to be accredited to all persons and taken seriously in the way they are ruled. (...) When you hear my definition, the sense in which law inherently promotes dignity begins to become apparent. For it is easy to get the impression from the way I set this out of a person appearing in their own behalf before a public tribunal (say) and demanding to be listened to, demanding indeed that their view of things be taken account of before any public decision is made (for example, any public decision about what is to be done with them). This is evidently a legal

<span id="page-265-0"></span>idea, and it is arguably non-contingently so – in the sense that it is not a matter of the law-maker having just decided to promote dignity (in the way that the framers of Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions decided to promote dignity). Dignity seems to hook up in obvious ways with juridical ideas about hearings and due process and status to sue (Waldron [2012,](#page-270-0) pp. 4–5).

a The pragmatic at stake and the relativizing mask (which this pragmatic consecrates) are, as a matter of fact, inseparable from the principle of audiatur et altera pars and as such represent the invention of an autonomous and responsible subject the inter-subjectively relativized subject who, (implicitly or explicitly), invoking an order of warrants and criteria, addresses himself simultaneously to the other party and to the impartial third, demanding a hearing, as well as expecting a rationally judicative treatment of the controversy (Linhares [2012)](#page-269-0). Experiencing this isolation (and its legacy) by giving priority to the microscopic invention of intersubjectivity whilst attributing the intelligibility of a contextual resource to the concentration on private secular internal normativity—is certainly indispensable to defining a clearer counterpoint between Greek and Roman understandings of law and its dimensions. The holistic view diagnosed by Schulz as a kind of natural difficulty in disentangling law from the communitarian ethos (Schulz [1936,](#page-270-0) pp. 20–21) acquires a completely different, transparent meaning when we understand that the representation of juridicalness enabled the Greek experience to remain inseparable from a philosophy of justice and the contemplation (through the intellectual virtue of sophia) of cosmic being that was read (interpreted) as a presupposed, definitive, perfect order. We may, in fact, add that this juridical relevance (brilliantly opening up the path to the future juris naturalis scientia) corresponds to an undifferentiated normative projection of the harmony which such an order (in its essential totality) immanently claims—as if juridicalness should assume the identity of a global nomos incorporated (when not diluted) into the metaphysic of the logos (Neves [1983,](#page-270-0) pp. 492–506). Everything changed with the rise of the Roman jurists in the second century B.C., helped decisively by a certain Hellenistic fire of Prometheus that was not due to philosophical reflection but to Hermagorei and stasis doctrine [Giuliani [1961](#page-269-0), III, pp. 71–111 ("L'influsso della retorica sulle teoria del processo romano")]: the unavailability of the order was no longer attributed to a self-sufficient (abstract) Natural Law but to a cosmos of hypostasized institutions (un mondo a parte, il cosmo delle istituzione ipostatizzate, dei rapport "calculabili"), a cosmos which one may recognize (with the mediation of a substantialized typology involving sapientia and prudentia) when assuming a kind of metaphysic of being addressed to the concrete just—in the certainty that this experience of juridicalness adds to the philosophical dimension the decisive experience of an autonomization of jurisprudentia as praxis (Lombardi [1967](#page-270-0), p. 31).

### 2.2.2 The Argument of Continuity and the Transvaluation Thesis

What about the challenge concerning the positive argument for continuity? The problem concerns still the reasons which enable us to reconstitute the invention of controversy in republican civitas as a decisive beginning, but the question is now another one. We are very directly asking why (and in what sense) this artefact (or ensemble of artefacts), in terms of its development processes, merits (in the present context) the practical-cultural identity of a project-projecting (proicere). The knotty point lies in the formulation projecting (explicitly borrowed from Heidegger's understanding of constitutive historicity) or, alternatively, in the way the signifier projecting (mobilizing explicit signifiers justified by an experience of Geworfenheit-thrownness) identifies the development of a practical-cultural autonomous circle as a simultaneous experience of throwing and being thrown (in his own throw), with the coherent refusal of necessity and contingence [Heidegger [1947,](#page-269-0) p. 25, ([1927](#page-269-0)) 2001, §§ 31 and 63, pp. 142–148, 310–316]. Considered as a permanent constitutive tension between continuity and change—involving a communitarian self-availability which is simultaneously and inextricably selftranscendentality—this projecting refuses the pre-determined nature of a plan (in the ontic or ontic-teleological pre-modern sense of a universal a-historical order of excellences), as well as rejecting the identity of a programme (in the contingent-pragmatic sense which modern Zweckrationalität self-sufficiently justifies).21 It is as if the identity of law as a cultural artefact and the corresponding claim to autonomy should be reconstituted (in our ongoing effort to reconsider Western heritage and its present patrimony), whilst admitting that some major signs or traces recognizable in the initial step—the consecration of dignity of status as comparability and the institutionalization of audiatur et altera pars as a specification of a subjective and objective tertiality—persist as more or less explicitly constitutive features of identity in the subsequent trajectory, albeit permanently recreated and transformed (and as such inscribed-immersed in a productive circle of construction, reproduction and realization).

Whilst corroborating the conclusion-claim of plausible arguments for continuity, this conjugation of signs and features of identity is not, however, reducible to a closed "set of characteristics" which every practice or manifestation of Western law, in an all or nothing approach, would have to exhibit in order to count as such. Treating the development of identifiable practical-cultural practices (claiming autonomy and coherence) as the deployment of a project also means primarily arguing that the specificity of these practices and their experiences of continuity are not compatible with the claims of determinability and enclosure that class concepts warrant. In admitting that the European practical-cultural experience of law may be productively understood as a concept (and it is not certain that it is or should be!), the concept in question is certainly not a class concept but an archetypal or aspirational one, in which past or present expressions of the corresponding way of life (in the light of

<sup>21</sup>In the words of Heidegger, referring to the pre-modern sense, "[d]as Entwerfen hat nichts zu tun mit einem Sichverhalten zu einem ausgedachten Plan, gemäß dem das Dasein sein Sein einrichtet, sondern als Dasein hat es sich je schon entworfen und ist, solange es ist, entwerfend" [Heidegger [(1927)](#page-269-0) 2001, p. 145].

present rewriting) occupy different degrees of "approximation". 22 Whilst clarifying that the archetyps in question highlight culturally specific processes of quest or search (and the corresponding experiences of indispensability)—identifying the claim for an order of validity (involving a community of autonomous and responsible relativized subject-persons)—, we may, in fact, add that the features mobilized have in fact less to do with characteristics than with guiding intentions or constitutive aspirations or promises (if not desiderata), "by reference to" which these past or present expressions and their institutional instances should permanently be "judged" (Simmonds [2007](#page-270-0), p. 52).

With regard to this judgement and the legacy of constitutive intentions which guides it, it is, however, relevant to clarify that recognizing a trans-contextual persistence (which justifies the plausibility of an argument for continuity) does not mean postulating (or at least consecrating) a kind of immunity or resistance to historical contextualization. On the contrary, it means arguing that a critical-reflexive deciphering of the persistent signs or traces (and their aspirational potential) is best understood in terms of their indispensable present task when we attribute the role of specific (recognizable) mediators to these guiding intentions or aspirations, whose practices, fully immersed in unrepeatable "material" realities, articulate different "social-institutional" and "cultural-spiritual" (or "cultural-ideological") factors or dimensions and the corresponding contexts of signification and realization, together with the diverse problems and solutions they generate (Neves [1976](#page-270-0), p. 170). This assimilation of projecting as throwing and being thrown in fact enables us to understand how the reference to the same legacy (in its aspirational identity) generates unequivocally opposed modes of equilibrium or solutions for integration in different historical cycles (as well as in different institutional environments or in different tentative interpretations).23 It also enables us to understand why the criticalreflexive deciphering of continuity should simultaneously (and without paradox) be conceived of as an exploration of difference (although not necessarily différance). It is precisely as an eloquent example of these dynamics that the narrative proposed by Waldron concerning the transvaluation of dignitas (a transvaluation which preserves the connotation of ranking status, although putting it to work in a new egalitarian environment) should be productively assimilated. This means admitting a criticalreflexive approach distributing the two accounts of dignity: a distribution which treats the ranking account (as the institutionalization of comparability and tertialité) as a key component of Law's cultural project (translated in the so-called argument of continuity)... but also a distribution which identifies the philosophical, ethical and political worth account (with its claims to rational universality) as a key component

<sup>22</sup>The counterpoint between class concepts and archetypal or aspirational ones is developed by Nigel Simmonds ([2007)](#page-270-0), pp. 51–56.

<sup>23</sup>The opposed understandings of homo institutionalis (experiencing the priority of a transcendent communitas) and natural "unlinked" subject-individual (treating societas as an immanent artefactum) are for example both compatible (even though with different modes of equilibrium) with the archetype homo humanus and the consecration of dignity of status as comparability (in its aspirational identity).

of a certain specific environment (definitively established from the Modern and Enlightenment turn onwards). This emphasis certainly does not exclude the acknowledgement that the political-philosophical and moral idea of dignity as value, autonomously introduced in the modern cycle (the culminating canonic expression of which is certainly Kantian Menschenwürde) has not been assimilated into law's practical world: it has (translated into an immediate claim of equality), first of all formally, due to a decisive understanding of statute law as norm (as the Rousseaunian loi encore à faire, constitutively identified with an intrinsic expression of rational universality), then substantively, following a progressive (more or less contingent) conformation of the proposed legal-politic prescriptive solutions (and the corresponding justification). The normative dimension or level in which these claims to equality are incorporated (macroscopically referred to as a self-sufficient or, at least, autonomously conceived context-order, even when predominantly understood as a system of individual rights) is, however, significantly different from the normative dimension or level (intrinsically related to the problem-case) in which the said microscopic pragmatic and its experience of dignity (albeit in some historical cycles significantly hidden or apparently reduced to a subordinate place) grows and has been growing since Roman civitas's stage. Is this a productive distribution? I would say it is. In defending the accuracy of an understanding of law's continuity as a cultural project and as a constitutive process of reinvention and growth—emphasizing that this process of institutionalization (of a specific order of inter-subjectivity) is irreducible to a mere "expanding circle view", or at least that it should be experienced without the pathos of progress or the providentialist teleology24 which, by giving it an acultural conformation, misunderstands this expansion—this approach allows us in fact to experience the constitutive dialectics between the endogenous components of Law's project and the contextual and environmental conditions and resources which feed its performance.25 It is this dialectics which allows us to recognise that in our present historical cycle (as one

<sup>24</sup>The formula is by Michael Rosen ("Dignity Past and Present", in Waldron [2015](#page-270-0), p. 80).

<sup>25</sup>To understand the argument of continuity (and the productive intertwinement that this argument attributes to the different historical cycles), it is in fact essential to allude to the outlines of a certain dialectical counterpoint. This is the counterpoint which emerges when we distinguish the core of Law's project—identified as a continuous attempt to institutionalize a specific kind of intersubjectivity (between relativized, comparable and limited spheres of autonomy and responsibility and the corresponding masks of subjects-persons)—from the different cultural, political and economic environments in which this tentative institutionalization has been (and continues to be) pursued and where we may recognize a situated context of questions and problems (conditioning the criteria and the balance of comparability, whilst still able to identify the autonomous sense of "this" specific comparability as an unmistakable task of ius suum cuique tribuere). Defending this argument of continuity means, in fact, concluding that, even though the heritage of modern societas should undoubtedly be qualified as a dimension of the institutional environment of our present quest for law (with decisive acquisitions such as rule of law, human rights, separation of powers, exclusion of arbitrariness, social certainty, tolerance, respect, solidarity, protection against violence, freedom from want), we should equally be able to argue that Law's cultural project (in its practical identity) is irreducible to this environment. This evidently means avoiding the shortcomings of all answers which reduce Law's cultural project to one of its major cycles (or which at least consider that the

<span id="page-269-0"></span>of those acquisitions that we assume and consecrate as an irrevocable one), the ranking account involving audiatur et altera pars and tertiality will identify a legal order only if the quality of sui juris is universally attributed ("as the status of someone who can demand to be heard and taken into account") [Waldron [2015,](#page-270-0) p. 60]: or to say it in Waldron's words, only if we abandon the idea behind sortal status ("the idea that there are different kinds of person") [2015, pp. 58–59] and celebrate an "idea of law" or "of a legal system" embodying as a necessary condition "the assumption that everyone in a society ruled by law is treated as sui juris" (i.e. "as having full legal dignity") [Waldron [2012](#page-270-0), p. 17]. This is not in fact a simple expansion of the circle: it is a significant constitutive transvaluation of the demands and desiderata which highlight Law's project. As I have said, a remarkable example of the dialectics between constitutive aspirations and contextual or environmental resources.
