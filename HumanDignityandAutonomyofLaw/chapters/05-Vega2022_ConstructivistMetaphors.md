Abstract This essay explores the implications of two well-known metaphors introduced by Ronald Dworkin and Carlos S. Nino: the "chain novel" and the "construction of cathedrals". They are constructivist and practical metaphors that can be considered emblematic of the post-positivist conception of law. As such, they challenge the nuclear thesis of legal positivism: the value-free neutrality of law. This thesis implies that the legal domain is institutionally separated from morality and politics as a necessary condition for the autonomy of law. What is here defended is that the specific constructivist approach adopted by post-positivist theories offers, on the contrary, a better reconstruction of the idea that law has well-differentiated institutional limits. These limits are not denied by post-positivism, but rather redefined in a more complex and accurate way. Far from being limits merely "given" by rules, they rather result from the connection between these rules and some substantive values, a connection which is produced precisely by the intermediation of legal practice. This is the fundamental idea highlighted by the metaphors in comment and what makes the constructive element that emerges out of them particularly relevant.

### 1 Introduction

This paper explores some philosophical implications of two suggestive, well-known metaphors introduced by Ronald Dworkin and Carlos S. Nino: the "chain novel" and the "construction of cathedrals". Both metaphors brilliantly illustrate central points of their respective theories of law. Two main features stand out in them: they are,

first, practical metaphors and, second, constructivist metaphors. Both features can be considered emblematic of the post-positivist conception of law, a conception that has impacted in a strongly critical way, along the last decades, on the conceptual framework of legal positivism, which in turn is rather a basically structural and descriptivist conception of law. In particular, such critical impact decisively affects the positivist understanding of the autonomy of law, that is, of the limits or demarcation of the legal domain.

The nuclear thesis of legal positivism is the value-free neutrality of law. This thesis is projected in different but convergent ways in the three well-known sub-thesis: the separation (or separability) between law and morality, the social and the discretion thesis. According to this perspective, any conception of law that puts into question the neutrality thesis—like post-positivism and, before, natural law theories—should lead in an indefectible way to outright challenge the autonomy of law. Especially if in addition such a conception defends that for the law is intrinsic to maintain relations of a constructive nature with the practical surrounding spheres of morality and politics. For, according to legal positivism, the autonomy of law could only be ensured by strengthening the idea (or ideal) that the legal domain is an institutionally closed and isolated system of norms, rather than by weakening its borders with respect to morality and politics. Otherwise, the law would no longer make any "practical difference" in relation to those other normative spheres.

What is here defended is that legal post-positivism in no way poses such a threat to the autonomy of law. The specific constructivist approach adopted by postpositivist theories offers, on the contrary, a better reconstruction of the idea that law has well-differentiated institutional limits. These limits are not denied by postpositivism, but rather redefined in a more complex and accurate way. They are not merely limits "given" by rules but rather resultant from the connection between these and some substantive values, a connection which is produced precisely by the intermediation of legal practice. This is the fundamental idea highlighted by the above mentioned metaphors and what makes the constructive element that emerges out of them particularly relevant. This element has closely to do with the "technical" and "instrumental" dimension of legal rules and institutions with respect to those values.

Constructive metaphors, however, belong to a very long tradition in legal philosophy. Both the idea that law is a "practice" and has a "constructive" or "technical" nature come from earlier conceptions of law. The two most important amongst them are natural law and legal realism. These conceptions provide an essential framework necessary to get an adequate understanding of the post-positivist conception, but at the same time the latter impose on them a severe critical correction no less profound than does on legal positivism.

Natural law theories inherit the Aristotelian idea of "praxis" and its characteristic commitment to values, yet they come to oversize these values distorting the constructive connection existing between them and legal practices (thus becoming a kind of absolutism). Legal realism, in turn, emphasizes the element of construction—the technical and instrumental aspects of law—but ignoring now values (it thus becomes skepticism). Post-positivist theories simultaneously reject both positions as they converge in distorting the true function of legal practice. For them the starting point is to assume the priority of ethical-political values. These are seen as objective ideals that explain the raison d'être and the differentiation of law as a whole and into its diverse institutions. The materialization of such ideals and values, however, can only be socially achieved through a continuous process, necessarily creative, of implementation and permanent putting into application the very legal machinery of rules and procedures: that is the point of legal praxis as an enterprise. The constructive nexus between institutions and ideals is, then, the great idea expressed by Dworkin's and Nino's metaphors. Let's start by introducing them.

### 2 Dworkin's Chain Novel and Nino's Cathedral Metaphors

In Chapter 7 of the Law's Empire, Dworkin connects his concept of "integrity" to the notion of a "consistency of principle" which should lead to the "best constructive interpretation of the community's legal practice" (Dworkin [1986,](#page-113-0) p. 225; [1982a,](#page-113-0) p. 540ff.; [1982b,](#page-113-0) p. 166ff.; [1985,](#page-113-0) p. 158ff., pp. 407–408). There would be many similarities, he says, between the judicial practice that determines law through such type of "constructive interpretation" and the activity of a literary critic that elucidates the different dimensions of value offered by a literary piece. The judges, however, would be both authors and critics, and their intervention in the practice should be clearly "more direct" (Dworkin [1986](#page-113-0), p. 229). In the legal practice the distinction between author and interpreter, between creating and interpreting, is "a (false) dichotomy" and should rather be understood as referring to two different aspects of one and the same process. To show this, Dworkin proposes to make the comparison between law and literature—the "aesthetic hypothesis" [(1985](#page-113-0), p. 149)—even more precise by imagining "an artificial genre of literature that we might call the chain novel":

In this enterprise a group of novelists writes a novel seriatim; each novelist in the chain interprets the chapters he has been given in order to write a new chapter, which is then added to what the next novelist receives, and so on. Each has the job of writing his chapter so as to make the novel being constructed the best it can be, and the complexity of this task models the complexity of deciding a hard case under law as integrity (Dworkin [1986](#page-113-0), p. 229).

Dworkin differentiates two moments in the process of interpretation. First, a "fit" moment, which attempts to capture the meaning of the text under the light of the type of enterprise that it represents and the guiding principles of its genre (a novel in this case). Second, a "substantive" or "soundness" moment, that leads to determine which of the different readings resulting from the previous formal moment would be the more adequate to continue the enterprise in the best possible way from a critical point of view (Dworkin [1986,](#page-113-0) p. 231; [1985,](#page-113-0) p. 408). Thus, Dworkin concludes, there is no space to "draw any flat distinction between the stage at which a chain novelist interprets the text he has been given and the stage at which he adds his own chapter, guided by the interpretation he has settled on." (Dworkin [1986,](#page-113-0) p. 232) The same would happen in judicial interpretation, especially in hard cases (Dworkin [1985,](#page-113-0) p. 159). The two moments of the interpretative process—fit and soundness—would jointly reflect the ideal of law's integrity. Hard cases emerge when the first moment does not allow a choice between two or more possible interpretations. Then the judge must decide "by trying to find, in some coherent set of principles about people's rights and duties, the best constructive interpretation of the political structure and legal doctrine of their community" (Dworkin [1986,](#page-113-0) p. 255).

Each judge must regard himself, in deciding the new case before him, as a partner in a complex chain enterprise of which these innumerable decisions, structures, conventions, and practices are the history; it is his job to continue that history into the future through what he does on the day. He must interpret what has gone before because he has a responsibility to advance the enterprise in hand rather than strike out in some new direction of his own. So he must determine, according to his own judgment, what the earlier decisions come to, what the point or theme of the practice so far, taken as a whole, really is. (Dworkin [1985,](#page-113-0) p. 159)

Carlos Nino, in turn, entitles the §17 of his Fundamentos de Derecho Constitucional under the heading "The Constitution and the cathedral" (Nino [2013,](#page-113-0) p. 63ff.; [1996,](#page-113-0) p. 33ff). The suggestion is now to introduce as a "rationality model" of the constitutional practice the analogy with the long and complex historical process of building a cathedral. This model would appropriately symbolize how such a process constitutes a highly complex type of conventional practice. This consists of actions and decisions that are not taken in isolation, but rather need to coordinate to each other and in fact are part of a collective and interactive process that extends through time across generations. At the core of the analogy is the architect who must continue with the construction of a cathedral that has already been initiated, assuming that the work is underway before him and that it will probably not be completed by him, but instead by other builders afterwards. Each architect draws inspiration from his own construction style (e.g. the gothic style) and uses it as a parameter to evaluate and judge "the merits of the incomplete building whose construction he must continue" (Nino [2013](#page-113-0), p. 64). If despite the deficiencies the already existing construction may exhibit under her current architectural criteria and aesthetic values, the architect deems that continuing with the project is still valuable, and that this is anyway a better option than simply abandoning or demolishing the building or undertaking a new project ex nihilo, then his actions must take necessarily into account the portion that has already been constructed as well as the parts that other architects will possibly construct in the future. So, the architect's assumed ideal of a gothic cathedral cannot be immediately and completely materialized in the actual process of construction. This reveals the existence of an "specific rationality for action in collective works", when it comes to applying such ideals "to an action that contributes to that work without having control over the total work" (Nino [2013,](#page-113-0) p. 65). The same situation we find in the legal practice, where constitution founders, legislators or judges are only able to make a singular and modest contribution to a common project that is actually the overall intentional—and non-intentional—result of innumerable agents over long periods of time. Hence, the kind of rationality constrained by certain decisions of other agents that this practical, collective scenario imposes is a "second best" rationality. Sometimes the most rational option may be to take sides, not for the optimal values ideally speaking, but instead for alternative ones of a more modest value, since these would be actually the right ones that can prove to be more effective in achieving those other optimal or ideal principles in the long run. Thus, it would be irrational for a judge to solve a case "as if he was creating the whole legal order through his decision, or the legal order relative to that question" (Nino [2013,](#page-113-0) p. 67). Instead, the participant in legal practice must perform a type of complex reasoning that articulates over two levels. First, it globally evaluates the existing legal practice under the light of the values and principles that it allegedly promotes. If it turns out to be a legitimate practice, even if imperfect—yet in a way that appears more reasonable or realistic than other alternatives—then we step into a second level. This implies the agent's acceptance of the established institutional framework as the most appropriate to carry on the practice and then she proceeds to justify particular decisions within it that can contribute to preserve and improve such practice under the guidance of the values that overall legitimate it, even if imperfectly. This way, it is possible to determine some limits to the ideal reasons that would follow from those values, and then some limits to the legal practice as a whole. For the preservation of legal practice itself requires excluding certain justificatory reasons that, even if in abstracto result most legitimate, given the circumstances must yield to "second-best" alternatives. Otherwise the fundamental legal values, and therefore the whole legal practice as such, could become self-frustrated on the long term (Nino [2013,](#page-113-0) p. 74).

### 3 Constructivist Models of Law: A Brief Historical Survey

If we agree that philosophy builds concepts with images, while art builds images with concepts, the persistent presence of metaphors throughout the history of legal philosophy is hardly surprising. A conception of law can be defined as a kind of theory that incorporates at its core some model that can supply some plastic representations of the complex array of actions, norms, techniques, institutions, concepts and doctrines that make up legal phenomenology. This is exactly what the aforementioned metaphors do: they propose a "transference" (metaphorein) or "projection" of relationships of some kind from a primary domain ("source") towards a secondary one ("target") in such a way that it makes possible to describe the second as if it was the first (Black [1962,](#page-112-0) p. 53ff.; [1993,](#page-113-0) p. 28ff.; Ortony [1993)](#page-114-0).

The vast variety of models that have been projected into the field of law can be divided in two large classes: theoretical and practical models. The former are associated to a scientific model of rationality and their projection onto the law seeks to illuminate theoretical or epistemic relations and values (e.g. truth, deduction, systematicity, objectivity). Thus the mathematic models, 1 the naturalist models ("organic" metaphors), 2 and overall, the logical models. 3 As to the practical models, they correspond with the sphere that the Greeks called praxis: that is, those forms of action characterized by the implementation of certain values or virtues under the light of phronesis or "prudence" as eupraxia or "good practice". The prototype of praxis for Aristotle is morality and politics (which he jointly names politiké) but also law: hence its very characterization as jurisprudence, which presupposes conceiving the activity (agere) of lawyers, judges and legislators as a deliberative and prudential practice ultimately oriented towards justice, the highest political-moral virtue (ars boni et aequi).

Between the theoretical and the practical a middle position is taken by a third type of models that constitutes the central interest of this paper because of its constructive nature: the technical models. Ever since antiquity, the technique (techne) is conceived as a type of transitive production (poiesis, facere) of objects, artefacts or constructs of various genre. Now it is in these very products where the pertinent values lie, and not so much in the individuals' actions themselves (without which, however, they cannot exist at all). Techniques differ therefore from practices by the higher degree of objectivization that the production of objects imposes and by the decantation of rules and procedures oriented towards such production. This explains its close relation to the sciences—the techne takes an intermediate place between the phronesis and the episteme—intensified by later technologies. The more impersonal the artefact produced by the technique, the more this technique is based on objective values. Some objective techniques are close to the "mechanicist" theoretical models, from which arise the analogies of juridical-political phenomena with autoregulated or automatized machines (paradigmatically, the clocks [Mayr [1986](#page-113-0), p. 54ff., 102ff.]) or the engineering metaphors, and even the architectonical metaphors themselves, all of them sharing a distinctive constructivist character. Nevertheless, the techniques

<sup>1</sup> Let us just cite two very distant references from one another: the Aristotelian distinction between justice as geometric and arithmetic proportion (Eth. Nic., V) and Kelsen's Neokantian view on jurisprudence as a "geometry of the legal experience" (Kelsen [1923](#page-113-0), p. 93ff).

<sup>2</sup> Organic metaphors are ubiquitous and sometimes deceitful. One good example of that can be found in R. von Ihering, who in its first formalist period (The Spirit of Roman Law) referred to the "anatomy" and the "physiology of the legal organism" as well as to the "analysis" and the "synthesis" of the concepts, while in its latter period (The End in Law) when his approach was explicitly teleological and functional—no longer "mechanicist"—he however talked about "social mechanics". The organic metaphor inspires otherwise the idea of law as a ramification of morality (Dworkin [2011,](#page-113-0) p. 405ff.: "A tree structure") and it also underlies other well-known images like the "legal transplants" of legal comparatists (Watson [1993,](#page-114-0) p. 21; [2001:](#page-114-0) Ch. 7-8) or the "eye" of the law (Stolleis [2010)](#page-114-0).

<sup>3</sup> The image of law as an "axiomatic system" has been a persistent methodological ideal for legal rationality from the antiquity (when the Euclidian ideal of science was established as a system of propositions deduced from axioms) until contemporary times (when t formal logic is applied to law), including middle (Thomist iusnaturalism) and modern ages (the iusrationalist ideal of codification). See Alchourrón [1996](#page-112-0); Alchourrón and Bulygin [2012](#page-112-0).

are practices characterized by the fact that they generate products. Products such as the literary works (the tragedies of the poetica), the speeches and discourses (the juridical, political and moral logoi of the techne rethoriké), the medical remedies. These would be "constructs" that are qualified by virtue of their instrumental goodness with regard to the internal ends or goods of the respective art (efficacy, goodness, correct persuasion, health, etc.). Even if they are different from the "objective" devices of the different arts and crafts, they share with them an equally constructive conformation.

This brings us right to the central meaning of our metaphors. The chain novel and the cathedral apparently represent, according to the said above, technical metaphors that are diametrically opposed to each other: a (beautiful) art and a (mechanic) technology. However, this appearance disappears if we consider the kind of values pursued by them. They do not deal with values of ultimately theoretical character (truth or objectivity), for in that case the type of construction concerned would involve technologies indistinguishable from sciences and therefore completely separated from practices. 4 When techniques deal, instead, with values of ultimately practical character, as it happens with architecture, engineering, medicine or navigation (all of them frequent metaphorical images of law), then the corresponding rules, procedures and products are entirely subordinated to the practical activity of the subjects, since such activity is its very purpose and only in its exercise the pretended values could instantiate. The techniques in question consist of an undertaking or enterprise, a continuous course of action. Its constructive dimension is then a consequence of the fact that practice (the action) and technique (the rules, procedures and products) are intertwined as two aspects or dimensions of one and the same complex process.

Now, it is precisely this fundamental imbrication between the practical and the technical—the agibilium and the factibilium—what our two metaphors share in common. Although they both highlight the constructive element of legal praxis as well as its instrumental element, the point they essentially focus on is the subordination of both aspects to the achievement of ethical-political values of justice, that is, to practical values. This variety of practical constructivism was early on applied on law by Aristotle ([1995)](#page-112-0), when he analyzed the legislative activity as a type of "architectural prudence" (arkhitektoniké phronesis). 5 The kind of deliberation

<sup>4</sup> Let's consider in that sense, for instance, a famous mechanic metaphor with enormous importance within the legal field—the scale—which has survived from ancient times as a traditional icon of justice itself (Kissel [1984](#page-113-0), p. 92ff) and has been associated with the liberal ideology (checks and balances) that liquidated the mechanicist authoritarianism of the old regime (Mayr [1986](#page-113-0), p. 139ff.). Its constructive meaning, however, substantially changes when interpreted under theoretical values (in congruence with its original context as a measuring instrument first for craftsmen and later for physicists) and it is then associated to supposedly objective scales and magnitudes, as it is the case in R. Alexy's "weight formula" (Alexy [2003](#page-112-0)).

<sup>5</sup> The legislator that "establishes" or "gives" the law (nomothetes) actually produces it as a "craftman" (demiourgos). Just like a weaver or a houses or ships builder, he manufactures certain types of objects: laws (nomoi, including the foundational laws or constitutions) which are the "works" (erga) of politics (Eth. Nic., VI, 8, 1141b24-6; X, 9, 1180a21-3; Pol., II, 12, 1273b32-3;

involved in legal rules is compared to techne (e.g. the "flexible leaden rule" used by Lesbian builders that "adapts to the shape of the stone" [Eth. Nic., V, 10, 1137b34- 1138a3]), but it finally resolves into a practical compromise in relation to the values of justice they are meant to materialize.

This practical constructivism took, however, a pronounced intellectualist turn all along the natural law tradition. On the one hand, the relationship between positive law and natural law was tendentially interpreted in terms of theoretical values: as a derivation or conclusion, not anymore a practical construction. On the other hand, since this was a conclusion or consequence of practical moral principles or values, it was produced by means of an operation of determinatio which Thomas Aquinas ([1956)](#page-114-0) compares again with the labour of an artifex or builder. 6 Under this conception, though, the law ends up collapsing with morality. Strictly speaking, there is no room in it for legal reasons as distinct from moral reasons: insofar as there are actual practical reasons for acting in the legal sphere, these will be moral reasons and, insofar as they are not moral, legal practice is reduced to a mere "technical" instrument, a simple pragmatic and contingent device that can be instrumentally effective in achieving social coordination but is no longer guided by practical reason (Finnis [1990,](#page-113-0) p. 7ff). The so called determinationes lose, then, their constructive connection to praxis and values turn into self-evident "moral absolutes" (per se nota) making part of an "comprehensive" conception of religious character. 7 This is precisely what a sound moral constructivism denies, as it conditions universality and objectivity of whatever principle of justice to certain discursive rules and processes ("overlapping consensus", "reflective equilibrium") that practically and institutionally mediate between the different substantive conceptions (Rawls [1987;](#page-114-0) Nino [1989;](#page-113-0) Atienza [2017,](#page-112-0) p. 200ff). Then, the material justifications of legal decisions, which are for sure guided by moral ideals, are not, however, merely "given" by such higher principles or values pertaining to an ideal, moral order, but they rather ought to be constructed bottom up from the very social and political practice.

VII, 4,1326a30). These works have an "architectonic" character because they constitute the "order" (taxis) of the political community out of an institutional design or arrangement. The whole activity within the polis must remain governed by constitutional rules (the politeia that establishes the regime structuring public powers) and legislative rules: not only the activity of citizens in general, but also that of the political authorities themselves, the rulers, who are subject in their relations with the citizens to the legal rules "as manual workers [heirotechnai]" to the builder's design (Eth. Nic., VI, 8, 1141b29).

<sup>6</sup> The positive law is produced "in the same way the constructor (artifex) has to determine the common design of a house in the figure of this or that house" (Sum. Theol., I-II, q. 95, a. 2; see Finnis [1989](#page-113-0), p. 284ff., 294ff., 380). For Aristotle [(1995](#page-112-0)), positive law or "legal justice" (nomikon dikaion) is "that which is originally indeterminate, but when it has been laid down is not indeterminate anymore" (Eth. Nic., V, 7, 1134b20). The "determination" of law is then a kind of practical production of an object that does not exist before such a production, remaining in strict dependence on the specific actions of legislators, magistrates and judges.

<sup>7</sup> See Finnis [1989](#page-113-0), p. 295, 371ff.; Kelsen [(1946](#page-113-0), p. 265) was perfectly right when he conceptually connected any form of natural law to a theological hypothesis.

Undoubtedly, the conception of law that in contemporary legal philosophy has most vigorously underscored the practical dimension of law, i.e. its dynamic, procedural and simultaneously technical and constructive character, is legal realism. A very important metaphor in this regard is that of law as "social engineering" introduced by Roscoe Pound [(1923](#page-114-0), p. 150ss; [1940](#page-114-0)-1, p. 3ff.; [2002](#page-114-0), p. 234ff.; see Llewellyn [1931](#page-113-0), p. 1236), which conceives law as an "activity" or "law in action", so making way for an instrumentalist approach (Summers [1982;](#page-114-0) Pérez Lledó [2008;](#page-114-0) Tamanaha [2006,](#page-114-0) p. 101ff.). "Law itself", according to Llewellyn's famous motto (2008 [1930], p. 5), is nothing but that what legal officials do (Frank [1963,](#page-113-0) p. 46ff., 138). This "do-law" clearly reveals the underlying turn towards praxis that transforms the law in books into a means to an end, instead of "an end in itself" (Llewellyn [1931,](#page-113-0) p. 1236), a transformation already anticipated by von Ihering ([1970)](#page-114-0). 8 Thereby the metaphor of "juridical machinery" (a frequent expression by Llewellyn) becomes totally deprived of all its possible "mechanistic" connotations. On the contrary: that image displays the legal apparatus as the deployment of action itself that consists in recurrently proposing and attaining ends that transcend law—as an ongoing process, a "flux" or "moving law". The technique is then totally immanent to a praxis. The instruments or artifacts of such a technique (i.e. the precepts and procedures themselves: "rules for doing") refer to a practice being exercised ("rules of doing", "working rules", "real rules"... not just "paper rules"). 9 And this is precisely what gives this technique its distinctively constructive character.

Realism is yet an essentially open practical constructivism. It suffers from an intrinsic skeptical tendency, that has deleterious effects both on the evaluative or ideal element of law and even on its very technical or instrumental aspect. The development of legal practice is rarely considered by realists under the perspective of the possible justification of its coercive operations, nor of the respective institutions. Instead, the dominant perspective is that of those strategic professionals who must calculate in advance or "predict" their production or consequences: that is, the perspective of the "bad man" or his alter ego, the attorney. This purely technical, non-institutional standpoint turns legal rules into evaluatively neutral devices, once they are washed up with "cynical acid" (according to another famous technological metaphor of Holmes [1952, 174]), or become more or less "malleable", "pretty playthings" that can be put "into temporary anesthesia" from a moral viewpoint (in Llewellyn's famous words, 2008 [1960], p. 7, 107). According to the more radical realist versions, legal rules and procedures lack almost all justificatory force as they get reduced to mere disguises for the "rationalization" of decisions

<sup>8</sup> See Atienza [2017](#page-112-0): chap. 1. The mature writing of von Ihering [(1970](#page-114-0)) Der Zweck im Recht (1877), published in the United States in 1913 under the title Law as a Means to An End (Boston: Boston Book Co) had, via Pound, a significant influence on the realist movement, that turned the expression into an slogan (see Llewellyn [1931,](#page-113-0) p. 1223). Tamanaha [2006,](#page-114-0) p. 60ff.

<sup>9</sup> Llewellyn [1931](#page-113-0), p. 1236. Holmes [(1952](#page-113-0) [1897], p. 172, 174) had referred to the uninterrupted chain of "operations of the law" that interfere with social practices through "material consequences" whose most patent manifestation is "coercion" or "public force".

(Frank [1963,](#page-113-0) p. 140). No legal decision would be genuinely "determined" from within the law, no argumentation would be justifiably internal to the normative legal materials, but instead exclusively determined from "external" real rules (sociological, psychological, economic or political).

This radicalized tendency was continued during the last third of the twentieth century by the Critical Legal Studies and related movements, which combined legal realism with the Marxist conception of law as a "superstructure". 10 However, neither Pound nor Llewellyn defended the total rupture between the technical-institutional element and the ideal-evaluative one of legal practice. For them there are values intrinsic to the judicial machinery, embodied in its procedures, mostly the judicial, and in its rules, whether statutes—"valuable tools of social readjustment" [Llewellyn [2008](#page-113-0) [1930]: 16]; see also [2011](#page-113-0)— or judicial precedents. These values are thus considered to be more or less remotely connected with the ideals of justice.11 This was the orientation that finally prevailed in later most influential currents of North-American legal thought: Legal Process School, Lon Fuller, Robert Summers, etc. 12 And it is also from this tradition that Dworkin himself takes up the insight to found the thesis of law as a constructive practice oriented to the realization of political-moral values. The central argument behind the literary metaphor is to show (even against "pragmatism") to what extent in the field of law any "technical" element is necessarily evaluative. Here, exactly like in the field of art, the pivotal purpose of practice is to recreate, within the framework of established rules and institutions, some objective values whose validity, however, can only be manifested through that very practical recreation. Hence, Dworkin returns to the old connection between practice and values idiosyncratic to the praxis and makes it the hallmark of his criticism of legal positivism.

<sup>10</sup>It is revealing that an architectonic metaphor is here again at stake. This case it is yet a rather mechanicist or static one, as it differentiates between a "superstructure" (Überbau) and a "infrastructure" (Aufbau) supporting and "overdetermining" the former. This model tends to preclude virtually any autonomy of legal praxis due to its rigidly external, socioeconomic determinism: the jurist (specially the judge) is more of an "activist" than a "technician" or "social engineer", which accordingly takes strategic decisions that are "political", not institutional, on behalf of "ideologies", not of values. See Kennedy [1997:](#page-113-0) chaps. 6–8; Santos [2009,](#page-114-0) p. 551ff.

("legal justice"]), 174ff.; 461 ("common good"). Twining attributes to Llewellyn, of whom he was a student, the following phrase: "Technique without ideals may be a menace, but ideals without technique are a mess"] (Llewellyn [2008](#page-113-0) [1930]: 67n.).

For Summers [(1971](#page-114-0), [2006](#page-114-0)) law's "technique element" and "formality" always fulfill a moral function.

### 4 Legal Positivism: Law's Autonomy Around Rules

And thus we arrive at legal positivism. Despite the appearances, this is a conception of law unquestionably correlated to a constructivist approach. Yet have previously characterized it as a descriptive approach. This apparent contradiction is cleared up if we take into account that legal positivism is a structural and closed kind of constructivism: a form of "normativism" intimately linked to theoretical values and in particular to the notion of a "logical system". This is how the axiomatic or deductive ideal stands as the dominant model for the rationalization of the practical values of law, allowing the legal order to be implemented (and taught) in terms of consistency and completeness. In this sense, positivism is a "crypto-constructivism", that is persistently inclined to hide the obvious fact that the "legal system" is an "external system" or "master system", that is, a constructed system, that results from practical processes in which logic plays an instrumental role (Losano [2002:](#page-113-0) I, 168ff., 195ff.; II, Ch. I; Alchourrón [1996,](#page-112-0) p. 333ff., 348).

Legal positivism reverses the steps taken by realism in order to conjure its skeptical risks. Now the look on legal practice focuses exclusively on the norms as law in books. The law is reduced to a completed product, an "object" or "thing", a "normative system" that introduces a sharp cutting line with respect to the previous practices from which it results and only generates subsequent practices in a strictly endogenous or immanent sense. Legal practice as an "activity" remains confined to the "structure" (the system), i.e. the space demarcated by the rules-product. And thus such practice gets "overdetermined" by this structure as a self-enclosed system. Law is a closed down system, in which all construction is actually reconstruction or "selfproduction". The two decisive criteria in this regard are the "authoritative closure" (based in the internal continuity between legal practices, in terms of the notion of "intention") and the "normative closure" (based in the postulate of an "ultimate norm" or "master rule" that provides validity to all the others). Both strategies are, naturally, always interwoven. For legal rules always outcome of authoritative intentions that generate canonical texts and propositional contents the normative "validity" of which consists in their being recurrently applied ("application intentions", "intent") in congruence with the ulterior purposes these propositions are aimed to and reflect in its structure ("further intentions", "purpose"). This defines the relevant scope of legal interpretation (Raz [2009,](#page-114-0) p. 349ff.; Marmor [2005,](#page-113-0) p. 127ff.; Barak [2005,](#page-112-0) p. 126ff.). The legal closure is formulated under different varieties—purely formal-normative (Kelsen), authoritative (Hart, Raz), logical-subsumptive (Alchourrón and Bulygin, Ferrajoli, Schauer)...—but it has always the same effect: to show the practice of law as essentially independent of external or subjective evaluations and, consequently, as a kind of objective, "neutral" technique. Hence the thesis of law's value-free neutrality.

This is of course a sui generis kind of neutrality because it is taken for granted that law is an institution that existentially cannot put aside the moral and political values that appear as justifications of the overall system of legal rules. However, legal positivism assumes that these values are external to the legal system itself. For they are ideals located beyond the law, in the realm of morality and particularly politics where collective agreements are reached—whereas law itself is just the normative structure resulting from there. Essentially or conceptually, then, this structure can be analyzed in its very internal logic as such, independently of those values or at least in terms of relative abstraction from them. 13 This way is it possible for legal positivist methodology to concentrate on the routine legal practices forming the course or core of the legal system, those determined by the continued development of the intentions and semantic content of the legal rules (i.e. the "easy cases"). This is how the apparent prism of neutrality or distance typical of a "descriptive" point of view of "social facts", "conventions", or of the law "as it is" (the social thesis) arises. A point of view that is self-conceived as "external", stimulated by just "theoretical" or epistemic values, not practical ones (Postema [1998)](#page-114-0). "Description—Hart concludes in the Postscript (1996: 244)—may still be description, even when what is described is an evaluation".

The autonomy of law is therefore, according to legal positivism, strictly a function of legal rules insofar as they are self-referential and self-founded rules. The moral purposes and values relevant to law are those, and only those, already ("technically") categorized in its rules. The applicability and justifiability of such values become operative just by means of logical reasoning. This way the reproduction and transfer of legal rules' propositional contents to new rules and decisions within the limits of the system is enabled and the required "technical" objectivity secured. Legal reasoning is ultimately a classificatory or subsumptive reasoning, formulated in deductive terms. So, this "technical closure", that remains a constructive one, establishes internally and negatively the practical and autonomous differentiation of law as a social, highly institutionalized convention that self-segregates from morality.

Certain basic metaphors used by legal positivism perfectly illuminate this essentially negative way of conceiving the autonomy of law in terms of a clean cut or "separation" of its technical-institutional dimension from the ideal-evaluative one. They are images inherent to the standard legal-positivist view on rules as "entrenched", "opaque", "exclusionary", "peremptory", "content-independent"

<sup>13</sup>For instance: the "dynamic system" of law necessarily contains—Kelsen admits—"value judgements", but these are only "relative" or "subjective", not "objective" judgments, and thus law might actually incorporate "whatever content" (Kelsen [1960,](#page-113-0) p. 65ff., 204ff.); the moral-political functions of law as a system of rules allows require a "minimum content of natural law", Hart concedes, but the validity of that system can be conceptually separated from any correction contents (Hart [1983](#page-113-0); 1996, p. 185ff); law morally claims authority, but can be identified regardless of any evaluative consideration (Raz [1995,](#page-114-0) p. 210ff); the "axiomatic basis" of a legal system depends on the system of values that constitutes the legislator's "relevance thesis" (Alchourrón-Bulygin 2002, p. 149ff.), and the formulation of the factual and normative predicates of any single rule can only be designed on the basis of value judgments relative to its rationale or "underlying reasons" (Schauer [1991](#page-114-0), p. 23ff), but this evaluative dimension can be set aside and the attention focused just on the formal-propositional relations of logical consequence.

logical-linguistic devices. 14 Under these conceptualizations hide out constructive, architectonic metaphors of a basically structural and static format. The role of legal rules is limited to passively "shield" a self-sufficient and autonomous space of justification or validity for the legal practice. Such a function is performed by building a "containment wall" against value judgments or material principles as if these were extra-legal elements, instead of the very foundations of such rules. Only exceptionally, once a wall's structural failure occurs and "interstices" (i.e. fissures) appear—an image Hart that uses to illustrate the "discretion thesis" and he borrows from Holmes and legal realists 15—would it be inevitable to resort to evaluative judgments. Then the legal technique makes transparent its "creative", dynamic and constructive face, its deliberative nature related to principles and values. Yet this is seen as a sort of "intrusion" of the moral and political considerations within the "limited domain" of the law (Schauer [2004,](#page-114-0) p. 1942). Evaluations are necessary in law only to the extent that rules generate severe counterproductive outcomes because of their ordinary logical automatism.

All of these "crypto-constructivist" images clearly suggest the idea that the institutional technification of the law, within the framework of which the ordinary course of legal practice runs, precisely necessitates neutralizing, containing or repressing any value judgements not expressly stabilized by its rules, as if they were similar to "pathologies" (another repeated image) 16 or "toxic leaks" that represent a permanent and fatal threat to the structural and physiological mechanism of law, and even could cause, in the end, its destruction. The legal technique has to be in itself a "neutral" or value-free technique: its genuine "ideals" are formal and internal to the legal "institutional machinery"—efficiency, predictability, formal equalit, allocations of power—and not external, substantive ideals such as justice. Material injustices are just "suboptimal" effects, normalized technical "mistakes" (rules' or legislators') that do not alter at all the legal validity, which remains detachable and autonomous from morality (Schauer [1991,](#page-114-0) p. 135ff). The famous eight canons of Fullers's "inner morality of law" (1969, pp. 33–94)—requiring rules to be general, public, prospective, clear, consistent, effective, stable and congruently applied—have nothing to do with moral claims nor even with the correction principles coming from of a "procedural natural law"—we will come back right to

<sup>14</sup>Schauer [(1991](#page-114-0)); Raz (1990), p. 58ff; Hart [(1982](#page-113-0)), p. 243ff. It is worth noting that this approach to rules tends to survive in the post-positivist legal theories when they highlight rules all-or-nothing, subsumptive way of application (Dworkin 1978, p. 24ff.; Alexy [2003)](#page-112-0) or its "closed" structure (Atienza and Ruiz Manero [1998](#page-112-0): Chap. I). The hallmark of post-positivism, as we will see right away, lies however in the distinction between rules and principles and their mutual interplay. This distinction entails a priority of the axiological over the deontological dimension of law, since an internal "duality" is introduced both at the level of rules (which result from balancing operations and require evaluations in order to be correctly applied) and at the level of principles (that have values as content and can only be applied by means of rules).

<sup>15</sup>Hart [(1994)](#page-113-0), p. 273; Cardozo [(1921](#page-113-0)), pp. 113–114, 129. In his dissent in Southern Pacific v. Jensen, 244 U.S. 205 (1917), Holmes said: "I recognize without hesitation that judges do and must legislate, but they can do so only interstitially".

<sup>16</sup>See how Raz [(1995,](#page-114-0) p. 33) refers metaphorically in this regard to an "infection".

this. As Hart (1983, p. 347) states, such requirements are rather technically neutral imperatives, "principles of good craftmanship" compatible both with praiseworthy and perverse ends, exactly as by using them the carpenter can build "hospital beds or torturer's racks". In turn, for Raz the rule of law, consisting of a system of rules and procedures, is "a tool" that, just like any other, "is morally neutral in being neutral as to the end to which the instrument is put", exactly in the same way "a sharp knife" that is used to harm does not for that reason ceases to be "a good knife". 17

### 5 Legal Post-Positivism: The Autonomy of Law as a Matter of Value

Legal post-positivism completely reverses this understanding of the autonomy of law. The neutrality thesis is openly rejected since values are considered as the real criteria structuring legal institution and legal rationality as a whole. Law is a practical institution in the strict sense of praxis: i.e., its "technical" or formal dimension—the set of rules and procedures composing its normative "structure"—serves to the material achievement of fundamental political-moral values within a given society. The institution does not merely "reflect" such evaluative contents, but also presupposes the inescapable asymmetry between law as a "technique" and the moral rights and principles that it recognizes as its very foundations. Value judgements cannot be removed from the institutional legal sphere, but rather they need to be permanently articulated by reconnecting this sphere to its moral and political grounds. And this is where the constructive function of legal practice becomes prominent. Legal practice is the mediating enterprise between the technical dimension and the ideal or evaluative dimension of law.

So far, the legal practice had been seen solely in terms of the "empirical construction" of legal rules and techniques, either as an "open" pragmatic (realism) or "closed" logical (positivism) set of relations. But now the practice appears as the device for the materialization of the fundamental values justifying the rules and techniques of legal institutions themselves. These objective and ultimate ideals, insofar as they require being institutionalized at the large scale of a political community (or an aggregation of them), account then for the articulation of legal practice as a whole—therefore a political-moral enterprise—and explain its own "technical" and logically "closed" structure. Thus, practical values are the raison d'être of the theoretical values (logical or technical values) operating in law. Again, as in the original Aristotelian sense, there is a primacy of the praxis over the techne within the legal field. At the same time, it is now about an objectivist variety of

<sup>17</sup>Raz [(1979)](#page-114-0), p. 225. See, however, Raz ([1995](#page-114-0)), pp. 334–335, where he seems to retract from this "analogy between legal reasoning and reasoning about practical engineering problems, or more generally between legal reasoning and reasoning about matters which Kant identified as the realm of the useful and the Greeks called techne".

constructivism. Post-positivism step away from realist instrumentalism and positivist "normativism"—thus avoiding their respective skeptical and formalist drifts—as well as from the absolutist implications of natural law. Legal practice is seen as a matter of "construction" insofar as it is the productive and transformative medium that communicates, along a continued and recurrent process, the technical and logical-systematic legal apparatus with the political-moral values justifying it. The moral objectivist perspective assumed by post-positivism is then strictly inseparable from the justificatory function performed by legal practice in reference to ultimate values. This "ultimate" character means that those values are not merely "functional" in relation to any contingent, socially given interests or values—although they obviously must be empirically functional—but rather that they have a critical function in relation to the latter. The evaluative has a controlling role over the instrumental, not the other way around, and this is the essential feature of the legal institution.

We can now appropriately capture in their deepest sense the point of Dworkin and Nino's constructivist metaphors. They both highlight the architectonic dimension of values in the law as well as their totalizing or holistic dimension. The political and moral values entirely arrange the structure and function of the legal institution and guide the legal practice "as a whole". This is manifested specially in the role that principles play in the law. On the one hand, principles express certain ethicalpolitical ideals or aspirations that have foundations per se external to the legal institution. On the other, they reformulate such ideals in terms of internal legal criteria—whether substantive (fundamental rights or general policies) or formal (institutional or formal principles) (Dworkin [1977:](#page-113-0) chaps. 2, 6; Atienza and Ruiz Manero 1998: Chap. I; Alexy [2002,](#page-112-0) p. 47ff). These are criteria providing justificatory reasons and guidelines for legal (not just moral or political) validity that must be deliberated, incorporated and recreated in each one of the decisions integrating legal practice. Llewellyn ([1960,](#page-113-0) p. 191, 222) uses a powerful image to express this transversal dimension of values in law: they are like "grains" going across legal practice and according which particular decisions are "carved".

Yet values figure in legal practice under very different modulations. There is indeed a differentiation within the law as a whole in diverse institutional practices, functionally diversified but nevertheless mutually integrated. These are basically the legislative, judicial, doctrinal and professional legal practices. In each one of them values and principles perform different practical functions. Legislative and judicial practices, in their mutual concatenation, constitute the basic core of law as an institution, the mainstream of law as a praxis. They monopolize the production and application of legal rules and it is their practical and holistic development what constitutes the target of Nino and Dworkin's constructivist metaphors whereas realism focusses on professional and positivism on doctrinal practices. Those metaphors exhibit the legal practice as a continuum in progress in which both sub-practices—production and enforcement of legal rules, in turn attached to other standards and procedures—internally link together keeping definite equilibrium relations of functional separation and mutual deference. Such institutional relations are, in the end, governed precisely by substantive ideals or values (such as equality, liberty, autonomy or dignity) that shape and justify their respective procedures: the democratic legislative process based in political representation and the judicial process based in impartiality. The maximization of those material values, given the concrete circumstances, is then demanded to every particular decision integrating the legal practice. This requirement determines its constructive character.

Let us consider first the intrinsically evaluative structure of the practice of legislating. Although it arise from instrumental, mean-end schemata (framed in turn by wide political projects of social transformation and policies) the legislative practice necessarily requires evaluative deliberations and balances as it consists in the activity of constructing rules out of principles. Legislating as an activity needs to satisfy certain value parameters since congruence is necessary to achieve the unity of purpose towards the general interest any law is aimed at (Atienza [2013](#page-112-0), p. 712ff.; Ekins [2012](#page-113-0), pp. 118–142; Oliver-Lalana [2005](#page-113-0)). Legislative praxis (constitutional one included) is yet an essentially "open" activity. There are numerous ways of formulating legal rules and of composing them with different purposes under the same set of principles. None of such possibilities can be completely prefigured in advance, given its closely dependence on social change, ideological-political stance, constitutional history and other variables. But this does not mean that the legislative activity is a completely "undetermined" practice. Its constructive character rather comes from the fact that every new rule is the result of the specific and singular balancing operation that underlies every legislative act. This operation has to find an adjustment—even if deviating from them—to previously lay down legislation along a continuous, "cascading" process. The pertinent agreements must be reached both at the level of some publicly categorized courses of action and some reasonable values justifying them (Rawls [1993](#page-114-0), p. 133ff)

This explains why the kind of norms composing the basic instrumentarium of the legislative technique has to be specifically rules (that is, action-norms and end-norms [Atienza and Ruiz Manero 1998]). They must be general, plainly categorizing classes of actions and consequences, publicly promulgated (in a "master book"), pro futuro oriented, consistent with each other (within a "master system"), sufficiently stable, practicable and congruently applied norms, that is, they must satisfy Fuller's legality canons, precisely because "the enterprise of subjecting human conduct to the governance of rules" (Fuller [1969](#page-113-0), p. 96) is subject to the requirements of practical rationality. Those are then moral requirements, not just "procedural". For they represent at once conditions for the best possible institutionalization of any substantive moral and political values the law can pursue. In other words: Fuller's criteria embody the only rational way for a collective decision-making system to effectively maximize the moral basic values in the long term and on the large political scale. Therefore such criteria cannot be downgraded to a merely instrumental or formal level. They are central part of a "technique of authority", but at the same time they are definitory too of law as a "technique of justice" committed to the justifiability and correctness of its institutional products. 18 The fact that the technique of "legality" is dissociable from such and such particular purposes or material agreements does not make it a "neutral" technique appropriate to turn any rule into legitimately "legal". On the contrary: it is precisely by passing through the filter of those requirements when certain purposes make visible their greater or lesser content of injustice. The discussion about how radically unjust law puts into question its own legality (Fuller [1969](#page-113-0), p. 153ff., Alexy [1999](#page-112-0), Rundle [2009)](#page-114-0) clearly reveals that the technique of legality cannot be evaluative indifferent.

A general evaluation of this kind, in terms of justice, takes place in the first level of legal reasoning in which, according to Nino, the legitimacy of legal practice as a whole must be globally assessed by anyone of its participants. Once the evaluation is positive and a given institutional framework becomes globally justified upon it, then the particular legislative decisions that are developed within it must keep the best possible adjustment with the legislative decisions previously adopted, even if it comes to their amendment. This is what Nino's metaphor expresses when it refers to the cathedral construction as a process in which any decision taking part thereof, whether implementing the same architectural style or transforming it, needs to start relying on the work already built in the foregoing phases. Such a continuity must be constantly restored given the successive and cumulative products of legislative practice, coming from very different times and political decisions. Nino expresses with this suggestive analogy how legislative construction is an activity of materialization not only characterized by optimization but also by integration of styles and ideals aiming at opposite directions. In many occasions the optimal purported ideals can support not-so-good, relatively deviant, or "second-best" decisions, rather than drastic or supposedly "revolutionary" changes. 19 Such kind of deference towards the settled decisions and interpretations and such kind of relative deviations or "imperfect justice" (Rawls [1999,](#page-114-0) p. 74ff) are actually necessary conditions for the

<sup>18</sup>The rationality criteria of the "legislative technique" (linguistic, pragmatic-intentional, systematic, etc.) are in fact subordinated to an "axiological reasonableness" that is transversal to all them (Atienza [2013,](#page-112-0) p. 715). According to Fuller, the "internal morality of law" is not a "substantive" but rather a "procedural natural law", for it has to do "not with the substantive aims of legal rules, but with the ways in which a system of rules for governing human conduct must be constructed and administered if it is to be efficacious and at the same time remain what it purports to be". Hence it remains "indifferent toward the substantive aims of the law and is ready to serve a variety of such aims with equal efficiency" (Fuller [1969,](#page-113-0) pp. 96–97, 153).

<sup>19</sup>It is worth noting that the "gothic enterprise" has been spoken of as an holistic "idea" or amalgamation of technical, moral, religious and philosophical ingredients (Scott [2003](#page-114-0)). Erwin Panofsky has studied along these lines the influence of the scholastic philosophy on the gothic style: "Like the High Scholastic Summa, the High Gothic cathedral aimed at 'totality' and therefore tended to approximate, by synthesis as well as elimination, one perfect and final solution" (Panofsky [1976](#page-114-0), p. 44). Just like the scholastic dialectics, the construction progresses on the basis of a postulate of concordantia or reconciliation of styles and artistic and technical solutions in competition. In this synthesis work, sometimes constructive paths have to be projected that might apparently look erratic and deviant: "In retrospect, it is easy to see that what seems to be an arbitrary deviation from the direct road is in reality an indispensable prerequisite of the 'final' solution" (Panofsky [1976](#page-114-0), pp. 63–64).

preservation of the legal institution itself, for the durability of the global enterprise of law, outside of which no value would be achieved at all in the long-term. The two basic levels of legislative balancing—substantive and formal-institutional 20—are then bridges connecting the legal enterprise with morality and politics but, at the same time, separating them from each other and so saving law's own differentiation (Nino [1994](#page-113-0)). The autonomy of the law becomes constructively safeguarded, therefore, by means of a combination of evaluative judgments and argumentations.

Finally we shall consider the practice of judging. To participate in the judicial institution is equally to continue a collective work through the exercise of evaluations and the rational foundation of the resultant value judgments. The practice of judges goes in the inverted direction than that of legislators. Legal reasoning comes back now from the particular cases given in the social practice to the general rules and principles that should govern them. Legislation is a practical "top-down" process, while jurisdiction is rather "bottom-up." Again, both the structure and function of the institution are essentially value-designed. Judges must look at the rules under the light of their axiological foundations when applying such rules to the situations presented before them. Exactly the same evaluative arrangement—the same organized set of political-moral ideals—that justifies the system of legality, or rule of law, now demands the institutional impartiality and independence of judges (and so the separation of powers). If legal rules constitute institutional "constructs" oriented to the achievement of valuable purposes and states of affairs, then a different institutional practice is needed for undertaking a new task: that of verifying that those values categorized by the rules are effectively materialized in the particular cases regulated by them. So, judges must correctly determine all and each one of the cases that are brought before them by applying all and only the legislative rules. This is what it means after all that these are rules pertaining to a "technique", i.e. "devices" or "instruments". Yet this technique institutionally transforms the position of the judge into a position of commitment or adhesion towards such legal rules. That is, a position not only deferential to the authority of the democratic legislator (thus ensuring the prima facie "technical" applicability of legal rules) but specially loyal to the claims of correctness and the substantive reasons underlying them, reasons that must be updated and recreated in every single judicial decision adopted on behalf of the legislator. Judicial practice then is the one that "encloses" or covers all other legal practices (legislative and administrative) because its institutional function is precisely to pronounce conclusively (which does not mean infallibly) on the correctness or incorrectness of any other decisions already taken in the law.

This is exactly the picture drawn by Dworkin's literary metaphor of the "chain novel". Judicial practice appears here as a collective, in fieri activity, a series of constructive and reconstructive operations of interpretation, in which judges act simultaneously as authors and critics. Judges have to get involved in a deliberative

<sup>20</sup>On "institutional reasons", see Summers: [1978;](#page-114-0) Atienza and Ruiz Manero [(2001](#page-112-0)); on "formal principles", see Alexy [(2014](#page-112-0)).

and evaluative activity indispensable to adopt those decisions that represent the best articulation of the basic values guiding the entire legal enterprise in relation to the concrete case at stake. These are the institutional values governing judicial institution itself (the novelistic genre in the case of the chain novel) as well as those substantive values that specifically shape the interpretation adopted by the judge (the author's literary style). Judicial practice is thus a set of interpretive operations composing and recomposing the normative legal materials in the light of the entire "architecture" of the principles and values that make up the law "as a whole". Judicial decisions transform the "indeterminate" diversity of such materials into a coherent unity and then ascribe this to "the Law", representing the entire community, not simply the legislator qua authority. This critical and totalizing nature of judicial practice is mirrored by its argumentative institutional articulation: reasoned opinion, review system, dissent voting, abstention and recusal, etc. And, of course, these features categorically discard any skeptical or value-free view on legal rules as "technical" devices that should be strategically malleable (in the realist fashion) or as a morally neutral "carpentry" (in the positivist fashion). From the judge's perspective—as opposed to the lawyer's and the professor's—the legal technique is internal to a genuine "practice" (praxis). As such, it is a technique that can only be conducted on the basis of substantive evaluations that fully engage judges in the attainment of certain purposes under certain political-moral conceptions justifying them. In sum, as a "technical" agent, the judge is subject to the imperative of determining the "one right answer": i.e. that of inquiring and ascertaining the best justificatory reconstructions for legal rules that could be produced, as premises for her decisions, out of the set of principles governing the whole legal system. Law, then, cannot be practically indeterminate, but simply practically uncertain (Dworkin [2011](#page-113-0), p. 90ff).

As a consequence, the so-called ""interpretive techniques" are not mere resources doomed to decisionism or judicial discretion. They do not constitute mere persuasive tools available for the "rationalization" of decisions (realism), nor are they occasional or exceptional expedients for the judge to make "extra-legal" evaluations when the rules fail (positivism—and natural law too). As we already said, legal practice widely transcends the judge's personal criteria and subjective motivations in relation to each particular case. The interpretation techniques are practical reasoning schemata based on principles that enable the rational reconstruction of the rules. The methodical significance of such schemata lies in bringing out the substantive and institutional reasons that objectively can justify a singular evaluation on the practical consequences to the case in presence derived from the legal rules taken as premises. They are thus constructive canons—"canons about how statutes are to be constructed", in Llewellyn's words (1960, p. 521ff). As such, their function is to find the interpretation that best satisfies the values involved in the light of the legal system in its integrity, "architectonically". This constructive, optimizing dimension takes places even in the so-called "easy cases", which supposedly would result just from the logical-subsumptive, "neutral" instantiation of legal rules. For the prima facie applicability of the "textual argument" also depends on value judgements only justifiable by invoking institutional and substantive reasons (just like all other arguments reinforcing literalist readings: a contrario, systematic, a fortiori reasoning, etc.). The distinction between "easy cases" and "hard cases" is actually itself evaluative. Easy cases are those correctly regulated, when literal interpretation is supported by principled reasons that are solid enough to generate an agreement about the relevance and coherence of the respective rule and the rightness of its practical consequences. A hard case is by contrast an incorrectly regulated case, in relation to which reasons arise solid enough to put aside the literal interpretation as an unjustified one—since either the rule did not regulate the right property of the case or regulated the wrong property. Then arguments are brought in favour of alternative rectifying interpretations (teleological, analogical, ad absurdum, etc. reasoning) that allow for increasing the coherence or reducing the incoherence of the initial incorrect interpretation. From this perspective it is quite clear why hard cases, as Dworkin points out, make the "creative" character of legal interpretation more transparent, as the disagreements and controversies of the interpreters become evident when they formulate opposite interpretations of the same rules and values. The constructive or transformative implications arising from the different conceptions or readings that each interpreter advocates for are much more ostensible when such readings entail alternative proposals for rule readjustment or coherentization regarding the case (soundness dimension). This constructive dimension is, however, also operative when there is convergence instead of divergence in the ways of amending the previously settled interpretation of the rules ( fit dimension), for cases are always dissimilar to each other and the continuity with such established interpretation is not totally "given" but rather must be turned explicit and materialized case by case.

Thus legal reasoning arises as a definitely practical, value-involved reasoning. Legal principles guide all the constructive resources of this reasoning and determine, through the mediating interpretations, the justified perimeter of the rules: i.e. both their "clarity" zone, where a correct adjustment between values and rules takes place (and the law is then "determined") and their "penumbra" zone, where disagreements and "indeterminacies" emerge that are solved by introducing coherence judgments, formulating exceptions and correcting legal gaps and inconsistencies (MacCormick [1995)](#page-113-0). This kind of strict practical rationality (praxis) subordinates the implementation of all its technical criteria (logical-systematic, semantic, intentional, authoritative, formal... criteria) upon conditions of genuine justifiability. However, although axiological congruence is the dominant imperative, this does not mean that all coherent outcomes are equally acceptable, that any interpretation can be justified. Coherence construction in the judicial practice has limits. It must safeguard above all the very institutional division of work within the legal practice as a whole. On the one hand, any constructive alternative available for judicial decision must be realistically framed within the interpretative routes and outcomes that the practice has defined in the past. Possible new jurisprudential lines or expectations that the selected interpretation may trigger in the future must be considered as well. This double retrospective and prospective assessment determines, in the same way as Nino, the two Dworkinian moments of reconstruction ( fit) and construction (soundness). On the other hand, it is also necessary for the judicial decision to preserve the impartiality of the judiciary itself and its proper function within the institutional <span id="page-112-0"></span>architecture of law. This is a particularly relevant requirement in such legal systems—as those recognizing constitutional rights—where judicial activism can give rise to a severe intensification of the constructive role of judicial authorities. In such systems, the configuration of "hard cases" (out of conflicts of rights that reflect moral and political controversies) and the judicial revision of legislation must be carried out, if legitimate, by preserving at all cost the singularity of the practice of judging. This constitutes a kind of practice which is not institutionally aimed at deliberating rules (such as legislative practice) nor at bureaucratically applying them in a "managerial" manner (such as administrative practice) (Fuller [1969](#page-113-0), p. 208ff.) Otherwise judicial practice would just collapse into politics. Any such "judicialization", often associated to moral scepticism, would be institutionally as unjustified as the "overinterpretation" of rights in terms of moral values, often associated to dogmatism. The implementation of ethical-political values through judicial practice takes place in a fundamentally different form, namely, the "propagation" (in Nino's own words) of such values across overall legal practice by means of systematically impartial, critical and uniform decisions. Legal reasoning always depends, then, on the imperative of preserving the internal equilibrium of legal practice. Contributing to the maintenance of the institutional physiognomy of judicial practice within the complex "technique" or "machinery" for collective decision-making which it is integrated in, together with the other legal sub-practices, is therefore a necessary condition for the generally stable realization, through all of them, of the fundamental political-moral values. The autonomy of law, in short, is one of those values.
