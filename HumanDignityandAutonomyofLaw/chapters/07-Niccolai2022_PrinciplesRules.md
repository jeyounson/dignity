# Between Principles and Rules

### An Itinerary Around Law's Morality and Human Dignity

Silvia Niccolai

Abstract The relationship between human dignity and Law, and between Law and Moral, are closely linked to the way in which we think of Law and theorize it. E.g.: if we understand Law as a set of commands assisted by sanctions, this, firstly, certainly does not enhance the dignity of the subjects of the Law, who are conceived as passive recipients of orders. Secondly, it leads to separating Law from Moral, which cannot be coerced, but drives us also to imagine Moral as a sort of Law, a set of rules addressed to individuals from the outside (from traditional habits, for example). One meaning of the word 'moral' fades, the one in which it indicates a quality of every single human being: 'moral' because intelligent, conscious, capable of choice. The same happens if we think of Law as a technique of social engineering and control, which directs human behaviour (even towards ends deemed morally valid, or useful). In all cases the result is seeing both Law and Moral as 'objective' realities that operate separately from the moral contribution of individuals, without the contribution of their sense and their intellect. In a word, separately from the subjective dimension. Whereas it is in this dimension that human dignity is rooted.

These considerations presupposed, the paper starts by recalling Dworkin's theses, which have meant a big change in the conceptions on Law and its relations with Moral. What, precisely, and how much have they meant in favour of a more 'dignified' (morally free and equal) vision of the 'subjects' of Law?

Without intending to give a general answer to this question, but aiming only to propose a practical example, the chapter follows the paths of Dworkin's thought in a legal culture strongly imbued with normativism, legal positivism, and legal instrumentalism, such as the Italian Constitutionalism. Here, 'principles' and 'rules' have been understood as functional equivalents of the 'norm' and not much has changed in the traditional view according to which Law is an instrument of social engineering, to the performance of which the moral freedom of the agent is scarcely relevant. This is due, the chapter argues, to the unwillingness of many scholars to recognize as a true 'principle' one of Dworkin's examples, which is a regula iuris rooted in

Roman Law and in the 'Ius commune': the prohibition of unjust enrichment. After suggesting some historical and cultural reasons that may have hampered the recognition of a principle in a regula, the chapter compares the dominant views with Alessandro Giuliani's alternative reading of the principles/rules issue. Giuliani's point is that principles are regulae, exactly in the sense of the ancient regulae iuris, which are as many constitutive principles of Law. The regulae are 'observations' and 'interpretations' of human behaviours; they are descriptive more than prescriptive; they function as centres of argumentation oriented by a logic of the 'preferable' which is rooted in experience and in common opinion, Giuliani maintains. Thus, the regulae express the connection between Law and the world of human action; they are reminiscent of an idea of Law not separated from the subjective experience. Thinking of principles as regulae, Giuliani renews the theme of the 'internal' Morality of Law, arguing that Law always presupposes the intelligent cooperation of (and between) human beings. This brings us to an intense re-evaluation of human dignity—as freedom and equality of, and among, moral beings in Law, which Giuliani evokes with the dialectics between the Moral of Obligation and the Moral of Virtue.

### 1 Maxims of Equity in Dworkin's Examples

## 1.1 Ancient Precepts

In order to explain his famous theory, Dworkin gave some examples of what a principle is and why it is different from a rule. The first example was illustrated in the Riggs v Palmer case, 1889, where a New York Court found that the defendant, who had killed the person whose estate he was the heir of, could not inherit; and this held notwithstanding the silence of the Law in this regard (Dworkin [1982,](#page-164-0) p. 91).

The principle that the judges relied on in that case corresponds with the legal adage Nemo locupletari debet ex aliena iactura, a regula iuris. The regula is in its turn a specification of the general precept Neminem Laedere, of the maxim Ex dolo malo and of similar sayings, all of which express the idea that no one should benefit from his wrongful acts.

The regulae iuris are a patrimony of precepts, criteria, or principles "in a generic sense" as Dworkin would say, that come from the ancient Roman Law and formed the basis of a European Common Law in the Middle Ages. Even after codification, this heritage has remained rather alive in Continental Europe too. Instances of correspondences between the regulae and the maxims of equity have for long been important in the education and practice of common law lawyers and the same goes for the compilations of regulae used by continental jurists.1 In Italy, after the

<sup>1</sup> Compare Wharton [(1925](#page-165-0)) to De Mauri [(1936](#page-164-0)).

Top 121 legal maxims for law exams, on [writinglaw.com.](http://writinglaw.com) Of

Civil Code of 1865, the Courts continued to apply the regulae iuris, even though scholars disapproved: these latter, who had in the whole adopted a legalistic approach, taught that all Law was in the Code (Giuliani [1982](#page-164-0), pp. 190 ff.).

The judges who referred to the regulae were of the same mind as the New York Court of Appeals in Riggs v Palmer, which was to moderate law and contract, taking into account something which has always to be recognized, even though the written law does not state it. This, if Law has to be truly Law, they thought. And indeed, after all: what Law would it be that rewarded the illicit and the fraud, or abuse? In 1877 the Florence Court of Cassation ruled that the Law could not but recognize the principle Malitiis non est indulgendum, even though the Code did not mention it. If law tolerates a situation where someone builds a wall on his property only in order to harm the neighbour, no one would believe in Law for long. And in what sense shall it spoken of Law, in a country where the Ruler can harm the rights of the Ruled? Paralleling Riggs v Palmer's concepts, the Rome Court of Cassation stated, still in the second half of the Nineteenth century, that an expropriated landowner had a right to compensation, and this precisely thanks to the moderating function of Law (Colorni [1946,](#page-164-0) p. 673). In fact, neither the Code nor Statute (the Constitution of that time) provided it. In the absence of any norms applying to work contracts, some Courts affirmed, on the basis of the Cuius commoda eius et incommoda principle, that the employer had to pay the employee also during periods of illness (Roselli [1980,](#page-165-0) p. 673).

Jumping in time to 1999, when assisted reproduction techniques were already widespread in Italy but not yet regulated, the regula iuris Nemo venire potest contra factum proprium transparently influenced a decision of the Court of Cassation which denied the right to disavow paternity to a man who had consented to his wife's heterologous fertilization (Patti [2000,](#page-165-0) p. 14). In 1992, a building abuses condonation law was annulled. In a ruling where exactly the same point of view held by the Florence Cassation of 1877 still resonates, the Constitutional Court reasoned that benefiting abusers had adverse effects on public faith and discouraged people from engaging in correct behaviour, thereby violating the Neminem Laedere principle, "constitutive of a juridical order".

## 1.2 Examples and More Than Examples

As an example of principle, Dworkin chooses a regula; but it must be said that Dworkin does not intend at all to rediscover the old maxims as legal principles due to some features specific to them—relating, for example, to their contents or to the way

course, Regulae and maxims do not fully coincide, and the compilations are not always the same; but there are strong concordances however, which signify the unity of European law prior to codification (Giuliani [1957](#page-164-0), p. 99). On the decline of the maxims in English law as a consequence of the advent of legal positivism see McQuade [(1996](#page-165-0), pp. 75 and 78); on their longer survival in US Law: Winkel [(2001](#page-165-0)), who explains with this the examples chosen by Dworkin.

in which these precepts have being formed. Principles express "exigencies of justice, correctness, or some other dimension of morality"; they come from "implications of the legislative and judiciary history" or from the "practices and interests of the community". To Dworkin, it is not so important where the principles come from, what counts is how they perform.2

Even though Dworkin does not say that maxims are the principles of the law, in his arguments the presence of maxims is not limited to the mere quotation of an example or two. To the contrary, maxims are at the basis of his theory. It is the antique maxim of equity indeed, "treating like cases alike", that plays the pivotal role of avoiding the Courts adjudicating on the basis of changeable policies, instead than on the basis of principles.3

Besides, the salient characters that Dworkin assigns to principles transparently recall the regulae's operation in the interpretatio based on fairness (equity) which was typical of Middle Age jurists' reasoning. The Italian Law philosopher Enrico Pattaro, in an important essay from 1987, recalled that in the post-classical period and up until the modern age "judges and lawyers did know well that there were many exceptions to the regulae, that these latter had not to be taken literally and could not be applied to all cases"; and he observed that "it is then clear that this point is of the greatest interest in relation to the recent and reputed theory of Ronald Dworkin on law's principles, which distinguishes these latter from the rules,4 among others things, for their flexibility which allows exceptions without prejudice on the validity of principles". 5

<sup>2</sup> In an essay of 1921, Roscoe Pound had posed the question whether the common law maxims, whose link with the regulae iuris was clear to him, could be considered general principles of law. To this question, which could have led to identifying a substantial content proper of the legal experience, the theorist of the law as social engineering technique responded in the negative: to function as principles, maxims need to be framed in a theory, in a legal conception, that explains and directs their functioning, otherwise they are "not yet" true principles. For Pound, a mature law system contains rules, principles and conceptions; each of them performs different functions in the system, which must be made explicit by a theoretical model (Pound Pound [1921](#page-165-0)). It could be said that Dworkin has provided a theory in which to frame the regulae.

<sup>3</sup> Rebuffa [(1980](#page-165-0), p. 219), who uses the Italian word regola in order to refer to what Dworkin calls principle; that is interesting in relation of the arguments discussed below.

<sup>4</sup> Regole, in Italian.

<sup>5</sup> Pattaro [(1987,](#page-165-0) p. 41). The point refers to the classic discussion on the medieval brocardo Exceptio firmat regula in casibus non exceptis, but it is worth noting that it was Paul's maxim, which opens the Digest's Book De Regulis Iuris Antiqui, to affirm that a rule can be put aside if in aliquo vitiata (that is, if not apt to a certain case or to a certain need), while continuing to be valid for the rest. Paul's definition was the object of the medieval jurists' traditio regulae (which consisted in the effort to understand Paul's definition of the regula, in order to apply it in practice) and therefore it is the basis from which reflections and practices have sprung up over time around the fundamental concepts of law: i.e. what a rule is, how it has to be applied, when it is valid, when it is not, etc. Paul says: "Regula est, quae rem, quae est, breviter enarrat; non ut ex regula ius sumatur, sed ex iure quod est regula fiat. Per regulam igitur brevis rerum enarratio traditur; et, ut Sabinus ait, quasi causae coniectio est; quae simul cum in aliquo vitiata est, perdit officium suum".

Furthermore, it is well known that at a medieval trial the regulae did assign a presumption in favour of the party who could invoke one of them as support of his action or claim, which recalls the dimension of weight of Dworkin's principles.6 Often in Dworkin's speech on principles the many metaphors do resonate, the same metaphors that have flourished in the bi-millennial elaboration of which the regulae have been the subject: the principles that offer a direction, without containing a decision, closely recall the regulae as "indicators of the law" of which Francis Bacon famously spoke. There are surely reminiscences of classical times behind the image of the judge Hercules. This latter, after all, does nothing but offering a substantial imago of the results that can be attained thanks to the subtilitas that Justinian recommended the interprets of the Digest to make use of, even though of course, Justinian's advice could also describe the efforts expected from an exegete in interpreting the law in books. In Dworkin's idea, according to which a rule becomes a principle thanks to the addition of expressions like 'normally' or 'according to good faith', it resurfaces exactly the way in which, according to some law historians, the regulae iuris were formed. Peter Stein, the author of a classic work of research on the matter, states that those who compiled the Digest's Book De regulis iuris, which is at the origin of the regulae's (and of the maxims of equity's) tradition, put together a whole of "juristic rules" (which were originally extremely detailed and very closely linked to a concrete and specific case), and generalized them by adding universalizing expressions like nemo, semper, numquam, omnia, etc.7

## 1.3 A Very Rich World

The success of Dworkin's theory can perhaps be explained, at least in part, by the fact that it sparks and evokes components of jurists' imagery and lexicon going back millennia (whether or not their memory is conscious) and are actually common among both common law jurists and civil law jurists.

It is not purely by chance that amongst the language and views advocated by Dworkin's opponents, references can be found to a world of ideas and expressions that, in the legal culture, have been shaped around the regulae iuris. Raz, for example, while criticizing Dworkin, described the principle as "a concise allusion

<sup>6</sup> See Pastore [(1985,](#page-165-0) p. 14 and 28). The praesumptio granted to those who can invoke a regula in support of their claim is still today the reason why it is believed that recalling a regula or a brocardo strengthens the persuasiveness of a lawyer's arguments ("gain an edge with more content about legal maxims" is, e.g., the recommendation the India Asian Encyclopedia, see the website india. lawi.asia) even though the reasons that explain such a presumption, anchored to the logic of the preferable that we will explore when recalling Giuliani's thought, are perhaps got lost.

<sup>7</sup> Stein [(1966](#page-165-0)), pp. 117–119, who, however, criticizes this method precisely because it would have betrayed the casuistic nature of a true judge-made law, typical in his view of the rules, moving them towards the model of norms.

to a number of norms"; this wording is very close to the definition of the regula offered by Paul's fragment which opens the Digest's V Book, where the regula is described as "brevis rerum enarratio, quasi cause coniectio". 8

Carriò, in his famous reply to Dworkin, started by saying that the prohibition of illicit enrichment (Dworkin's example) is a principle or standard that, in law, plays the same role as the advantage rule in football. In developing this comparison, Carriò uses words that recall the operation of the regulae in the medieval interpretatio: the advantage principle/standard is addressed to those who apply the rules, refers to the way in which rules have to be applied, serves to justify exceptions, is neutral as towards the merit of the problem at stake and goes together with a negative logic,9 a logic of the dispute, which progresses by confutation and justification.

Carriò includes among principles the "maxims, aphorisms, proverbs, fragments of wisdom that come from the past and bring with them the worth of accrued experience and the prestige of tradition"; he considers the usus fori the best way through which principles become "positive". Carriò aims to demonstrate that legal positivism does not at all ignore the "very rich world of principles". His point is that, according to legal positivism, the operation of principles only depends on whether the norms of recognition of a given legal order recognize them (or not) (Carriò [1970,](#page-164-0) p. 92).

In the following I will report some features of the way in which a regula (the regula Nemo audiatur allegans turpitudinem suam) has actually existed in the Italian Legal experience of the Twentieth Century. Contrary to what Carrio maintains, a regula is changed when applied in a positivistic model, which greatly influences the way in which principles operate. But, apart from this, what I would like to point out now is that the 'very rich world of the regulae' surfaces behind both Dworkin's principles and their criticism. This can be explained by the fact that the principles of ancient law have offered, over the course of time, room for the most diverse conceptions of the Law. To Kelsen, the regula iuris is the scholarly definition, as it is well known, a descriptive statement; to the German realists of the Free-Law movement the whole of the ancient regulae, exalted by the Pandettists, were the metaphor of a Law crystallized in dead dogmas and backstepped towards reality. But the regula of the regulae, the mother of all regulae, Paul's statement: non ex regula ius sumatur sed es iure quod est regula fiat, was to them the emblem of the reasons of the living law against the dead letter. Over centuries, the regulae have lent themselves to uses and interpretation far different from each other; to quote another

<sup>8</sup> It is Pastore [(1985](#page-165-0), p. 31), who attentively recalls this Raz's point [(1972,](#page-165-0) p. 828). Giuliani's thought, which we will retrace later, will help us to understand, if needed, that the model of the regula is recognizable also in those opinions, that define principles as standards of judicial technique having their source in common sense (Soper [1977](#page-165-0), p. 75, also quoted in Pastore [(1985](#page-165-0)), p. 35).

<sup>9</sup> This point is especially meaningful if connected to the Giuliani's reading of the regulae, which, as we will see, focuses on their negative character (the regulae as tools to avoid what is wrong, not to establish what is right).

example, they were the model on which the modern rationalistic natural law doctrines moulded the principles (axioms) of an invariable logic from which all the law was presumed to be deductible (the leges legum).10

### 2 A Principles-Oriented and a Rules-Oriented Idea of Law: Does It Make Any Difference? Suggestions from the Paths of Dworkin's Distinction Between Principles and Rules in Italy

## 2.1 Lost in Translation

In Italy, Dworkin's rules have been translated with the word regole, which corresponds to the Latin word regula. This has surely something to do with the fact that in Italy, the connections between principles and regulae—though put to the forefront by Dworkin's main example, which is a maxim/regula—have been underestimated, especially by constitutionalists (even if recognized by some Authors, as I have recalled above). As a consequence of Dworkin's language, which leads one to think that a regola (a rule) by definition cannot be a principle, it has been forgotten that, for long, in Italian legal culture, the idea itself of law's principles was expressed exactly by the regole (the regulae iuris). This is not extraneous to another fact, often noticed: in the unfinished research on the differences between principles and regole which has followed Dworkin's reception in Italy, the definitions by which scholars try to grasp the concept of regola are very artificial and disappointing (Cerrone [2012](#page-164-0), p. 633; Pino [2012](#page-165-0), p. 3). As a matter of fact, regola is an expression to which nothing corresponds in the Italian legal language but principle, while the idea, which Dworkin expresses using the word rule, mainly corresponds to the concept of a norm. Actually, Dworkin's 'Principles and Rules' would had better translated into 'Principles and Norms'. But here the problem was that, in Italy, the constitutional principles have always been considered as norms, and for a long time, scholars' most predominant preoccupation, far from being that of researching the differences between principles and norms, was that of affirming their identity, in order to give constitutional principles the most juridical strength. In turn, the fact that in Italy constitutional principles have always been considered norms explains why the main accusations addressed to those constitutionalists who have adopted the distinction between principles and rules, is that of having worked against, or at the expense of, the normativity of the Constitution.

It is worth saying that the acceptance of Dworkin in Italy took place at a very peculiar moment, especially for constitutional law. After the Italian Constitution entered into force in 1948, legal positivism was the undisputed ruler of constitutional

<sup>10</sup>As it happened in the Domat's and Pothier's systems, and see Stein ([1966,](#page-165-0) pp. 178–179) on this turning-point.

interpretation. The Constitution, and all its many wide and general principles, was considered as a normative act superior to ordinary laws; a programme of action, which had to be put into effect by parliamentary laws (and judicial interpretation). Scholars at that time were confident that the Constitution, thanks to its superior normative strength, would bind legislators and ensure that they implemented constitutional principles, which were full of emancipatory and reforming content (it was normal to describe the Constitution as a 'project of society', that had to be realized through the law). The legislature, composed by representatives from political parties, appeared in turn as the organ most apt to interpret the demands of justice, recognition and emancipation arising from the society, demands that were considered coincidental to the constitutional principles imbued with instances of social justice.

In the 80s, when Dworkin was translated, these concepts were beginning to decline: distrust towards the legislature, which was distrust towards the political parties, started to take place. The elaboration of this crisis of trust took a long time, but it came to bear very significant fruits in the decade between the early 90s and the early 2000s. At that time the new 'principles-oriented constitutionalism' has taken shape, opposing the 'rules-oriented' or 'legalistic constitutionalism', faithful to traditional ideas. While legalistic constitutionalism still considers legal positivism, as Bobbio taught in the 1960s, the theory of law best suited to describe a constitutional democracy (because it states that politics is subordinate to the Constitution, which entrusts the task of its implementation to the legislators, who represent the people), this neo-constitutionalism maintains that it is rather Dworkin's theory instead that provides the best explanation of how law functions in a Constitutional state.

## 2.2 A Principles-Oriented Constitutionalism

The two types of constitutionalism oppose each other because one maintains that the Constitution must be considered a norm, in the sense of a preceptive source of strictly normative nature (precisely a rule), while the other proposes the rediscovery of the Constitution as a set of principles, defined as the 'bridges' that allow the continuous adaptation of the law to the needs of society. The role of interpreter and implementer of the Constitution, as well as the role of interlocutor of societal needs, is transferred from the legislature and political parties, to the judge (in particular, but not only, the constitutional one); in this direction goes also the argument that, once the class struggle has faded and its interpreters have vanished, society is marked by a myriad of needs that cannot be traced back to political representation or systematized in an all-encompassing regulatory design.11

<sup>11</sup>The traditional references of progressive culture (the class struggle and the political party that expressed it, the communist party), had been lost. Progressivist jurists, who no longer saw the legislature as an expression of society and no longer considered society interpretable through the

Actually, the 'principles-oriented constitutionalism' has often been accused of having encouraged the non-physiological growth of powers of the judiciary, which has been witnessed in Italy, but, this said, much remains to say about its most relevant characteristics and implications. Principles-oriented constitutionalism, which in some ways differs greatly from Dworkin's theses, rigidly adopts Dworkin's distinction between principles and rules as an indisputable model, in order to underline the fact that, unlike rules—which function rigidly according to the 'all or nothing' criterion (i.e. if it applies it is valid, if it does not apply, it is invalid12) principles are capable of more flexible and evolutionary interpretation; therefore, thanks to the balancing and weighting operations they allow, principles are a more appropriate legal tool to handle the complexity and dynamism of a constitutional democracy.

As mentioned above, principles-oriented constitutionalism has promoted such opinions within a tradition that had always considered the constitutional principles as true norms and the entire Constitution as a norm of recognition. The most innovative, scandalous and provocative aspect of these theses then lies not in the fact that they have encouraged, much less discovered, creativity on the part of the judge,13 but in two very different outcomes. Firstly, the principles-oriented constitutionalism has affirmed, rather implicitly but clearly, that the Constitution could no longer be understood as the only norm for the recognition of principles (and this is a completely logical and direct consequence of Dworkin's positions) because principles come from the 'meta-law', which is to say, they come from what is beyond the law (from society, culture, etc.), and what is beyond law is also beyond the Constitution as a norm. Secondly, and for the same reason, principles-oriented constitutionalism has favoured an adaptive interpretation of the Constitution itself (after all, it is known that, even for Dworkin, principles "change rapidly", and as

schemes of the class struggle, turned to principles and shifted their confidence to judges. Of such a change of mind important testimony is offered by an essay published in late 1980s by the prominent legal positivistic law philosopher Scarpelli, where arguments are developed, very close to those that Zagrebelsky would advocate in his celebrated book, The Mild Law (Zagrebelsky [1991)](#page-165-0), with which principled-oriented constitutionalism was founded. After noting that the crisis "of law as code" is interconnected with important cultural transformations, in particular with "the very strong acceleration of social transformations" that exacerbates conflicts that are no longer "reducible to the class struggle", Scarpelli defines himself a "somewhat repentant believer in juridical positivism", and declares his hope in judge-made law, with which "the principles of law come to the foreground in juridical experience". Principles, Scarpelli maintains, from which "no consequences are deduced by way of narrow implications, [and which] serve to justify norms and decisions along the ways of a complex and flexible argumentative discourse", are more apt than legislative norms to govern pluralistic democracies (Scarpelli [1987](#page-165-0), p. 19).

<sup>12</sup>It is worth noting that this description of the regola, taken from Dworkin's definition of the rules, is the point of maximum departure from the tradition of the regulae iuris, which instead operated along a logic of the exception, or of equity (see the quotation from Pattaro in par. I.1. above and also note 5).

<sup>13</sup>At the time of neo-constitutionalism's rise, the law-making role of judges was already very strong in Italy, where the traditional formalistic conceptions of the role of the judiciary had gone through a massive anti-formalist revolt since the end of the 1960s.

such why should constitutional principles not change also?). The founder of pro-principles constitutionalism, Gustavo Zagrebelsky has always sympathized with philosophical (social) positivism's claims and greatly emphasized the need that law adapts to the needs of a changing society, needs that are interpreted—which goes without saying—by the society's pars melior.

In a nutshell: neo-constitutionalism has instigated an evolutionary process in the interpretation of the Constitution, which had always been imagined, on the contrary, as a table of values which although certainly not crystallized, was intrinsically stable and permanent, charged with the task of fuelling politics, but not destined to be fuelled in its turn from anything outside of it. The Constitution was imagined to be there to make politics evolve, and if the Constitution was itself the future and the progress, it did no need anything external that made it evolve and progress. This is the principle, that the principles-oriented constitutionalism has broken.

### 2.3 Adapting the Law. To Something External and Changing, or to Something Interior and Which Is Always the Same?

As I said, once Dworkin's principles and rules were translated into principles and regole, Italian constitutionalists, in a controversy that basically has raised the question of the Constitution as a norm, did not take into much account the fact that, in Italian law—like in the common European law of the intermediate age, up to the codifications and beyond—just the regulae iuris had represented, in the eyes of legal science, the closest thing to law's 'principles'.

The habit of Italian judges of the pre-republican period to go back to the regulae iuris, of which I gave some examples at the beginning, had developed thanks to the Civil Code of 1865. The Code allowed the judge to apply the general principles of law when a precise norm was lacking or when analogy was impossible. At that time, judges thought that the condition that authorized them to go back to principles (i.e., the absence of a norm for the specific case or of a similar norm) meant that they had to apply the principles every time they could not find an adequate norm, or more precisely a norm apt to what the respect of the Law always demands. The law always required (so they thought) the respect of some basic premises (for example, it requires that no one should enrich themselves from their fraud—everyone knows it); if written law did not mention these instances, then the general principles intervened to supplement the written law. Reasoning like so, the judges gave the regulae exactly the same space and role that, according to the pro-principles constitutionalists, is proper to 'true' principles only and which, according to them, was born only with the rise of the 'constitutional' principles: that is, the ability to intervene not only in the event of gaps in written laws, but always, at any moment, in the interpretation and application of written laws.14 Pre-republican jurisprudence, in contrast, was convinced that it was always necessary to use these principles to avoid arbitrary and unjust conclusions to which an interpretation limited to written laws could lead.

The idea was in fact that the law should be adapted not to something external to it (which is to say, to the changeable needs and purposes of society and politics), but to itself, that is, to its permanent and constitutive principles; therefore, if the legislature had failed to expressly sanction these principles, it was the judge's duty to insert them in their proper place. It is worth saying that reasoning like so, often the judiciary was able also to respond to new societal needs, as is shown by one of the examples I gave at the beginning (the employer's obligations towards the sick employee). In the very end, below the many novelties that continuously surface in social life, we find some eternal themes that recur: avarice and egoism, the need for redress and honesty, which law has confronted for ages.15

Italian constitutionalism, imbued with legal positivism, erased this historical memory, and for obvious reasons: this memory says that there is no need for a superior and rigid Constitution to review laws, because Law contains principles, with which laws can be compared and which are in turn internal to the Law, although not positively stated. The damnatio memoriae in which the regulae have occurred16 helps to explain why—when the possibility or necessity of rethinking constitutional principles was felt, when the possibility of an interpretation of the law beyond the text was acknowledged—the principles-oriented constitutionalists, instead of recovering a tradition which had always said that there are principles in Law (principles which provide measures and criteria that aid the search for applicable law); instead of, at the minimum, confronting their thesis with this tradition, were only able to imagine the space of principles as placed above or outside the law (in culture, in

<sup>14</sup>It is important to note that, arguing that the main character that would differentiate the 'new' constitutional principles from the 'old' general principles is the capability of the former of intervene at any moment of the interpretation of the law, and not only in the case of gaps in the law, contemporary scholars refer to the "general principles of law" as they were understood by the pre-constitutional legalistic scholars, who (contrary to the Courts' practice of considering the regulae as general principles) were of the view that general principles are a product of generalization, abstraction and subsequent deduction that starts from the positive normative datum. In other words, the narrative on which the novelty of constitutional principles is constructed (as that of operating differently from the old general principles of law), simply and completely removes the regulae iuris tradition.

<sup>15</sup>Transparently, the Courts' use of considering the regulae general principles was the reflection of a way of thinking according to which the term of reference of law is not the 'whole' but the man, not the 'society' but a sum of individuals and their relations; society changes, but man is always the same, with his limitations, with his passions, vices, abuses and with his resources and virtues. The regulae iuris are rooted in a subjective, non-objective vision of law, as I will state later in referring to Giuliani, and for this reason they bring with them a non-instrumental vision of law.

<sup>16</sup>Bobbio, at the height of the triumph of legal positivism in Italy after the war, blamed them as being "empty formulas" (Bobbio [1966](#page-164-0), p. 894).

society).17 Even the values that these jurists consider 'proper' to Law are so, in their view, because law is an expression of a culture and of a historical time that is characterized by a certain set of values, mainly political; proper to law are the principles connected to the rise of the modern state and expressed by modern political thought (modern 'legalistic' Nullum crimen sine lege is a beloved example, preferred to the Favor rei, far more ancient and general, and stemming from equity: Zagrebelsky [2002](#page-165-0), p. 875). Therefore, values of law were born and discovered outside the law; values that have enervated and shaped the law were not born from its practices and its science, neither from the peculiar problems that Law handles. The merit of principles, according to Zagrebelsky, is in fact to "open the law to the meta-law"—to all that is beyond and outside the law—which is in itself a poor thing. When discussing principles, "the great currents of contemporary juridical thought" (Zagrebelsky [1991](#page-165-0), p. 158)) immediately come on the forefront and rather than juridical, the question becomes philosophical or even political (in the higher sense, of course).

From here we could begin to trace a discrete analogy with what traditionalist, legalistic constitutionalists think: for them, the source of principles is the Constitution, but the Constitution is animated by politics, which is its lifeblood. The difference is that legalistic constitutionalism holds that politics is something that is done through certain actors (i.e. the political parties), and certain procedures (i.e. the legislation) and it is an expression of 'we, the people'; the neo-constitutionalists consider politics and its subjects obsolete as sources of the law and substitute 'society' for the 'people'.

## 2.4 Dworkin's Wrong Examples

In fact, both the advocates of principles-oriented constitutionalism and their opponents have argued that Dworkin is wrong when he considers Nemo locupletari debet ex aliena iactura regula to be a principle; according to them, this is not a good example of principle or maybe not even a principle at all. This brings arguments in favour of those who, as I myself did a few lines above, have doubted that the differences between the two orientations are as radical as they seem.

Luigi Ferrajoli, the main exponent of legalist constitutionalism, argues against the distinction between principles and rules,18 because he believes that most of the constitutional principles are equivalent "to the rules stating the corresponding obligation or prohibition". Ferrajoli points out that in a Civil Law system, such as

<sup>17</sup>In doing so, neo-constitutionalism scholars follow antique methods that had been already discovered during the pre-constitutional era by legal positivistic interpreters convinced that law had to be adapted to a changing society by the means of an historical-evolutive interpretation (Degni [1909)](#page-164-0).

<sup>18</sup>As adopted, he says, by "Alexy, Dworkin, Atienza, Ruiz Manero, Zagrebelsky" (Ferrajoli [2018,](#page-164-0) p. 27).

the Italian one, the problem of Riggs v Palmer would have been resolved on the basis of "absolutely unequivocal rules", not constitutional, however, but codified, and more precisely on the basis of an article in the Italian Civil Code which excludes from any succession, through unworthiness, those who had "voluntarily killed or tried to kill the person whose succession is concerned". Although the problem is posed differently in a Common Law than in a Civil Law system, such as the Italian one, "it is highly questionable that the same solutions imposed by the rules of the Italian civil code was reached by the judges in Riggs v Palmer on the basis of principles (...) the decision was instead based—following numerous maxims on interpretation formulated by Ruthenford, Bacon, Puffendorf, Smith and Blackstone and other maxims of substantive law of the Common Law—on precise legal rules, albeit derived as implicit in other rules, such as respect for the will of the testator, who certainly would not have designated his murderer as his heir (...). But in all cases, it was a matter of applying rules" (Ferrajoli [2010](#page-164-0), pp. 2801 and 2797 and footnote 52).

Gustavo Zagrebelsky is, as mentioned, of the opinion that constitutional principles are inherent to a ductile interpretative practice and that they function as "bridges" between law and "culture". Zagrebelsky distances himself from Dworkin's example, noting that it is "a principle of legal civilization that has been recognized in all legal systems" and also by the Italian Constitutional Court in a ruling on building offences, and yet the one given by Dworkin is not a good example of principle, because "the true 'principle' that sustains this self-styled principle could be expressed as follows: the law cannot allow one to take advantage of reprehensible actions. If the proposition: 'no one should derive a legal advantage from an offence' was a principle, then principles would be only very general rules. In fact, this proposition synthetically contains a sum of simple rules, corresponding to the number of acts defined as illegal in a certain legal system and to the goods of life subject to legal protection such as illegitimate rights, claims and interests" (Zagrebelsky [2002,](#page-165-0) p. 875).19

Law's principles, Zagrebelsky maintains, are often "third or fourth hand, but no less venerable. They can be found in legal traditions proper not to law in general, but specifically to "constitutionalism" (such as the Habeas Corpus principle) or in philosophical traditions (such as the dignity of the human person)"; however, law's principles do not include a prohibition on taking advantage of one's own illicit actions (which however does not lack antiquity, one could say). This Author is available to recognize as principles only those pertaining to the typical places of constitutionalism (the relationship between authority and freedom, which is at the bottom of the very ancient Habeas Corpus principle) on condition that they have

<sup>19</sup>Note that here Zagrebelsky literally reformulates the Nemo locupletari regula in order to deny that it is a principle.

links to that modern genealogy of ideas and theories, in which constitutionalism, considered a distinguishing achievement of modernity, has been shaped.20

In short, Neminem laedere is not a principle because we can derive it not from the traditions of constitutionalism but from the Civil Code (as if it was born with it). Zagrebelsky's conclusions are not that far from Ferrajoli's: even in the eyes of those who believe that constitutionalism is the legal system in which "what is constitutionally stipulated [is] binding and compulsory", as Ferrajoli puts it, Neminem laedere is not part of the principles/rules that characterize a constitutional order, but if anything, it belongs only to a legislative system.

### 2.5 Two Constitutionalist Thesis, One and Only Instrumentalism

The attitude of Ferrajoli and Zagrebelsky towards Dworkin's example, their refusal to recognize Neminem laedere as a (constitutive) principle of Law, and therefore to recognize that the field of legal principles includes logical/ethical criteria, which were elaborated before modernity and without which law would not be such, suggests that both move within similar assumptions. According to La Torre ([2010,](#page-164-0) p. 18), the two Authors, so distant at first glance, have something profound in common, namely the adherence to legal positive concepts.

An education to positivistic ways of thinking certainly transpires in the reading that the two Authors give of the example of Dworkin: Ferrajoli, who refers to the existence in the Civil Code of a norm that repeats the regula, recalls the way of reasoning of the Scholars who, in the Nineteenth century, preoccupied with making the regulae iuris coexist with legalistic assumptions (Cervi [1900)](#page-164-0), affirmed that the regulae could be considered valid only in so far as they had been re-formulated by the Code. Zagrebelsky, stressing that Neminem laedere is only a very general norm

<sup>20</sup>Denying Neminem laedere the status of a general principle of Law, Zagrebelsky adopts the traditional, purely legalistic view according to which general principles are drawn by abstraction and generalization from written norms (see note 14 above): in the positivistic tradition, the Neminem laedere principle has always been considered, in Italy, as the general principle of non-contractual liability, in the limited sense that it sums up many articles of the Civil Code on the matter. On the other hand, the Habeas Corpus principle and Nullum Crimen (which Zagrebelsky acknowledges as principles), are transparently correspondent with the Italian Constitution's provisions on personal freedom and criminal law; being tied to the "authority/liberty" relationship, Constitutionalists are accustomed to recognizing them as analogous to the constitutional principles. Instead, it is not immediate to recognize Nemo locupletior in the Constitution, simply because there has never been the habit of searching for that principle within the Constitution nor to think that it can have constitutional relevance. Nonetheless, this principle can certainly be recognized within the wording the Art. 41 of the Italian Constitution, according to which the freedom of private economic enterprise cannot take place to the detriment of human freedom, dignity and security; and the morality of the market, as I will say later, is certainly one of the biggest aspirations of the Italian Constitution.

(which can mean: 'a norm that can be applied in many cases'; or 'a norm resulting from a generalization of particular rules') adopts the idea that a general principle is nothing more than the result of the generalization of many particular rules, an idea that under the Italian Civil code of 1865 marked one of the strongholds of the advancement of legal positivism.21 By denying Nemo locupletior the rank of principle, Ferrajoli reaffirms the idea that a principle is constitutional insofar as it is written in the Constitution, Zagrebelsky reaffirms that it is constitutional insofar it is contained in a certain cultural tradition, which is that of constitutionalism, as an aspect of modern culture concentrated on the relationship between authority and liberty, power and rights.

Zagrebelsky's is the vision of a jurist who dialogues with the social conscience in order to give it its principles in the light of refined theories of democracy; Ferrajoli's is a vision still confident in an unequivocal will of the Constitution that, in order to become real, needs only to receive objective realization through the political process. Different views, but they coincide where they refer to the vision of law as a technique of social control or for the pursuit of (no matter how noble) objectives, which law takes from the outside, here from the culture of society, of which legal science is the guardian (Zagrebelsky [2002,](#page-165-0) in the end), and there from the Constitution, a political project in the form of norm (Ferrajoli [2018,](#page-164-0) pp. 60–61).22 Rather than saying that the two theses share legal positivistic premises, it would probably be more exact to observe that they have in common an instrumental vision of law, understood as a void, an instrument, a technique, at the service of socio-political needs and purposes (that may or may not coincide with a specific political organization).

The belief in a Constitution by principles or in a Constitution by rules, if something can change in terms of a more or less strict legal positivistic faith, does not modify the premise according to which it is the norm the foundation of law, a form fillable with different content but having always the same characteristic, that of tending to obtain certain results. In this sense, La Torre's critique23 is highly pertinent: both the principles-oriented and the rule-oriented constitutionalism continue to conceive the law as norm. Yet it has been correctly observed that behind the

<sup>21</sup>The thesis, to which I have already referred (see note 14 above) spread after the advent of the Civil Code of 1865, in reaction to the use of jurisprudence to refer to the regulae iuris. In harmony with this thesis Bartole [(1986](#page-164-0) p. 496) still argues that the regulae iuris are equated with general principles as the result of the generalization of particular rules.

<sup>22</sup>"With legal positivism modern politics was born as the government of society through the production and transformation of law by legislation"; after the advent of a superior normative Constitution "politics continues to be the source and the engineer of law" (Ferrajoli [2018](#page-164-0), pp. 60–61).

<sup>23</sup>For both Zagrebelsky and Ferrajoli, La Torre writes, Law is an instrument, "but Law degraded to an instrument ceases to be truly Law and becomes something different" (La Torre [2010,](#page-164-0) p. 18).

difference between principles and rules, the idea of the "statutory norm" dominates (Spantigati [2002](#page-165-0), p. 341).24

In fact, as I have said before, Dworkin's theory was grafted in Italy onto a tradition which was used to considering principles as norms and that had deeply internalized the idea of the instrumentality of law. When law is an instrument (for pursuing the high purposes of emancipation and justice, of course, but this is not the point because an instrument can serve good and bad ends as well), it makes no difference whether law comes from representative politics that implements constitutional principles, or from society and culture that inspire jurists and judges. Even Dworkin, in any case, while distinguishing principles from policies, admits that the distinction can lose meaning in some cases and certainly it does not appear to him as fundamental as that the distinction between principles and rules (Dworkin [1982,](#page-164-0) p. 91). At the very end, to Dworkin too it is not instrumentalism that is the problem, but the monopolization of law in the "rules" set by political actors who, as we know, may not want to carry out the recognition of rights. Oriented to avoid this risk, oriented to obtain a (noble) political goal, his theory is purely instrumental, after all.

## 3 Regulae Iuris in Alessandro Giuliani's View

## 3.1 If All That We Can Know Is What Justice Is Not

The regulae iuris were the focus of very refined studies that the law philosopher Alessandro Giuliani (1925–1997) had initiated in the early 1950s. This considered, it is surely perplexing that mainstream elaboration of Dworkin's thinking in Italy practically ignored the regulae.

Giuliani's is a complex reflection, the themes of which would remain constant throughout his research activity, driven by the concern that law is resolved by a purely instrumental technique, subordinate to "politics, economics, religion, history, reality, and the life of society" (Cerrone [2016,](#page-164-0) p. 996). Legal instrumentalism puts at risk all the values of law—and the very values of living together—starting with

<sup>24</sup>Some of Zagrebelsky's statements are highly significant in this regard: "A law based on principles serves to govern complexity, develops in pluralist societies and is the characteristic of constitutional states. Principles incorporate policy arguments". A principle has a normative character, ex principium derivationes; principles are axioms of the legal order. A principle is an open norm. Although the law by principles, plastic and adaptable, carries with it the risk of casuistry, which threatens the very idea of law as a legal system and equality, in the light of the complexity of today's law and its inspiring principles, flexibility and adaptability are not defects to be corrected, but requirements imposed by the Constitution. A rule becomes a principle with the addition of expression like 'normally' or 'reasonably'. "Principles make up for infinite multiplication of rules that otherwise would be necessary to grasp all the possible variants reflected in particular cases" (Zagrebelsky [2002,](#page-165-0) pp. 890, 871 and 895). These are quite clear expressions in the sense that principles are functional equivalents of norms in the views of an anti-positivistic scholar. Zagrebelsky's theory, imbued with ethical non-cognitivism, appears "relativistic" to Chessa ([2014,](#page-164-0) p. 343).

human freedom. And, Giuliani underlines, contemporary formalisms and antiformalisms, legal positivism and the trends that have opposed it, all share the same logical premise, that of conceiving law as a technique devoid of its own content and being purely instrumental.

According to Giuliani, the reduction to a technique coincides with the detachment of law from the world of human action, which is instead law's source and measure. Giuliani saw in the regulae iuris the examples of "constitutive principles of law" (Giuliani [1957,](#page-164-0) p. 8),25 and in a double sense: in the sense that they express the contents, the ends, or the values or ideals proper to Law (the avoidance of arbitrariness and abuse and the search for the fair reparation of the wrong) and in the sense that they show the way in which the law is constituted (the way in which the law should be constituted, should not cease to be constituted), that is in constant connection with human experience, both in its practical aspects and in its intellectual and spiritual dimension.

The regulae can be described as "observations" but also as "interpretations of behaviors", 26 and the etymology of the word regula is offered by the verb reor: 'I think, I judge, I reason'. 27 Understood in this way, the regulae express the possibility that—through reasoning about the actions and relationships that exist between individuals, that is to say by interpreting them, giving them meaning through the use of logic or of a form of reason, analogous to that which human beings commonly exercise—some constants are identifiable. These constants, rooted in the human experience, do not signal an end to be achieved. They signal an eventuality to be avoided. A rule such as Nemo locupletari debet ex aliena iactura originates from the experience, which shows that if we reward abuses, worse consequences are likely to follow and everyone can understand why: no one, compelled to endure another's arrogance, would ever recognize this as fair. It is important to consider that the

<sup>25</sup>The idea of linking rules as constitutive principles of law to constitutional principles has broad implications, as explored by Cerrone ([2012,](#page-164-0) p. 645; [2016,](#page-164-0) p. 993).

<sup>26</sup>For an example of the traditional definition of the regulae iuris as "the result of a long series of observations" see F.S. Gargiulo ([1905,](#page-164-0) p. 1). This definition is very dear to Giuliani; by the means of the regulae Giuliani intends to show how "the concept of norm is linked to that of human action" (Giuliani [1953](#page-164-0), p. 17): "To Roman Jurists, law [was] a natural reality produced by human actions that could be observed and understood. This is why the concept of norm was completely alien to them. (...). They saw law not as a set of norms or imperatives, but as an interpretation of the juridical aspects of human conduct and action. In fact, if we open the title of the Digest "Regulae iuris" we will not find many conceptual definitions or arrangements, but rather interpretations of behaviour: "Eius est nolle qui potest velle. Non vult heres esse qui ad alium transferre voluit hereditatem" (ib., 119). The Roman Jurist, a metaphor of the 'impartial observer', is a model, for Giuliani, of both the judge and the legal scholar; the latter should share the impartiality of the former.

<sup>27</sup>Reor is also the etymological origin of Ratio. On regula/reor v. Giuliani [(1953](#page-164-0), p. 159 and 197). More frequently, the etymology of regula is instead traced to "regere" (to lead, direct) and the word appears connected to 'rectus, straight, right, correct'; the rule is also the ruler (in the sense of the measuring instrument), the canon, also in the sense of 'standard measure' (Stein [1966](#page-165-0): p. 51 and 144, who in turn accounts for the link between regula and ratio: p. 94). The spread of this second etymology derives from the generalization and retrospective use of the modern concept of norm.

regula, which on the one hand says that it is better to avoid someone from profiting from his illicit act, on the other hand does not always and in any case define what is illicit: ascertaining the practical consequences to which the regula leads in the concrete circumstances is left to the responsibility of those who use the regula.28 This is the "internal morality of law", which consists not in establishing a set of ready-to-use moral precepts that have to be observed, but in engaging all those who are involved in law—claimants, judges, and each person in the mutual relations of societal life—in research aiming to avoid what, as far as we know from experience, justice is not.

### 3.2 Principles of Negative Justice in the Logic of the Preferable

Giuliani refers to the regulae in order to call our attention on the proceeding from which they result. The making of a regula consists in the operation (mental and linguistical, ethical and social) of assigning value, which is to say sense, to human actions and relations (to facts) by other humans that observe these facts and consider their implications and consequences.

Maxims, such as Ad impossibilia nemo tenetur (nobody is held to do the impossible) or Audiatur et altera pars (listen to the other side) or Malitiis non est indulgendum (abuses should not be allowed) are the result of the sympathetic observation that men have made of themselves and of the behaviour of other men, sharing the sense of the common limits of the human condition (which tells us that nobody can do the impossible) as well as the sense of the common limits of the human mind (which warn to us that is always better listen to the other side before making a decision). A human being who investigates the sense of his own actions and of the actions of others feels the consequences that some kinds of actions may probably have. He can see and recognize, also with the help of memory, imagination, and comparison, the probable negative effects of certain courses of conduct and thereby the opportunity of avoiding them. When the Classical Roman Jurist Celsus observed that Malitiis non est indulgendum, he knew that—as experience and imagination both teach everyone of us—if law rewards the abuse or remains indifferent towards arbitrary acts, many harmful, disruptive consequences will arise (resentment, revenge, imitation of the abusive conducts).

Thus, the ancient maxims are to Giuliani the proof of the existence of law's constitutive values, and these are: avoiding the abuse, which is to say searching for justice, equality, certainty by avoiding what, in given circumstances, and after a careful examination, appears a probable cause of injustice, inequality, uncertainty.

<sup>28</sup>The regulae express mere advices, not prescriptions, modern Authors critically maintain. Bobbio [(1966,](#page-164-0) p. 894) condemns for that reason the regulae as useless and pointless. Rather, they express the link between 'fact' and 'law', and this is why they are so troubling to legal positism.

The regulae are principles of a negative justice, transmitted by legal science, which, over the course of time, operating both theoretically and practically, has contributed to shaping them.

Fuelled by the ethics of reciprocity, a regula is posed by an observer which is impartial, but also involved: a human among humans, plunged into the same reality, of which no one is the master.29 The regulae offer then the "argumentative passages" of a negative logic, which is not oriented to constructing the Just and the Good (because no one can know what they are), but to avoiding the abuse and the damage, including that provoked by the lack of that elementary form of control (an elementary form of justice) which is represented by intersubjectivity and fair confrontation. They are as many rules of conduct that speak to the responsibility of the agent, and thereby suppose him or her to be always morally free (capable of doing good or wrong, in that each one is capable of choosing his purposes and the connected means). In this sense, as we will see, the regulae are tuned on the "moral of virtue" and demonstrate that the legal rule cannot be reduced to a mere technical rule.30

This way, the regulae iuris do preserve, in favour of every individual, the difference between being the subjects of a juridical order, and being subjected to whatever kind of collective organization; and the difference between a juridical order and any other organizational 'fact'. The regulae always go together with an intelligent agent who has recognized them, who has used them in searching the better solution in face of contrasting interests, who has chosen if and how to follow them in his action. This intelligent agent is every empirical individual, the sum of them in the course of time: law is the cooperative enterprise resulting from the manifestations of the social and axiological dimensions of the human intellect.

Thus, a regula states what, by the means of an intersubjective exchange, in the course of time, has appeared preferable; in this sense—which is qualitative—a regula expresses the probable and the normal. In its turn, a regula is never shielded from dialectics which verify its relevance and usefulness in better understanding a given problem. Only, someone who claims that the normal (the preferable, the probable) does not apply to a given case is held bound to prove it.31

On the one hand, then, a regula is shaped by reference to concrete actions and behaviours and to their justifications (all vehicles of opinions expressed in words);

<sup>29</sup>It is easy to understand the moral inherent to Giuliani's interpretation of the regulae: law can be seen as a means for the living together among people rather than as a mean for governing, and exerting control, over people. The choice among the two alternatives is in its turn a matter of the 'preferable' and Giuliani, who strongly opposes to instrumental conceptions of law, prefers of course the first.

<sup>30</sup>See on this point, which counters the positivist assumption that juridical norms are technical rules (on which Bobbio [1965](#page-164-0), p. 204) also Giuliani [1974](#page-164-0).

<sup>31</sup>Then, a regula is never true nor false, it is never valid nor invalid: what counts, is whether it is relevant or not to the understanding of a problem (a rule can be "vitiated" in some cases, but valid elsewhere). The regulae iuris are a constant reference in Giuliani's work; for some of his opinions, on which I rely particularly in this article, see Giuliani ([1953](#page-164-0)).

on the other hand, the regula does not prescribe a given conduct, it does not depict a 'precise' case and a 'certain' consequence, expected to be always the same. Instead, a regula is a position taken, a choice, in its turn an opinion: the opinion which appears preferable after a careful, fair debate, a long series of concrete checking and verifications.

The judicial controversy is then the space of dialectics, and the controversy is made possible by a 'commonplace' in relation to which opposite arguments can be confronted with each other. It is a commonplace indeed, that makes diverse opinions capable of mutually speaking. A regula offers a "center of arguments", a "dialogical (topical) agreement", "the substitute of an ontological order", a locus communis: it has to be verified not in the light of the true/false alternative, but in the, more ductile, "porous" logic of the relevance. Then the regula, which is dialectical because its making is rebuttable and justificatory, resists confutation while making confutation possible, thus opening up to change. It accompanies an effort to comprehend, not one of manipulation of reality.

The condition that makes all this possible is what Vico called veriloquium, the mutual commitment to tell one's own subjective truth.

## 3.3 A Subjective Vision of Law

Giuliani stresses that under the Naturrechtsphobie cultivated originally by the Historic School and then inherited by legal positivism, what was at stake was the denial of legal science as a source of the law, and the reduction of jurisprudence to a technique, devoid of inherent constitutive values—according with the aspirations of the new modern rationality, instrumental and calculating, and with the false historicism that sees history as a continuous repeal of the past (Giuliani [1957](#page-164-0)). The essence of normativism (which finds the autonomy of law in its "normative" nature) appears to Giuliani problematic because it is based on the separation/opposition between the "Sein" and the "Sollen". When entirely placed in the "Sollen" sphere, law is conceived as a tool of discipline and reform (manipulation and construction) of the human experience. The authoritarian implications of this are transparent: it has meant sacrificing, in law, the dimension of a form of knowledge (of the human conduct), in favour of the dimension of instrument of reform (of human conduct).

This explains the continuity between legal conceptions which are apparently contrary to one other, such as anti-formalistic and sociological realistic trends that while criticizing the limits of legal positivism, have adopted and magnified the basic positivistic assumption (i.e., the vision of law as technique of social control), more respondent to the needs of society than to those of individuals (Giuliani [1953,](#page-164-0) [1957)](#page-164-0). Admonishing that "the notion of technique belongs to a non-human world" (Giuliani [1953,](#page-164-0) p. 38) Giuliani claims that: "The reduction of jurisprudence to a technique happens every time science is curtailed to being the research of a fact, of a piece of data, of an external and presupposed object. The science in these conditions does not have its own contents or constitutive values: it is the research of a changeable fact external to it. Analogous to normativism (which was a version of legal positivism) are sociological trends, which have searched the contents of law, the contents of the norm, in a social science" (Giuliani [1953,](#page-164-0) p. 120).

The lasting remainder of this, which is to say of an instrumental vision of law, is that all juridical values appear nothing but the contingent (and thereby relative and unstable) fruit of some political trend, e.g. modern liberalism (Giuliani [1957](#page-164-0), p. 48). But: if equality or liberty are not considered constitutive constants of the juridical experience, the alternative is to consider them the transitory expressions of some ideologies.

From here, the importance appears of the "descriptive" (not solely 'prescriptive') character of the regulae: they expresses the permanent connection between "what is" and "what ought to be". To recognize in 'what is' a deontological component limits what can be established in the name of an abstract 'ought to be'. When the making of the law presupposes human nature to be something intelligent—not an inanimate object at the disposal of whatever technique (law as a technique included)—the risk is reduced that Law becomes a completely artificial item, in-human or anti-human. Extremely uneasy with the collectivistic, anti-individual implications of the reduction of law to a technique, Giuliani, with his subjective conception of law, aims to restore the grounding of law in the individual, in the individual experience, action, and feelings, including those aspects of the human nature that are irrational, emotive, passionate and sentimental.

Re-valuing a subjective conception of law means claiming the capability of human beings—of individuals—to feel and think values, and to make them exist practically thanks to "the social operations of the human mind", such as language. By exchanging each other's evaluations and opinions the individuals exchange, choose and create values. This, it is clear, means affirming that the principles of a civil order are the result neither of the will of a legislature nor of the progress of society, but rather of the experience and of the intellectual operations that originate in a myriad of individuals and of relations (also in the dimension of time), all involved in reasoning over the problems of human actions. And it is because "human action is subjective, it is considered in relation to the element of conscience" that it must be "the object of a subjective science" (Giuliani [1957,](#page-164-0) p. 196).

It becomes crucial to be aware that the science of law consists of searching for that degree of objectivity which is possible in a subjective science (anchored to the human action, the realm of opinions). The regulae iuris are an example of this method, in that they are based on "constants and generalizations derived from the observation of experience". This grants law the objectivity "which is possible in the field of the subjective, in the field of opinions" (Giuliani [1957,](#page-164-0) p. 182).

Understanding law subjectively means understanding Law historically, bearing in mind that history is not only a series of stages, outdated by the continuous advancements of "progress": its protagonist is the human being who has, says Giuliani recalling Vico, needs and capabilities—in other words a nature—that recur. In this sense he writes that "if we lose trust in some principles we walk out of the legal experience and therefore out of the human experience" (Giuliani [1957](#page-164-0), p. 35).

## 3.4 Regulae in a World of Norms?

The regula is in Giuliani's view an elementary unit of law, and an extremely valuable one. The regula recalls the constitutive connection between law and the human experience, which is made of conscience and intellect. The 'norm', a modern concept (Orestano [1989,](#page-165-0) p. 74), is instead the moment of the split between the two. It renounces the demanding engagement required by the regula, which is searching for the preferable in the debate of opinions and instead pretends to belong to the field of necessity, of what must be.

Thus, the norm seeks to establish the true nature of things, without offering however any help to the research of it and often puts it even out of sight, because, concentrated as it is on the 'essence', the norm is not able to be a good companion in dealing with qualitative problems, which are the problems typical of Law. The fact is that, differently from the norm, a regula is loaded with history—with human history—and brings with it a great number of human vicissitudes and contingencies. This makes it far more familiar than a norm to these latter. A regula is therefore a more ductile instrument for their understanding.

The regula Nemo audiatur allegans turpidudinem suam (which corresponds to the maxim of equity 'He who comes to justice must come with clean hands') offer a useful example to clarify this. In Italy, in the twentieth Century, the regula was interpreted in a modern key, as if it is was a norm. This pushed forward the need to previously establish in a positive, 'certain' and 'clear' way what is turpis ('shameful'), and it also brought to understand the regula as a 'sanction' against those who perform 'shameful acts'. Dealing with a regula which has (from a rationalistic viewpoint) the severe defect of not establishing exactly what the turpitudes are, and under the pressure of the need to clearly define them—in order not to leave any uncertainty and opacity in the law—the Italian scholars stated that 'turpis' had necessarily to do with sexual behaviour and with sexual behaviour only (Rescigno [1966,](#page-165-0) p. 175). This interpretation was intended to reduce the space of operation of the rule in judicial practice. However, this attempt to define the regula as much and as well as possible ended up denying it any space, given that over time the link between turpitudo and sexuality has appeared steeped in old-fashioned moralism. As a result, the regula, considered aiming to "sanction" non-conforming sexual behaviour, was set aside and no longer used by Courts.

In the light of the logic of the normal and of the preferable, instead, we can never know a priori, once and for all, what is 'turpis'. To ascertain this, we need to make reference to common sense and opinions, as they take relevance in relation to a given act or a concrete demand, always taking into account the circumstances of time and space, all qualitative aspects. Besides, in this logic, it appears clear that the meaning of the regula is not to sanction, punish or impede turpitudines, but to avoid someone gaining advantage from illicit acts. The modern approach forgets all of this.

The point is that by dint of defining the turpis and pushing it into the sexual sphere; by dint of wanting to deal with a maxim as if it was a norm (that is, as the prescription of certain types of behaviour to be avoided, and of the related sanctions), a maxim has been annulled which, if it did express a morality, it was in the civic field, not in the sexual one. In fact, in Italy, the regula was used until the 1900s against corrupt and fraudulent commercial agreements that were deemed harmful for the community. Interestingly, some Authors have recently complained that with the disappearance of the maxim, a principle of "morality of the economy" has disappeared, of which the present times are however in strong need (Breccia [1999](#page-164-0), p. 218).

In the Italian Constitution there are very strong prescriptions according to which rights should prevail on the logic of profit. Nonetheless, the Constitution has failed to oppose the emergence of neo-liberal values. When law must be apt for the times, the "spirit of the time" does condition the interpretation of constitutional principles (and rights).

The paths of In pari causa, a regula transplanted in a positivistic model, contradict Carriò's idea, according to which it is sufficient that the norms of recognition include the maxims, and these will function as principles. In reality, the opposite is quite true: if the dominant attitude is positivistic, even the maxims will be understood as norms, and this will also happen to the principles (and maxims are principles). It is no coincidence that this is the characteristic and the aspiration, in Italy, of legalistic constitutionalism: giving principles a precise, compelling content so they can be handled as norms. But constitutional principles alone, with all the values they are imbued with (as in Italy those of the economic Constitution, concerned with guaranteeing freedom, dignity and human security in the face of profit) are reduced to very little—so experience teaches us—if the adaptive pressures arising from politics, society, 'reality' in their continuous changes, are not tackled from an autonomous point of view. The regulae recall that Law is this autonomous point of view; one that resists the seductive illusion of knowing what justice is (while ideologies, policies, governance models always pretend to know what justice is), and instead focuses on excluding what we know by experience what justice is not. Which is the only thing we know.

### 4 Taking Human Dignity Seriously: Thinking Law on a Human Scale

## 4.1 Rules of Conduct

The main implications of Giuliani's reflection on the regulae iuris concern the relationship between law and morality.

Even in the realm of legal positivism, the 'Dworkinian Turn' has left a softening in the rigid line that once divided Law from Moral; however, still today Dworkin's idea of a "positivized morality" which feeds law's principles troubles the scholars (Chessa [2014](#page-164-0), p. 490 ff.).

Certainly, there is a difference between saying that Law is separated from morality (according to traditional legal positivistic approaches) and saying that it can trace some of its contents in morality (as it is more commonly admitted today). Nonetheless, the two positions have something in common: they both understand morality as a set of precepts, that is to say, of norms, which can be found somewhere outside the law and that are ready to use. This is an 'objective' vision of morality (a set of data that apply to people's behaviour) which mirrors an objective vision of Law. Composed of 'principles' or composed of 'rules', in fact, if objectively understood Law is a set of data presumed to be applied to people's behaviour, and which indicates what 'ought to be'.

The logic of the preferable, which inspires a subjective vision of law, leads to very different consequences as regards the relationship between Law and Moral: when Law is thought of as the field in which free and responsible agents make choices about the better way to act (and therefore about how to better define, or to judge, or to regulate a given situation) the problems of Law and those of morality coincide, and neither Law nor Moral can be reduced to a code of heteronomous ready-to-use norms.

Giuliani advocates this point by elaborating the couple 'Moral of the obligation/ Moral of virtue'. Retracing famous Aristotelian places, he explores the difference between the world of practice and the world of technique. Giuliani goes back to those that, according to Aristotle, are the "two greatest normative manifestations of the practical intellect": art, the domain of poiein (technical-productive knowledge) and prudence, the domain of prattein (active practical knowledge). In the first case (technical-productive knowledge), "a doing has a reference to the results (i.e., a house, a pair of shoes, etc.)"; in the second case (practical-active knowledge), "an action is considered from the point of view of intention, of the use of freedom". The distinction between the Moral of obligation and the Moral of virtue arises on this ground: "the rules of conduct have a different, even opposite meaning, in the field of praxis and in the field of poiesis".

In the first field, the rule is the justification of the action and it presupposes the recognition of an axiological function of reason; in the second case the rule does not appear any different from a technical rule: "an art in fact gives rules that regulate the means and the achievement of ends" (Giuliani [1974,](#page-164-0) p. 558).

In the world of technique, one must know, and one can always know, how to act in order to obtain a certain result, and therefore pre-established rules can and must be followed. In the world of technique, it is sufficient to execute the rule in order to fulfil one's task in a correct way and avoiding blame (e.g., to build an edifice, it is necessary and sufficient to follow the construction rules). Moreover, in the world of technique, rules are subjected to a continuous evolution due to the modification of knowledge, which changes the ways of solving a given problem. Therefore, a single craftsman, or scientist, can make a discovery that facilitates the work or perfects the results and once communicated to the others, all will apply the new discovery because it is simply a question of carrying out a task, of obtaining a given result in the fastest and most effective way possible. This is the field of the Moral of obligation.

Things go far differently in the world of practice, to which the rules of conduct belong. These rules concern how to act in pursuing our goals in situations in which we always are in relation with others. Here the problem dominates, of choosing how to act in given circumstances, which are always special. Our actions are linked to different circumstances of times and places and they involve the subjectivity of each individual. Therefore, there cannot be a prescription that is invariably valid for every action and that ends up being acceptable to all minds, and a Moral of virtue enters into play, because the agent's choice about how it is better to act is always involved.

## 4.2 A Moral of Virtue

When conceived as rules of conduct, moral norms are the rules that each individual gives to his own actions by exercising his sense of the just and of the unjust; which is to say, they are expression of freedom. Giuliani's point is that juridical norms also, being likewise moral norms, belong to the genre of the rules of conduct. On the basis of this point of view he questions a 'scientistic' and 'normative' vision of both Moral and Law, a vision where both are conceived as mere sets of heteronomous prescriptions.

Giuliani recalls that moral reasoning (a non-scientific science of human action) benefits from the transfer—operated by Aristotle—of the legal model of reasoning, "which is transmitted in dissent and controversy", in the moral field. That transfer was made possible by the commonality of problems, with which Moral and Law deal; such a commonality is in turn understandable only by recognizing that Law, as Moral, belongs to the world of praxis, not to the world of technique. In fact, "ethical propositions are characterized by a conflictual situation: must I obey the father or the laws? An ethical problem therefore appears similar to a judicial dispute" (Giuliani [1974,](#page-164-0) p. 561). This is because, Giuliani maintains, both Moral and Law pertain to field of human action, the field of the controversial and of the questionable, where it is not possible to have rigorous and scientific rules; therefore "there is the resort to the model of the virtuous and prudent man. It is not an absolute model, but a research method, represented by the dialectic (..), which is the logic of practice, of how to act" (Giuliani [1974](#page-164-0), p. 561). In fact, "the conclusion of the practical syllogism is not a judgment, but an action or a deliberation. There is no 'right action', absolutely and in all cases; the right action has to be sought in relation to the situation, the circumstances, the nature of things. For that reason, in both Moral and Law, we must be wary of a pre-constitution of conflict solutions" (Giuliani [1974,](#page-164-0) p. 561), which is possible only at the cost of denying the "complex and dynamic structure" of qualitative problems (Giuliani [1975,](#page-164-0) p. 30).

Belonging to the world of praxis, not to the world of technique, law appears dominated not by a morality of the obligation, but by a morality of virtue. This places in the foreground, on the one hand, the intention, the interior and individual moment of moral freedom (the choice on how to act32) and, on the other hand, a set of social operations, those required by the verification of the value of a certain action, which calls into play the opinion of many people, an intersubjective checking. "In a morality of virtue, the discourse around the rules of conduct presupposes the recognition of an axiological function of reason, which is ensured by the practical intellect: the phenomenology of law, in this perspective, starts not from the norm, but from moral dispositions, which are natural in the sense that the word nature had among the Greeks" (Giuliani [1974,](#page-164-0) p. 561). The commonality of juridical rules with moral ones also explains why—and here Giuliani is in strong harmony with Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments—the juridical rules, like the moral ones, are formed independently of the coercion and instead "inductively, through the experience of what our moral faculties approve or disapprove of" (Giuliani [1997](#page-164-0), pp. 38–39). This is transparently the same process, based on the logic of the preferable and realized through the observation and interpretation of behaviours, from which the regulae iuris originate.

The nature of rules of conduct, proper to legal rules, also makes it understandable that the problem of progress is very different in the world of moral choice (and therefore in Law) on the one hand, and in the world of technique, on the other hand. The way in which Mevius has resolved himself in a given affair cannot simply be made known to Caius who will as a consequence act the same way, because Caius is in turn capable of regulating himself in his affairs by himself. Unless of course, we want to suppress the individuality and intelligence of Caius and his competence for himself, that is, the freedom of Caius. This result (the suppression of liberty) is what is obtained when it is claimed that the legal rule is comparable, rather than a moral rule, to a technical rule, that is, when the legal rule is conceived and described as a prescription to be invariably followed in order to obtain a given result, which is what happens when Law is understood instrumentally.

Giuliani concludes that the Moral of obligation "on which opposed positions have met, such as rationalism and utilitarianism, is an aspect of the modern conception of reason, formal, subjective and calculating" (Giuliani [1997](#page-164-0), p. 67). Stressing the relationship between juridical norms and moral norms, both rooted in the subjective dimension, his reflection opposes any temptation to objectify one and others. This objectification has to be avoided because it leads, on the one hand, to equating both Moral and Law to a set of prescriptions exterior to the human, subjective, action and, on the other hand, to making this latter insignificant, and irrelevant.

In fact, a legal rule, when it operates as a pre-constituted solution of conflicts, performs as a technical rule, vehicle and expression of the Moral of the obligation; it aims at supplanting the individual and intersubjective axiological capacities with the predetermination of standardized action models. It is only by holding firm the

<sup>32</sup>The action is "the most significant element of personality" (Giuliani [1957](#page-164-0), p. 151). Giuliani's refusal to qualify law as an objective deontological and preceptive reality, corresponds to an insistent and peculiar emphasis—which is explicitly aimed at safeguarding the value of freedom on the introspective character of the basic concepts of law (ib., p. 158) and of the interior character of human action (ib., p. 152).

affinity of legal rules and moral rules, as practical rules of conduct, that human freedom in the world of Law can be safeguarded, and the connection between Law and freedom preserved, as well as the fundamental value of isonomy. We are all equals, indeed, before the problems of moral choice that law always entails.

It is the logic of the preferable that enters again into play: it suggests that nobody should be denied the capability to subjectively tackle the question: 'how should I act, here and now?', if we want to keep alive, in our living together, the basic conditions of substantial equality and individual freedom.

## 4.3 The Problem of Instrumentalism with Human Liberty

In Giuliani's view, it is therefore in the moment of the reor—that is to say: it is in the freedom and responsibility of choosing the best way to act—that the morality of law dwells.

Today's prevailing ideas on the relationship between Law and Moral appear very distant from this view, but also very similar to each other. As we will see, to a strictly observant legal positivist, the norm must be a rule (in the sense of well detailed and rigorous prescription) precisely to exclude, in the agent, the moment of the reor (of thinking). For a principle-oriented jurist, the moment of the reor is reserved only for a few privileged subjects. If we consider that in the moment of reor the individual axiological capacities that belong to all men are expressed, then its exclusion or limitation in the world of Law raises serious questions when it comes to freedom and equality.

Let us consider the position of legal positivists first; they are the heirs to a tradition that has devalued the regulae iuris as empty formulas for their obviousness (Bobbio [1966,](#page-164-0) p. 894) and as mere advice or imprecise logical directives with uncertain consequences (Crisafulli [1943,](#page-164-0) p. 219).33 Giuliani's regula, the fruit of the individual choice on the best way to act, is evidently the opposite of the idea (which is dear to legal positivism) of the rule as the reason/guide for action, which must be internalized and followed independently of its underlying reasons. Raz's definition of the norm as a "reason for action" is in fact the exact opposite of the Giuliani's regula; and it transfers to every rule the function of social control proper in general to Law, when understood in an instrumental sense. In an attempt to defend law as rule, assuming that law is "essentially an instrument of social control" one Author has recently returned to underline that 'vague' rules—for example 'drive safely' (with prudence and caution)—fail in their objective, of "allowing citizens to coordinate their reciprocal actions". Instead, a precise rule, for example 'do not

<sup>33</sup>Crisafulli, a leading interpreter of Italian Constitutionalism, criticizes the idea that the principle would constitute "a purely theoretical directive, a logical proposition, a thought in short, from which it would be the interpreter to draw, from time to time, the rules of the concrete case" (Crisafulli [1943,](#page-164-0) p. 219. By adding italics I emphasize the positivistic jurist's propensity to exclude from Law the moment of the reor, a point which I will address again later.

exceed 50 km/h', is fully consistent with this objective. Vague norms do not allow citizens to identify promptly and with certainty how they must act because they ask the individual "to seek the solution for himself". These types of rules are bad legal norms, as they do not serve the purposes of Law; instead, they have the different effect of "allocating the decision-making power", and this, for the purposes of control and uniformity which are assumed as the aims proper to Law, is a dysfunctional effect (Civitarese Matteucci [2006,](#page-164-0) p. 708).

With a revealing example the case is made of the secretary to whom the boss says: 'pass me urgent phone-calls only'. And what phone calls are urgent? By formulating a vague rule, the boss allows the secretary the discretion to assess what is 'urgent'. This is dangerous. The secretary's discretion appears on the one hand indecipherable (as if we did not possess certain common notions through which we can determine that a call that warns of an unexpected event is urgent and the one that reminds us of a routine appointment is not) and, on the other hand, threatening for the autonomy of the subject (in this case the employer) who relies on the 'power' of others of evaluating, thinking, judging. This is the reason why 'precise' rules are better, a positivistic lawyer maintains (Civitarese Matteucci [2006,](#page-164-0) p. 710).

This type of advocacy for a rules-made law tells us, in essence, that the norm that expects individuals to make use of their intelligence and sense about what is appropriate and correct in given circumstances is a wrong norm, a flawed one, a non-juridical norm, precisely because it involves the risk of having to trust in each other. The fact is, Giuliani would say, that "in a pre-established systematic the conscience appears to be an element of disorder". However, if the ideal of human conduct from the point of view of a strictly positivistic conception is the secretary, who "is not responsible for the choice because [her] function is purely technical" (Giuliani [1966,](#page-164-0) p. 211), who is governed by very precise rules that suppress her sense, then there is a problem here, specifically with the value of human freedom.

## 4.4 The Problem of Instrumentalism with Equality

Things are not far different when it comes to the ideas of the pro-principles thinkers. They recognize the space of reor—evaluation, and choice—in Law, but reserve it to certain categories of persons, namely constitutional judges or judges in general and jurists, at least the 'cultivated' ones. In this case, the distinction between rules and principles works in the sense that the law is divided between rules, that are "obeyed" and do not refer to the world of values and to the great options of the juridical culture (Zagrebelsky [1991](#page-165-0), p. 149), and principles, of quite another calibre. To understand the principles, one needs to have cultural resources capable of grasping the 'allusions' that a principle makes to the great questions of culture, while in order to understand the rule it is enough to understand its language well.34 When thinking this way, along the basic principles/rules distinction a border runs, which separates the educated and the wise (who interpret principles and dialogue with them) from the ordinary people who just execute the rules: these latter are expected only to understand that they have to obey the rule, whatever it says.

Thus, a two-level Law is outlined: at one level the Moral of obligation operates, which is to say the logic of command, and this is the space in which the standardized and hetero-direct life of the common man moves, basically receiving from rules "the criterion of [his] actions: the rules tell us how we must and must not act in situations foreseen by the rules themselves" (Zagrebelsky [1991](#page-165-0), p. 150). At the other, superior level, the Moral of virtue unfolds. Only those who have to deal with principles can take a position and handle the indeterminate, non-predefined problems of what is just. Principles, therefore, correspond to the sphere of freedom (they enter into play when the situation in which we find ourselves is not predicted by the rule) and they open the space in which we are asked to exercise our freedom (in view of taking a position). To the common man is addressed the strictness of the technical rule, which is the legal norm when understood as a mere "directive proposition of human conduct". To the educated man and the judge only are reserved the moral pleasures offered by the intellectual activity of measuring oneself by the dilemmas of finding the appropriate rule of conduct (normally addressed to others), through the exercise of the sensus recti and iniusti, or, in short, the privilege of holding and exercising the axiological function of the intellect.35

Zagrebelsky's definition of the principle as a "norm without a case in point" evokes a space in which a man asks himself how one should act, what is right and what is not, a space where the man thinks, in a situation that is not predetermined nor typified. Here, but only here, Law rejoins its components of freedom, and

<sup>34</sup>Their scorn towards legal positivism notwithstanding, pro-principles thinkers adopt arguments that were dear to the legalist jurists of more than a century ago in Italy, particularly the most influential among them. Vittorio Scialoja, disdaining the equitable tradition of Roman and common law, saw in it the source of a "seditious equity, which serves to incite the discontent of the people" by highlighting the imperfections of positive law and making people believe that law is a simple thing that everyone can understand (Scialoja [1879](#page-165-0) italics added; see also Cazzetta [2011,](#page-164-0) p. 804 ff.); Nicola Coviello, disparaging the "old hands" who thought that knowing some ancient maxim meant knowing the law, vigorously contested the idea that the principles of law could be interpreted "by any person rather than only by those who have authority over the social group over which the rules must rule"(Coviello [1915](#page-164-0), p. 7, italics added).

<sup>35</sup>A point of view comparable to Fuller [(1963,](#page-164-0) p. 5) emerges: Law, in general, is a system for subjecting human conduct to a system of norms; norms must exist; some limit themselves to laying down the basic rules necessary for an orderly social life. These norms apply the Moral of obligation, they are simply to be performed and clear to everyone ('do not kill'); others require the engagement of a human being "at his best" and do appeal to the Moral of virtue: these are the rules that concern the ideal existence and functioning of the Law and pursue an ideal of perfection. Law, therefore, lies for the most part on the register of the Moral of obligation, with its objective standards and its mechanisms of reward and punishment; where the pressure of duty ends and the challenge of excellence begins, the Moral of virtue intervenes because choices are at stake there (which is to say, freedom).

individuality is relevant. The rule is instead charged with constraint; it is the fenced off space of those who are not free because they receive from the outside the standardized criterion of their action, the indication of what they must do or not do. The rules, Zagrebelsky continues, are things that must be observed and applied mechanically and passively by "thinking automatons" that use simple logical schemes such as syllogism and deduction. Using this expression, 'thinking automatons', Zagrebelsky demonstrates that he perceives the dehumanizing component that underlies legal positivism as well as any instrumental conception of Law as a technique of social control. However, instead of addressing his critique to this dehumanized vision, he accepts it and takes it for granted that the rules (as he understands them), and all that they imply as regards the reification of man, do exist and cannot but exist. Otherwise (and Bentham or Hobbes would surely agree) there would be only chaos, of course. With the Constitution and a principles-oriented Law, rules in fact do remain, even though they are only "one side of Law" (Zagrebelsky 1992, p. 153); to the extent that they remain, the rules are perfectly placed in the same position and role assigned to them by the strictly observant legal positivists. However, one may wonder whether it is apt for a constitutional democracy taken seriously to have an idea of man that accepts that, even only sometimes, an individual person functions as a 'thinking automaton'. The question is whether a world of Law where the many are touched by the rules and the few by principles truly reflects an idea of isonomy.

### 4.5 Rediscovering the Morality of Law: A Matter of Moral Freedom

Legal positivists maintain that a well-functioning Law is one in which individual discretion is excluded, particularly that of the subjects of the Law; therefore, Law should preferably be made up of 'rules'. 'Principialists' argue instead that in Law a sphere of discretion exists, and it must exist, but it is limited to some people. Both are today prone to accept a certain relationship between Law and Moral; but as for the idea that Law has strictly to do with everyone's equal moral freedom, both continue to present problems.

In contrast, and in harmony with his idea of the Moral of virtue, Giuliani theorizes that law should be thought of as "a continuous scheme of delegations" (this is the thesis of the Contributions, Giuliani [1953)](#page-164-0) so that at any moment and for each subject, be it a judge, an administrator, or a citizen, the premise of conscious and responsible (free) action is kept alive and operating. Here the world of Law is inspired by a principle of freedom and equality (even in responsibilities), there by a principle of authority and deprivation of responsibility. Here the world of Law is inspired by a radical principle of isonomy; there authoritarian and asymmetric elements remain. Besides, compared to legal positivism, which at least presupposes the authority that dictates the rules for everyone (and regrets that discretion is somewhat unavoidable in the case of the judge), legal 'principialism' sounds more disturbing, when it is argued that the cultivated man is exempt from the rules and can carry out a dialogue between his peers with principles, thus explicitly reserving moral freedom only to some individuals.

What conclusions can one try to draw from all this? One could be this: the distinction between principles and rules, which took place (especially in Italy) obliterating the historical experience of the regulae iuris (mindful of a subjective dimension of law), grant the role of protagonists of the world of Law only to the great institutional and collective actors: legislators, judges, society, groups, experts. Giuliani calls them the 'Wholes' (totalities, entire): they hold more power or have more wisdom than common people, and (regardless of whether one is an advocate of the principles, or an advocate of the rules) Law is a business reserved to them.

Another conclusion could be this: the distinction between principles and rules does not call into question the instrumental presuppositions according to which Law is a norm established by someone for others (and although there are many types of norms, and some are called principles, the substance does not change). The distinction between principles and rules being nothing but a difference between functional equivalents, it becomes understandable why the definition of both focuses on aspects that merely differentiate them in terms of behaviour, functionality (the rule is rigid, the principle flexible, from the rule we deduce, with the principle we reason). But the word regola/regula recalls a difference of another kind, a qualitative one, which concerns not to what purposes law is useful, but where it comes from and how it takes shape.

To Dworkin, who imagines Hercules drawing the just solution from an objective reality called Law which already contains all answers for all questions, Giuliani replies that "in the absence of a code, the prudent man's behaviour is the rule of conduct" (Giuliani [1997](#page-164-0), p. 23).36 Unlike evoking a world of Law entirely reduced to norms and entirely instrumental to the ends that the Wholes prefigure (and very far from being fascinated by these latter), the regulae remind us that the protagonist of Law is man, with his limits, defects, and with his resources. In their perspective, human actions and relationships do not appear only as the mere object of norms, but also as the sources and measures of the living together, of the values we aspire to. Perhaps, it is only by ceasing to oppose principles and 'rules', and by beginning rediscovering the principles as regulae, that we can renew the link between Law and the value of human dignity, which does not go without taking human freedom and equality seriously.

Silvia Niccolai is Full Professor of Constitutional Law at the Department of Political and Social Sciences, University of Cagliari (Italy). Jean Monnet Chair of European Law 2006–2009, she is a feminist jurist who has dedicated most of her work to developing a critical analysis of antidiscrimination law; on this topic she has authored many articles and essays and she has also edited, with I. Ruggiu, Dignity in Change. Exploring the Constitutional Potential of EU-Gender and Anti-Discrimination Law (Fiesole 2010). In recent years, while continuing this line of research, she has focused on a different topic, the tradition of the regulae iuris in the European legal science, and her book on this subject is currently in print (Principi del diritto principi della convivenza, Editoriale Scientifica, Napoli, 2022). Both lines of research stem from her main study interest, which, developing the topic of the 'Legal experience', dear in the past to a part of the Italian legal theory, aims to criticize the reduction of Law to a superstructure, objective, heteronomous and normative, and proposes of reconceiving the Law in subjective terms, as an expression of human freedom.
