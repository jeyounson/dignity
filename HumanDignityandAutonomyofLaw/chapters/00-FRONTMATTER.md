### Acknowledgment

The origin of this book, notwithstanding the autonomy of its final outcome (and the enriching addition of new interlocutors), is a Special Workshop which took place at the XXIX World Congress of the IVR ("Dignity, Democracy, Diversity") at the University of Lucerne in July 2019 (SW 101, "Law's Autonomy and Concepts of Human Dignity": [https://13278125-e82a-6ee5-6868-a8ae5dadd191.](https://13278125-e82a-6ee5-6868-a8ae5dadd191.filesusr.com/ugd/890d86_15de4f6b7fd74f28b9a6107c5978014f.pdf)filesusr.com/ugd/890 [d86_15de4f6b7fd74f28b9a6107c5978014f.pdf)](https://13278125-e82a-6ee5-6868-a8ae5dadd191.filesusr.com/ugd/890d86_15de4f6b7fd74f28b9a6107c5978014f.pdf). Most of the chapters which comprise it were, in fact, written in the context and under the inspiration of this most memorable meeting, growing (with a significant degree of incorporation of new materials and new developments, but also with important thematic and structural changes) through the felicitous dialogue, and in specific cases also through the intertwined research (to be pursued in other stages), that this meeting effectively set in motion.

Part of the coordination of the present volume was developed as an activity of UCILeR (University of Coimbra Institute for Legal Research), being, as such, prepared within the framework of the following research projects (financed by the Portuguese FCT-Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia): "Societal Challenges, Uncertainty and Law: Plurality | Vulnerability | Undecidability" (Projects I&D UID/DIR/04643/2019 and UIDB/04643/2020).

José Manuel Aroso Linhares

Abstract This introductory chapter aims to unveil the generating series which, despite the plurality of the perspectives and approaches developed in the following fourteen chapters, gives the ensemble an effective contextual plausibility. This generative prime series combines the four main themes mentioned in the title: the concepts of human dignity, the problem of autonomy (and limits) of Law and legal thinking, the connections between human rights practices (and foundations) and the issue of human dignity, the role that the consideration of Law's aspirations attributes to the experience of an autonomous subject-person.

### 1 Introduction

"Wir Neueren haben vor den Griechen zwei Begriffe voraus, die gleichsam als Trostmittel einer durchaus sklavisch sich gebarenden und dabei das Wort 'Sklave' ängstlich scheuenden Welt gegeben sind: wir reden von der 'Würde des Menschen' und von der 'Würde der Arbeit'. (...). Die Griechen brauchen solche Begriffs-Halluzinationen (...) [and] solche Phantomen (...) nicht." (Nietzsche [1872,](#page-17-0) pp. 275–276). This incisive statement by Nietzsche—with its provocative judgement on dignity-worth as being "a compensation" for (if not a hypocritical mask or an insidious lie used in) our world of "slaves" ("behaving thoroughly slavishly" and "yet at the same time anxiously eschewing the word 'slave'")—belongs to the short essay "Der griechische Staat", the third of the "five prefaces to five unwritten books" (Fünf Vorreden zu fünf ungeschriebenen Büchern) that he offered Cosima Wagner (as a birthday present) in 18721 ...—a relatively neglected text (most relevant

certainly for those who follow every detail of the Nietzsche/Wagner saga), with which, however (and certainly not by chance), Michael Rosen, in his indispensable Dignity, establishes a brief and vibrant critical dialogue (Rosen [2012](#page-17-0), pp. 41–46). Is however the recall of Nietzsche's "Der griechische Staat"—whose brilliant Deconstruction-Destruktion does not even spare the acquisition of human rights (treated as "transparent lies" 2 )—productive and adequate when we consider human dignity in its juridical context? I can say that it is. If for no other reason, because the consideration of Nietzsche's arguments is also an opportunity to bring into the arena Jeremy Waldron's well-known distinction between dignity as a ranking status (dignitas) and dignity as value or (absolute inner) worth (Würde)—a distinction we will return to throughout this book.3 As if we were agreeing that ancient Greeks did not require (have not needed or autonomized) the claim to dignity, whilst simultaneously defending that Roman jurists certainly did... and that their unmistakable invention of dignity (albeit experiencing it as a ranking status) is certainly inseparable from the specification of phronesis and humanitas which fed (or have been feeding) Law's claim to autonomy...

And yet, this anticipation and the refutation it justifies are very far from being indispensable. An exercise in Destruktion as brilliant and corrosive as this preface by Nietzsche is well worth it for its own sake, especially in a context like the one we live in today, with its implacable sequence of cultural crises and limit-situations, multiplying perplexities and paradoxes (eine andere unselige Zeit?4 ). In this context, the emergence of a new ensemble of essays on dignity in the juridical context can hardly avoid an autonomous exercise in justification. The reasons to be summoned here are however far from feeding a linear argumentative path. On the one hand, the celebration of the claim or principle of dignity as an irreversible civilizational acquisition (assumed in the Western Text as a kind of an historical absolute) imposes a recurrent topos, with paths and places so intensively frequented (so invincibly crowded) that any new (more or less) celebratory incursion runs the risk of redundancy, pointlessness or banalization. On the other hand, the multiplication of critical approaches—not only addressed to the openness of the signifier as such and the instability of the corresponding contexts of signification and

Triebschen (less than 3 km away from the place where the workshop that gave rise to this book was held...) had recently come to an end (April 1872), announcing the distance and the tragic rupture (which will not take long to happen) between the "philosopher" ("who was also a musician") and the "musician" ("who was also a philosopher") [These formulations are by Kerstin Decker: Decker [2012](#page-17-0), p. 11).

performance but also highlighting the pernicious effects of its proliferation, generating unproductive generalizations, when not empty "shibboleths" (Schopenhauer) [apud Rosen [2012,](#page-17-0) pp. 1, 41, 163], "phantoms" or "conceptual hallucinations" (Nietzsche [1872,](#page-17-0) p. 272)—has stabilized (or deployed) an apparently contrary trend, whose dynamic impulse is precisely a "highly shared (...) animus against dignity" (Rosen) [apud Waldron [2013,](#page-17-0) p. 544]—a kind of theoretical and reflexive hostility demanding the productive overcoming or substitution of the concept (if not its rejection). With the aggravating factor that this hostility may appear (and frequently does!) under the guise of an argument from congruence-Kongruenz (Hans Albert [1975](#page-17-0), pp. 77–79, 93 ff., Hans Albert [1978](#page-17-0), pp. 171–176, 182–186), involving the cognitive Aufklärung that science or scientific practice—treated as an authentic world view (Weltbild/Weltauffassung) or as an autonomous way of life, producing a human world of "problems", "tentative theories" and "criticism" or "error elimination" (Popper [1976](#page-17-0), p. 194)—should (must!) impose on normative choices (its material solutions and its conceptual formulations).5

Bearing in mind the difficulties that this web of arguments imposes, these introductory notes will refrain from developing a unitary exercise in justification, rather admitting that this burden should be attributed to each of the following fourteen chapters and its specific voices. It is in this sense that I may add that these preliminary words will only map the different routes, on one hand acknowledging the transversal intertwinement of four major thematic cores (always present, although sometimes only implicit... and certainly assuming different weights and ways of overlapping and balance), on the other hand distributing the different interlocutors (in direct consonance with those weights and their specific modes of equilibrium) through six different parts or stages.

### 2 The Four Thematic Cores

Two of those thematic cores are already deliberately manifested in the title chosen for this collection of essays: we refer to the concepts of human dignity—explored in their juridical or non-juridical provenances and their corresponding impacts or outcomes on contemporary legal thinking and practices—and to the problem of autonomy (and limits) of Law (but also again legal thinking)—this one as a complex topos, involving not only the opportunity to discuss real or aspired borders with other arenas of discourse and practice (which may be also with alien civilizational horizons and their responses to the problem of social institutionalization), but also as the possibility of rejecting the autonomy-isolation (and the unproblematic claim to

<sup>5</sup> This argument could use for instance bioethical empirical-explicative informations in order to highlight the "usefulness" and squishiness or even "stupidity" of a specific use of the concept "human dignity" and to defend its productive substitution (the positive candidate would be the principle of personal autonomy): see Macklin [2003](#page-17-0); Pinker [2008](#page-17-0); Rosen [2012](#page-17-0), pp. 119 ff. ("Voluntarism"), Waldron [2013](#page-17-0), p. 544, note 4.

universality) justified by legal formalism... and with this the opportunity to rethink Law's specific aspirations (more or less explicitly dynamized through a practicalcultural claim to autonomy) as a decisive manifestation of the Western Text. What about the third and fourth thematic cores? We may say that they are already unavoidable components of the first two, with a degree of relevance, however, that justifies their separate highlighting: we are now considering human rights practices and foundations (in their direct connections with the issue of dignity), as well as the role that the consideration of Law's unmistakable aspirations attributes to the experience of an autonomous subject-person (and the demands that identify his/her position in the dialectical counterpoint with the rethinking of a commune).

Once the thematic material is exposed (almost as if it were a generative prime series), the parts or steps that follow, in their different combinations and responses as if they were building unmistakable development exercises—gain an almost "natural" intelligibility.

### 2.1 Part I. Exploring the "Conceptual Bonds" Between Human Rights and Human Dignity

The three first chapters (Part I) explore the challenge of human rights acquisitions in their conceptual bonds with the representation and experience of dignity.

José de Sousa e Brito's essay ("From Human Rights to Human Dignity and vice versa") draws a significant counterpoint between the democratic pluralism of reasons (and comprehensive doctrines) and the diverse (prudential and non-prudential) intentional configurations of overlapping consensus: so that the transversal argumentative cluster involving the principle of democracy, human rights, dignity and ethical personal autonomy—warranting the conclusion-claims that "[d]emocracy is a requirement of ethics in the law" and that "[t]he principle of human dignity", "articulated in the values of liberty and equality" and seriously taken as "the first normative principle of ethics" ("as received by the law of a rule of law state"), "implies equal liberty for all citizens" and human "equal ethical autonomy"—may for once be treated as a plausible resource regarding a productive re-interpretation of Rawls' political liberalism; this means in fact defending a concept of public reason as an "ethical reason" with "legal" ("ethically justified") "constraints" ("democratic reason is tantamount both to public reason and to legal reason in a modern constitutional state"), as well as requiring that legal forms of argument incorporate (albeit with limits) the warrants and criteria of philosophical ethics ("[t]here is just one good way of reasoning"), which, regarding Rawls, opens up the possibility of taking his proposal (also in the Political Liberalism's stage) not as "an exercise of political rhetoric", but as an authentic ethical approach ("as a true political philosophy" which is "part of philosophical ethics").

The following chapter, by João Cardoso Rosas ("Models of Consensus and Compromise on Human Rights and Dignity"), goes on to explore the human rights legacy and "the underlying concept of human dignity" (or humanity tout court) from the perspective of overlapping consensus. The interpretive capacity of this consensus (with its demanding of two levels of justification) is now however not only explicitly treated as an abstract model—and as such confronted with two alternatives, respectively identifying strict consensus and incompletely theorized agreements (the first one demanding a real, full common ground, the second incorporating the constitutive role of silence or restraint, if not avoidance)—but also explicitly experienced or tested (in counterpoint with the other two models) through a transparent reconstitution of the drafting process or the "argumentative set" (1947/1948) from which the Universal Declaration of Human Rights emerged. This contextualised experience allows the Author to acknowledge the limits of consensus and to highlight the complementary (and yet decisive) role of compromise, as well as (inspired by Rawls, but going decisively beyond Rawls) distinguishing two unmistakably different models of compromise: strategic modus vivendi and moral modus vivendi.

With the essay proposed by Manuel Atienza ("The foundation of human rights: autonomy or dignity?"), the dispute we alluded to supra regarding the alternative dignity/autonomy gains a new intelligibility: on the one hand thanks to the concentration of its tensions on the problem of the foundation of human rights, and on the other hand through the consideration of specific disputes (if not différends) concerning fracturing "bio-ethical" issues (abortion, euthanasia, surrogate pregnancy). The reconstitution of the argumentative webs involved in those theoretical and practical disputes—sustained in a critical-reflexive path that has Kant's "interconnection" between rationale Universalität, Würde and Freiheit, Isaiah Berlin's evaluative pluralism and Dworkin's unity of value as major (and precious) interlocutors—allows the Author to conclude that here we face false (when not misleading) oppositions. This means actually introducing a third term (equality), whilst defending that it is the unit dignity/autonomy/equality (with the diverse combinations and balances it allows) which constitutes the effective foundational core of human rights; this means also and mainly admitting the practical-normative plausibility of "a theory of values" combining "the Kantian and Dworkinian monism" with Berlin's "moral pluralism" (i.e. an experience of practical rationality treating the unity of value as a "regulatory idea", whilst simultaneously "recognizing the existence of tragic cases" and with them a certain "conflicting vision of history and societies" and the critic it allows).

### 2.2 Part II. Exploring the Problem of the Autonomy of Law in the Trends of Contemporary Legal Discourse(s)

Concerning the explicit thematization of the series, with its four announced thematic cores, the second part, as its title instantly reveals, constitutes certainly a parenthesis, albeit an indispensable one. The two chapters which comprise it are in fact directly concerned with the answer to the problem of the autonomy and limits of law (the second component of our series), both of them furthermore developing substantial incursions into contemporary legal thinking—parallel incursions actually (concerned with the counterpoint positivism/non positivism), even though privileging opposing fields. The first, by Eduardo Chia ("Revisiting the Puzzle of the Autonomy of Law In H.L.A. Hart's, J. Raz's and H. Kelsen's Legal Theory"), frequents unmistakably different expressions of the positivistic camp (Kelsen's epistemic normativism, as well as Hart's foundational conventionalism and Raz's exclusive positivism), in order to discuss the role that, concerning law's distinctiveness, is played by the counterpoint between the formalistic claim to isolation or closure and the possibilities (as well as the limits and ambivalences) of a claim to a relative (or relativized) autonomy (all this whilst introducing the concern for "the proper observance of the Rule of Law" as one of the central components of the puzzle). The second, by Jesús Vega ("Constructivist metaphors and law's autonomy in legal post-positivism"), explores a pair of "practical" and "constructivist metaphors" (Dworkin's "chain novel" and Santiago Nino's "construction of cathedrals") as decisive expressions of post-positivism, whilst defending that only the rejection of "value-free neutrality" (taking seriously an effective practical interconnection between legal rulings and "substantive values") will allow us adequately to rethink the issue of the limits of Law today (and this as a decisive step in the consideration of "the autonomy of Law as a matter of value", and as such perfectly compossible with post-positivism).

### 2.3 Part III. Intertwining the Claim to Autonomy and the Concept of Human Dignity

After this indispensable concentration on the issue of Law's autonomy, the intercrossing of the four leading themes returns in force with the following section (part III).

For Ana Margarida Gaudêncio ("Merit, Value and Justification: Human Dignity vis-à-vis Legal (Inter)subjectivity – The Autonomy of Subjects Within the Autonomy of Law"), the reflexive opportunity that this overlapping stimulates is certainly considering the implications that diverse (when not heterogeneous) conceptual and aspirational experiences of human dignity (as merit, value and justification) are supposed to have when we discuss the issue of the foundations of law (in their external-ontological or internal-practical-normative configurations), as well as when we explore the signifier autonomy both considering Law's claim to distinctiveness (the autonomy of law) and the corresponding specification of humanitas, this one with regard to a dimension (or pole) of equal self-determination and free participation (the autonomy of suum as a dimension of legally relevant personhood)—a reflexive path which involves an intricate skein, challenged (when not aggravated) by the unanswered questions posed by the multiplication of subjectivities, the politics of multiculturalism or the emergence of post- and trans-humanisms.

The same intercrossing, privileging the issue of the limits from the perspective of the counterpoint Law/Morals, allows Silvia Niccolai ("Between Principles and Rules. An itinerary around Law's Morality and Human Dignity") to overcome both formalistic isolation and pragmatic instrumentalism, in order (with Dworkin, but very specially with Alessandro Giuliani) to rethink the specificity of legal principles: this means in fact rejecting the methodological treatment of principles as norms—and with it the binomial norms as principles/ norms as rules (which highlights 'principles' and 'rules' as functional equivalents of the 'norm')—, whilst assuming their constitutive intrinsic identity as centres of argumentation (decisive "argumentative passages" of a negative logic), giving continuity, in the context of an authentic practical rationality subject/subject, to the precious tradition (never truly surpassed) of the regulae iuris (the authentic "internal morality of law"). It is the attention paid to these principles of a negative justice and to their practical consonance with concrete circumstances (corroborating "the existence of law's constitutive values", as well as developing an effective "logic of the preferable") which gives human dignity its unmistakable juridical sense ("taking human freedom and equality seriously"), whilst recomposing the subjective dimension (of human and personal autonomy) which the experience of Law cannot (and should not) reject.

The prime series (with its four pillars) is still fully present in António Cortês' chapter ("The Legal Meaning of Human Dignity: Respect for Autonomy and Concern for Vulnerability"), the decisive interlocutor being now Kant and his determination of worth-Würde ("raised above all price"), seriously taken as "the starkest, albeit insufficient, 'starting point' for understanding human dignity". Justifiably understood and experienced in its primordial categorical configuration, the principle of dignity is thus significantly explored as "the basis (...) in the light of which the whole system" of "human rights" (and "constitutional rights") "should be interpreted", as well as the "cornerstone that defines the limits and frontiers of the law as a whole". The reinvention of two Kantian diverse binominal resources (distinguishing on the one hand innere and äußere Freiheit, and opposing on the other homo noumenon and homo phaenomenon) justifies in turn a productive intertwining between dignity and vulnerability and this as an opportunity to rethink some contemporary decisive limit-problems in biolaw, such as voluntary euthanasia and human genetic engineering (which means once again discussing the boundaries of Law).

The following fourth and fifth parts are constructed as explicit dialogues.

## 2.4 Part IV. Dialogues with Emmanuel Levinas

The fourth part, including the essays by Susan Petrilli ("The Double Sense of the Law-Dignity Relationship in Emmanuel Levinas") and Augusto Ponzio ("Human rights, rights of the other, and preventive peace. A Levinasian perspective"), develops a conversation piece in two rounds with Levinas's ethics of alterity, re-read in the light of global semiotics, if not directly from the perspective of semioethics (the fruitful research field, combining semiotics and ethics, that both Authors opened up): whereas Petrilli, reconstituting the "dual law-dignity relationship", as well as a productive overlapping between the problems of dignity and singularity, develops a global systematic approach of Levinas' proposal—attentive to the counterpoint between conditioned and unconditioned responsibility, as well as to the challenges that the "comparison between incomparables" and the "arrival of the third" (whilst involving thematization) relentlessly pose, but no less sensible to the abolishment of the "time of the human" that the digital world implacably brings ("responsibility for the other cannot be enclosed in a general rule, in an algorithm")—, Ponzio focuses on the issue of human rights, which means not only exploring the expected constitutive counterpoint between rights of identity (of the "closed self") and rights of the other man (those which demand absolute and infinite otherness as an asymmetric relationship "in the face-to-face position"), but also introducing the decisive (and less well-known) topos of peace, this time in order to distinguish the peace which is functional (or intrinsic) to war and the so-called preventive peace. Only the last, certainly because it presupposes the felicitous mediation (the indispensable "way") of "a bad conscience" (a bad conscience which suspends "the rights of identity" and introduces "non-indifference for the other"), allows in fact the "full openness" and the "responsibility without alibis" (the feeling fear for the other) that effectively liberate us "from the world of war"—which means treating "primordial peace" (identified with the "original responsibility for the other man") as the "real foundation of the rights of man".

## 2.5 Part V. Dialogues with Jeremy Waldron

The fifth part brings into the full glare of the spotlight an interlocutor who, regarding the problem of dignity in its legal context, is certainly today an inescapable point of reference: Jeremy Waldron. The first of the two chapters, written by Julie Copley ("No argument: human dignity and the making of legislation") focus on the exercise of legislative potestas (and its specific virtues, if not aspirational features) whilst discussing the empowering and the limiting effects that, concerning that authoritypotestas, the conceptualization of dignity (not only as the dignity of legislation, but also as the dignity of the citizen-socius and his/her equal ranking status) effectively produces in a modern constitutional state. Aroso Linhares's chapter ("Is Dignity a Non-contingent Autonomously Juridical 'Idea'? A Conversation Piece with Jeremy Waldron") explores in contrast the well-known distinction between dignity as a ranking status (dignitas) and dignity as value or (absolute inner) worth (Würde), with the avowed purpose of re-reading (if not misreading) it, which means highlighting an experience of Law concentrated upon the microscopic invention of intersubjective comparability, as well as exploring "the constitutive dialectics between the endogenous components of Law's project and the contextual and environmental conditions and resources which feed its performance".

### 2.6 Part VI. Exploring Human Dignity in the Boundaries of Law

The two essays which comprise the sixth and last part have in common the treatment of juridically relevant dignity from a perspective which deliberately places us on the borders of Law and legal discourse.

The first of these essays is by Orit Kamir ("Israel's War on the Hegemony of its 'Basic Law: Human Dignity'") and explores the ambivalent connection between the legal consecration of dignity (and human rights) and the issue of Law's autonomy. The leading question ("Does the statutory recognition of dignity promote or undermine Law's autonomy?") is not however considered within the walls of the academic house, but rather it mobilizes the experience of a very specific political-social and practical-cultural context (Israeli society in the first two decades of the twenty first century). It is this contextualization, complemented by an eloquent exercise of law in film (Noam Kaplan's Manpower), which allows us to pay attention to the différend at stake as a direct (unequivocal) "clash" between political-ideological agendas (between a "liberal" universalistic human dignity-based agenda, and a rightwing national honour-based one), whilst acknowledging that this clash also reflects an irreconcilable understanding of the constitutive roles attributable to jurisdictional and legislative powers.

In the concluding chapter, by Brisa Paim Duarte ("Images and Counter-images of humanitas: A Jusaesthetic Approach to the Problem of Law's Normative Validity - Beyond the Blindness-and-Sightedness Polarity"), the signifier dignity is apparently absent. Only apparently, however, since the corresponding plausible signifieds, without renouncing their troubling plurality (but rather highlighting their differences and the instability of their contexts), emerge in force under the mask of another signifier: humanitas. Certainly not by unjustified whim or contingent chance, but quite simply because the discussion takes now place in another (alternative) border territory, this one illuminated by the conclusions-claims of a certain jusaesthetic approach: an approach which for once is not resigned to offering up the expected external perspective, but which rather aims to develop an internal critical alternative, able to assert autonomous law "as a particular experience of sightedness" and as such admitting that "amplifying law's conditions of visibility" means "reinventing humanitas as a specific juridical image and practical artifact". Isn't this precisely recovering in full the transparency of the generative series (with its four thematic cores). whilst involving a plausible Law & Visual Jurisprudence's approach? We can say it is.
