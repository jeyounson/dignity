Abstract The role(s) nowadays undertaken by the concept of human dignity, pervasively proposing it as the essential foundation of law, in its many significances and conceptions, involve specific underpinning references when it is specifically considered within legal subjectivity and intersubjectivity, whether acknowledged as an axiologically external foundational reference ascribed to law, on the one hand, or, on the other hand, as an essentially normative internal foundation conferred by law. Underlining the normatively constitutive possible projections of the latter reference, the presupposition of reciprocal recognition of human dignity between persons requires a critical and genealogically inquiry into its meanings and substances, regarding the different senses of human dignity, from its distinctly deontological and axiological avowals as merit and as value to its discursively critical conception (s) as justification (mostly from Plato, Aristotle, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Immanuel Kant and George W. F. Hegel, to Charles Taylor, Jeremy Waldron, Stephen Riley, Jürgen Habermas and Rainer Forst).

### 1 Contemporary Role(s) of Human Dignity and Law

The roles nowadays undertaken by the concept of human dignity, pervasively proposing it as the essential foundation of law—in its many significances and conceptions, involve specific underpinning references when it is specifically considered within legal subjectivity and intersubjectivity—, whether acknowledged as an axiologically external foundational reference ascribed to law or as an essentially normative internal foundation conferred by law. Underlining the normatively constitutive possible projections of the latter reference, the presupposition of reciprocal recognition of human dignity between persons requires a critical and genealogically inquiry into its meanings and substances, regarding the different senses of human

dignity, from its distinctly deontological and axiological avowals as merit and as value to its discursively critical conception(s) as justification. Exploring such an approach, the discussion on the meaning(s) of human dignity in law involves the possibility of ascribing a normatively constitutive character to the reciprocal recognition of human dignity as the background of legal (inter)subjectivity. Thus, questioning the signification of a person as a legal subject (not only in its legal personality, but also in its legal personhood, whilst considering other possible legal subjects); and, above, and beyond, the assertion of an axiologically constitutive autonomous normative foundational conception of law as the constitutive background of that specific human dignity in a juridical sense. And, therefore, reflecting on the legal meaning(s) of the autonomy of subjects (and the inevitably corresponding dialectic between liberty and responsibility) within the autonomy of law.

In fact, plentiful meanings are nowadays ascribed to human dignity, as if it could constitute a universal foundation—or several universal foundations—of being human, of a human being, and of human relations. Of course, the roles undertaken by human dignity, whilst proposing it as the essential foundation of law, involve, in their many significances and conceptions, specific underpinning references. And, as it is considered within legal subjectivity and intersubjectivity, questioning its meanings leads, at least, from the understanding of an axiologically external foundational reference ascribed to law, on the one hand, to, on the other hand, an essentially normative internal foundation conferred by law.

Despite the plurality of the understandings of subjectivity and of the roles nowadays ascribed to law, the foundation invoked of law is increasingly resting on human dignity as a secure value, and on human rights, and has its natural, necessary, and universal consequence. Such a specific concern, within the philosophical foundations and the meaning of law as a social normative order, requires a reflection on the pertinence and meaning(s) of human dignity, from a genealogical point of view—as merit, and/or as value, and as justification—, and from a legal theoretical approach—by questioning human dignity as an indispensable feature for establishing human subjects as legal subjects. Therefore, this reflection will crucially approach to the construction of human dignity in law, starting from the idea of law and moving towards intersubjectivity—which means not only considering human dignity as a feature absorbed by law, but also, and mostly, considering juridical human dignity as a human feature created by law. This reflection encompasses, then, three main steps: firstly, acknowledging the contemporary roles of human dignity in law; secondly, discussing the historical and contemporary meaning of human dignity as merit, and/or as value, and as justification...; and thirdly, stating a proposal for the meaning and role of human dignity within law, beyond an ahistorical-natural given value, rather as a historical-cultural axiological construction...

Even though human dignity is a signifier with so many meanings (and contents) as the civilizational experiences considered—since the generic category of human dignity will only make sense if substantially densified according to the context (Marques [2009](#page-131-0), p. 566)—, only the reciprocal recognition of that dignity—understood as a constitutive element of juridical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, and of its actual realization—may be the basis of a materially autonomous meaning of law (Neves [2002](#page-131-0), pp. 869–870). That is a crucial statement to this reflection: affirming law as a normative validity—and that it is not enough to affirm that this validity will be that which, in each concrete historical community, might be...—, bearing in mind the contributions of other normatively relevant dimensions of practice, which confer to it the quality, the legitimacy and the role of a regulative order and a critical instance of social praxis (Neves [2008a,](#page-131-0) pp. 10–14; Neves [2008b](#page-131-0); Linhares [2008](#page-131-0), pp. 426–427; Neves [2013](#page-131-0)).

## 2 Human Dignity and/in Law

### 2.1 Human Dignity as a Value: From Merit to Honour, Recognition and Statute/Rank

Genealogically, as Umberto Vincenti points it out, human dignity has been presented as a crucial value in human relations, though first as merit, and only ab initio, i.e., potentially, as an intrinsic feature. Distinguishing, in fact, four meanings of dignity: dignity as a virtue, as an acquired merit, as an intrinsic quality/feature, and as titularity of rights (Vincenti [2009](#page-131-0)). Beyond the etymological origin of the term, in its Greek origins, that which the Romans afterwards called dignitas already meant a virtue of character, of action, referring to acting virtuously, and assigned to those who acted so—and then, as axía and axíoma (Vincenti [2009](#page-131-0), I. "Dignità e valore", pp. 7–40, 7–10; Poisson [2004](#page-131-0), pp. 43–48). It would be understood not as an expression of a right, but as a reward for the accomplishment of duty, as the merit attained by some action—therefore, in Seneca, for instance, dignity could be pervasive, as referring to acting right. Dignity would, then, constitute a feature of every person—in different ways—, but not depending on being a person, rather resulting from action, as Aristotle already had pointed out in Nicomachean Ethics, and, still before, Plato had considered in The Republic (Vincenti [2009](#page-131-0), pp. 10–18; Plato [2000](#page-131-0); Aristotle [1984](#page-130-0), 4.3. 1123b). In Roman terms, then, dignity as merit is understood as a part of the Greek axía, and also a part, an initial and very relevant part—for instance, in Ciceron, especially in De officiis—, of dignitas (Vincenti [2009](#page-131-0), pp. 12–22; Giltaij [2016](#page-130-0), p. 233; Ciceron [1956](#page-130-0)). And, so, differently from the, also polysemic, existimatio—meaning much more than reputation (Giltaij [2016](#page-130-0)).

Essentially, therefore, dignitas leads to auctoritas. And justice, measured from this sense of axía, or dignitas, would mean suum cuique tribuere, and, so, not strict equality, but some distribution referring to each one's merit—a first reference to the juridically specific meaning of dignity (Vincenti [2009](#page-131-0), pp. 18–27). And the influence of Christianity, though not strictly original, was crucial to the broadening of the assumption of human dignity to being considered a pervasive feature, ascribed to each human purely by being human (Aroney [2021](#page-130-0), p. 1212)—as, for instance Pico della Mirandola stated in 1486, in his Oratio de hominis dignitate (Mirandola [1486](#page-131-0)). Therefore, being human, human being, and human dignity are different expressions with many distinct possible meanings—so, human dignity may not be constructed only by considering humanitas in a biological sense; it requires humanitas as a cultural feature. And it may be, therefore, pervasive only in a formalistic and nominalistic sense, though not, perhaps, in its substantial and normative content.

Contemporarily, the multiplicity of subjectivities, leading to the multiculturalism as a consequence of the need to pacify intersubjectivity, in a combination of differentiation and the demand for recognition, 1 is illustrated by the conclusion stated by Charles Taylor that non-recognition or misrecognition constitute a form of harm. 2 In this sense, the concerns for identity and recognition in the Modern Ages result from the combination of two historical changes: on the one hand, the tendential replacement of the Pre-Modern concept of honour by the modern concept of dignity—as a result of the abolition of social classes and of the establishment of democratic regimes3 —and the consequent development of the notion of authenticity, 4 as the novelty of authenticity in Rousseau, and then in Hegel, with the development of the notion of recognition (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) pp. 35–36; Hegel [1807,](#page-130-0) chapter 4); and, on the other hand, the development of the Modern notion of identity, and the resultant politics of difference (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 38). Concerning the first

<sup>1</sup> "A number of strands in contemporary politics turn on the need, sometimes the demand, for recognition. The need, it can be argued, is one of the driving forces behind nationalist movements in politics. And the demand comes to the fore in a number of ways in today's politics, on behalf of minority or "subaltern" groups, in some forms of feminism and in what is today called the politics of "multiculturalism".

The demand for recognition in these latter cases is given urgency by the supposed links between recognition and identity, where this latter term designates something like a person's understanding of who they are, of their fundamental defining characteristics as a human being." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 25).

<sup>2</sup> "Nonrecognition or misrecognition can inflict harm, can be a form of oppression, imprisoning someone in a false, distorted, and reduced mode of being." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 25).

<sup>3</sup> "We can distinguish two changes that together have made the modern preoccupation with identity and recognition inevitable. The first is the collapse of social hierarchies, which used to be the basis of honor. I am using honor in the ancien régime sense in which it is intrinsically linked to inequalities. (...)

As against this notion of honor, we have the modern notion of dignity, now used in a universalist and egalitarian sense, where we talk of the inherent "dignity of human beings", or of citizen dignity." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) pp. 26–27).

<sup>4</sup> "Democracy has ushered in a politics of equal recognition, which has taken various forms over the years, and has now returned in the form of demands for the equal status of cultures and of genders.

But the importance of recognition has been modified and intensified by the new understanding of individual identity that emerges at the end of the eighteenth century. We might speak of an individualized identity, one that is particular to me, and that I discover in myself. This notion arises along with an ideal, that of being true to myself and my own particular way of being. Following Lionel Trilling's usage in his brilliant study, I will speak of this as the ideal of "authenticity"." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) pp. 27–28). "The ideal of authenticity becomes crucial owing to a development that occurs after Rousseau, which I associate with the name of Herder — (...) as its major early articulator, rather than his originator. Herder put forward the idea that each of us has an original way of being human: each person has his or her own "measure"." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 30).

change, identity and recognition would constitute not monological, but dialogical, categories, in opposition to the assumptions of rationalism (Taylor [1994](#page-131-0), pp. 32–34). Moreover, egalitarian recognition, typical of a democratic context, manifests the recognition of identity and authenticity (Taylor [1994](#page-131-0), pp. 36–37) in the distinct intimate and public recognition spheres, 5 meaning universal recognition, based on equal dignity, 6 focusing on Rousseau and Kant.7 Concerning the second change, in the politics of difference, recognition is based on a principle of universal equality, presupposing the exposure of discrimination8 —gathering in Kant the dignity of the person as a universal human potential, which inspires Taylor in the assumption of the identity of the person in the politics of difference. 9 But there are many perceptions of human dignity and of its relations to law. So, in a different vein, Jeremy Waldron intends human dignity within law as a specific statute, or rank: 10 and, as such, both as a universal characteristic of humans, and, eventually, simultaneously as the content of rights and a foundation for rights11—thus distinguishing the meaning of dignity in the quality of principle of morality and principal of law and asserting it, in this latter sense, as a statute or rank conferred by law. This statement presupposes a divergence of the meaning of dignity as status from Kant's perspective on dignity as value, by emphasizing the distinction between the meaning of value and that of worth, and of the distinction between them within the meaning of

<sup>5</sup> "And so the discourse of recognition has become familiar to us, on two levels: First, in the intimate sphere, where we understand the formation of identity and the self as taking place in a continuing dialogue and struggle with significant others. And then in the public sphere, where a politics of equal recognition has come to play a bigger and bigger role." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 37).

<sup>6</sup> "With the move from honor to dignity has come a politics of universalism, emphasizing the equal dignity of all citizens, and the content of this politics has been the equalization of rights and entitlements." (Taylor [1994](#page-131-0), p. 37).

<sup>7</sup> "The politics of equal dignity has emerged in Western civilization in two ways, which we could associate with the names of two standard-bearers, Rousseau and Kant. This doesn't mean that all instances of each have been influenced by these masters (though that is arguably true for the Rousseauean branch), just that Rousseau and Kant are prominent early exponents of the two models." (Taylor [1994,](#page-131-0) p. 44). See also Vincenti ([2009)](#page-131-0), pp. 27–40.

<sup>8</sup> "With the politics of equal dignity, what is established is meant to be universally the same, an identical basket of rights and immunities; with the politics of difference, what we are asked to recognize is the unique identity of this individual or group, their distinctness from everyone else." (Taylor [1994](#page-131-0), p. 38).

<sup>9</sup> "The politics of equal dignity is based on the idea that all humans are equally worthy of respect. (...) For Kant, whose use of the term dignity was one of the earliest influential evocations of this idea, what commanded respect in us was our status as rational agents, capable of directing our lives through principles. Something like this has been the basis for our intuitions of equal dignity ever since, though the detailed definition of it may have changed." (Taylor [1994](#page-131-0), p. 41, referring to Kant [1785](#page-130-0)).

<sup>10</sup>"I will actually argue against a reading of the dignity idea that makes it the goal or telos of human rights. I think it makes better sense to say that dignity is a normative status and that many human rights may be understood as incidents of that status." (Waldron [2012,](#page-131-0) p. 18).

<sup>11</sup>"A more interesting duality of uses has to do with the distinction between dignity as the ground of rights and dignity as the content of rights." (Waldron [2012,](#page-131-0) p. 18). See also Waldron [(2015](#page-131-0)).

dignity as Würde. In Waldron's view, the historically constructed notion of human dignity rests on the Classic and Christian cultural notion of dignity, as a specific feature of human beings, both in morality and in law.12 And, still differently, in Stephen Riley's view, law must be limited by human dignity, and this latter cannot be understood without the former, which means that human dignity has normative value and content, establishing a very tight relationship with law (Riley [2018,](#page-131-0) [2019)](#page-131-0).13

In fact, the reflection proposed here focuses on the differences between the signification of human dignity as merit and the usual consideration of human dignity as value, which requires the presupposition of Waldron's notion of rank or statute since the word value assumes many meanings in the discussion on dignity, which, consequently, often become undistinguished. Therefore, such a reflection on the meaning(s) and content(s) of human dignity, from a juridical-philosophical point of view—and, thus, directly posing the question of the foundation, the meaning and the content of human dignity in and for the law—, requires questioning the distinction of moral, philosophical and constitutional understandings of human dignity, as well as the understanding of the foundation and of the constitution of the meaning of juridical subjectivity and intersubjectivity. And, concomitantly, it establishes the material foundations for the reciprocal conference of the quality of subject of law and the corresponding delimitation of the domain of relevance of the law itself—and specifically asks in which terms the plural meanings of human dignity constitute value(s) and/or right(s), both in terms of the reasoning and of the institutionalization of the juridicity.

Beyond merit and/or value, but also within these two notions, and on the cultural and philosophical heritage they represent—mostly between Kant's understanding of dignity and Hegel's proposal on recognition—, from practical-axiological to theoretical-procedural approaches, human dignity is increasingly seen from several different perspectives, which can exemplarily be stated in two main outlines: as a universal or a regional intrinsically formal-procedurally presupposed or constructed feature of human beings, on the one hand; and/or as a universal or a regional intrinsically substantial-axiologically presupposed or constructed feature of human beings, on the other hand. This means admitting human dignity as a signifier with multiple signified possibilities (meanings) and contents—considering that it will make sense only if it is substantially densified in space and in time, as, after all, Aharon Barak also assumes: "Indeed, any understanding of human dignity is based upon a given society's understanding at a given time, which might change as times

<sup>12</sup>""Würde," in sense of the passage in Kant's Groundwork, expresses a type of value or a fact about value. "Dignity," by contrast, conveys the idea of a type of status that a person may have." (Waldron [2012,](#page-131-0) p. 24).

<sup>13</sup>"Law must be understood as limited by the demands made by human dignity. Conversely, human dignity cannot be properly understood without clarifying its interaction with legal institutions and legal practices." (Riley [2018,](#page-131-0) Preface). "The most general form of this question of foundations is whether and how human dignity is foundational (i.e., necessary) for certain laws and, conversely, if and how law is foundational (i.e., necessary) for human dignity." (Riley, [2019,](#page-131-0) pp. 439–440).

change. Therefore, I do not accept the opinion that human dignity is an axiomatic, universal concept." (Barak [2015](#page-130-0), p. 6). "Human dignity as a social value reflects human dignity's place among the values of a given society at a given time." (Barak [2015](#page-130-0), p. 12).

### 2.2 Human Dignity as a Dialogical-Procedural Feature of Human Beings

Surrounded by such a cultural and historical scenario, in a twofold theory, Rainer Forst's concept of human dignity as reason-giving represents an illuminating example of how the understandings of intersubjectivity may change within the corresponding understandings of human dignity, from an axiological-substantive value to a discursive-procedural right to justification. Criticizing transcendent and religious perspectives on human dignity, Forst proposes what he calls a "historically reconstructed" concept of human dignity—mostly inspired in Ernst Bloch's conception—, as "a context-transcending normative understanding of the person as the basis of fundamental moral claims and as the 'ground of critique' of social norms". 14

Such a proposal requires an essential (core) notion: the notion of person. And person as a specification of human being: "(...) the person as a justifying being, as a being who uses and 'needs' justifications in order to lead a life 'fit for human beings' among his or her fellows". 15 So, being a person presupposes, in this approach, first, to be a human being, and, second, to be endowed with a right to justification meaning "(...) a right to justification of all actions or norms that affect them in morally relevant ways – and acknowledging that every moral person has a duty to provide such justification". 16 Such an approach presupposes understanding societies as orders of justification, still considering their "complex and plural contexts and narratives of justification", and pointing out that persons, as "normatively

<sup>14</sup>"Contrary to the view that any answer to this question must rely on a transcendent, religious justification, (...) I will make a plea for a historically reconstructed, yet context-transcending normative understanding of the person as the basis of fundamental moral claims and as the 'ground of critique' of social norms". (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 966). See also Bloch ([1987)](#page-130-0).

<sup>15</sup>"This involves a notion of the person as a justifying being, as a being who uses and 'needs' justifications in order to lead a life 'fit for human beings' among his or her fellows." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 966).

<sup>16</sup>"Recognizing this dignity means seeing persons as beings who are endowed with a right to justification of all actions or norms that affect them in morally relevant ways – and acknowledging that every moral person has a duty to provide such justification. In a reflexive turn this right is to be seen as the most basic right because it is the presupposition for being able to orient oneself autonomously in social space as a "space of reasons"." (Forst [2011](#page-130-0), p. 966).

independent beings within the space of reasons", are 'critical' beings who never comply with just one given order of justification". 17

Forst presupposes human dignity as "(...) a status that applies to human beings as human beings, regardless of their specific identity", 18 not considered in terms of basic needs or substantive social condition,19 but as an expression of selfdetermination, of reciprocal respect for the autonomy of each other, or, in other words, specifically, as a right to justification—referring to Kant, as the "worthiness of every rational subject to be a law-giving member in the kingdom of ends". And, therefore, a concept of human dignity with moral and political roots and consequences in its construction and content,20 considering each person as a law-giving member in a community.21 Consequently, all human beings would have an "unconditional right to justification", as a "basic right on which all other basic rights are founded". The right to justification would, then, be the first human right and the basis of all other human rights, so that: (1) "to possess human dignity" would mean to be "an equal member in the realm of subjects and authorities of justification", independently of the capacity to actively exercise the capacity of justification; (2) "to act with dignity" would mean being "able to justify oneself to others"; (3) "to be treated in accordance with this dignity" would mean "being respected as such an equal member"; (4) "to renounce one's dignity" would mean "no longer regarding oneself as such a member but as inferior"; (5) "to treat others in ways that violate their dignity" would mean "regarding them as lacking any justification authority". 22

<sup>17</sup>"To understand societies as orders of justification in this sense is not to imply that they do not contain complex and plural contexts and narratives of justification, but it does mean that basic claims exist which point beyond these contexts and call for a new order. Conceiving of ourselves as being normatively independent within the space of reasons makes us into 'critical' beings who never comply with just one given order of justification." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 966).

<sup>18</sup>"In contrast to the dignity of a craftsman, who regards it as 'beneath his dignity' to perform or be required to perform substandard work, 'human dignity' refers to a status that applies to human beings as human beings, regardless of their specific identity". (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) pp. 966–967).

<sup>19</sup>"The violation of dignity consists in being ignored, not counting, being 'invisible' for the purposes of legitimizing social relations. In issues concerning human dignity, therefore, one should not think in terms of the end, of (objective or subjective) conditions or states of affairs, but of social relations, of processes, interactions and structures between persons, and of the status of individuals within them. (...) Being recognized in one's dignity as a human being means, in general terms, not being ignored in questions that concern one in essential ways." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 967).

<sup>20</sup>"As already suggested, the general concept of human dignity is, by contrast, inextricably bound up with that of self-determination in a creative and simultaneously moral sense that already involves a political component. At stake is one's status of not being subject to external forces that have not been legitimized to exercise rule – in other words, it is a matter of being respected in one's autonomy as an independent being. Kant captured this idea in terms of the 'worthiness of every rational subject to be a law-giving member in the kingdom of ends'." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 968).

<sup>21</sup>"To be such a law-giving member means not being disregarded when it comes to legitimizing moral action or social rule, and knowing that one should not disregard others in this respect either, that one is subject to the law oneself." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 968).

<sup>22</sup>"This conception of dignity, and correspondingly of respect for others as 'ends in themselves', means that humans must be regarded as beings who have an unconditional right to justification, a

Reflecting on this proposal of a critique of relations of justification, 23 some points on its content and effects must be underlined, in order to establish further discussion on the meaning of human dignity, generally, and in law, especially.

The first point involves considering the basic right to justification proposed by Forst as consisting of the need to ascribe to every person a veto-right, the right to reject any action or affirmation that could not be general and reciprocal, meaning that generality and reciprocity would be the decisive criteria in social interactions, so that "the criteria of validity of reciprocity and generality become transformed into criteria of discursive justification". 24 In such a discursive approach, the basic right to justification would constitute the starting point to, on a second level, any political constructivism of rights in concrete legal communities.25 And it should be understood from the point of view of social relations as power relations—according to Forst's critique of power, primarily as a discursive phenomenon, regarding an essential concept of noumenal power. 26 In fact, this view allows for the objection that it is not always assured that every person may act his right to justification, even if we consider that every person is the titular of such a right, which means that we must consider that it is not always possible in reality to construct a relationship in which each subject may reject any assertion which is not general and reciprocal.

basic right on which all other basic rights are founded. To possess human dignity means being an equal member in the realm of subjects and authorities of justification – an attribute, I should add, that does not depend on the active exercise of the capacity of justification, which would exclude infants or disabled persons. Correspondingly, to act with dignity means being able to justify oneself to others; to be treated in accordance with this dignity means being respected as such an equal member; to renounce one's dignity means no longer regarding oneself as such a member but as inferior; and to treat others in ways that violate their dignity means regarding them as lacking any justification authority." (Forst [2011](#page-130-0), pp. 968–969).

<sup>23</sup>See Forst [(2011](#page-130-0)), p. 972.

<sup>24</sup>"When it comes to justifying morally relevant actions in a social context, the decisive criteria are reciprocity and generality, since such actions must be justified by appeal to norms that can claim to hold in a reciprocal and general fashion. If one proceeds recursively from the claim to validity of such norms and asks what conditions must be fulfilled in order to redeem it, the criteria of validity of reciprocity and generality become transformed into criteria of discursive justification." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 969).

<sup>25</sup>"The underlying basic right to justification leads not only to substantive basic rights, but first of all to guarantees of participation in the processes in which such basic rights are formulated and justified. In this sense, the right to justification excludes paternalistic stipulations and denials of rights. Thus, on a second level, in addition to the moral constructivism that is abstract in nature, a more contextualized, discursive 'political constructivism' must be conceived which determines the basic rights and claims that should hold in a concrete legal community, always under the proviso that all those who are at risk of suffering disadvantage or discrimination have a reciprocal right of veto.". (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 969).

<sup>26</sup>"Against this background, power must be regarded primarily as a discursive phenomenon, indeed, however apparently paradoxically, as a noumenal phenomenon." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 970).

The second point, and the subsequent objection, refers to the consequent universalizability Forst ascribes to that discursive construction of human dignity in reference to a right to justification. In fact, such a discursive approach based on the right to justification, in Forst's proposal, would, by its nature and structure, avoid the objection that the comprehension of human dignity in question and its ground on moral autonomy would be purely "western", non-universalizable.27 This second objection, as a result of the first point considered, is mainly that such a "critique of relations of justification" 28 model would require the establishment of an intersubjective model stating a "basic structure of justification" as a fundamental claim of political and social justice.29 Such a condition, which is certainly desirable, is still nowadays hardly accomplishable in several contexts.

The third and final point asserts that the approach may be much different if we think the foundations of intersubjective relations as being settled on foundation and not on justification. In fact, justification could, at the limit, allow for an acceptance ex post of any assertion; in contrast, in the approach assumed in this reflection, foundation means affirming ex ante any assertion. Therefore, in this approach, the statement of the value judgment underlying relationships, mostly in law, rests on the juridical foundation of each assertion presented within it. Which means that any assertions in juridical normativity are built on an axiological set of values, internally built by or filtered by law, as their presuppositions, not on external assumptions externally imposed to law. This is, in the current approach, the differentiating feature of the autonomously constructed normativity of law, conferring on such assertions their juridicity (Neves [1999](#page-131-0)).

Understanding these different meanings, and their relevance within law, requires us, then, to deepen the effective densification of human dignity as a constitutively juridical value, and of juridicity as a selectively substantiating, regulating and critical instance of praxis, in a materially autonomous sense (Neves [2002](#page-131-0), pp. 864–866; Neves [1996](#page-131-0), p. 32 ff.; Neves [2008b](#page-131-0), pp. 127–128; Neves [2009](#page-131-0); Loureiro [2008](#page-131-0), pp. 675–704).

<sup>27</sup>"The idea of the dignity of the human being as a being equipped with the right to justification makes it possible to address and defuse the objection that the central conception of moral autonomy involved is a purely 'western', non-universalizable one – a specific aspect of the general problem of cultural immanence versus critical transcendence." (Forst [2011,](#page-130-0) p. 971).

<sup>28</sup>"Thus the 'critique of relations of justification' has a number of different meanings. First, it has the meaning of the critical analysis of non-justifiable political and social relations, including those in the economic and cultural dimensions – relations of discrimination, of exclusion, of deficient emancipation or equality of opportunity." (Forst [2011](#page-130-0), p. 972).

### 3 Human Dignity and Juridical Dignity, from Human to Post-human...

Conceived from the idea of human dignity, juridical dignity—as a condition and a substrate to conferring rights and duties—currently faces decisive challenges as to its intentionality and to its content: once the human being ceases to be the only constitutive subject of law, it is the intelligibility matrix of law itself that is changed, producing a shift as to the characterization of the centre of imputation of juridical subjectivity and intersubjectivity. The traditionally established reciprocal recognition of a specific condition of personhood will therefore be outdated.

If and as long as being human assumes a member of the human species as the imputation centre for determining juridical relevance and consequent responsibility, even if within a chain of levels of control increasingly established through artificial intelligence, this intersubjectivity will be assumed and thought through the analogy with historical-cultural experiences, by reference to different perceptions of being a person, and the notion of dignity that corresponds circumstantially to it... The question will, however, be completely different if this type of intersubjectivity is not the only one: that is, if one or more subjects intervening in the legally relevant relationship may not be persons. If the term post-humanism designates, among multiple specifications, generically, overcoming humanism—the humanism of the Roman humanitas, but also, and in sequence, the humanism of the Renaissance, as Heidegger summons them, from the outset in Brief über den Humanismus ([1947)](#page-130-0)—, even of the human, nowadays, beyond the limits of human intelligence, whether through postmodernism or transhumanism, it is proposed here to reflect on humanity as the conjugation of the given and the acquired as elements of the constitution of the human, in the sense in which, for example, Jesús Ballesteros (Ballesteros and Ruiz-Gálvez [2007)](#page-130-0) has presented—as based on Nietzsche's Übermensch, but, paradoxically, by abdicating the reference to amor fati.

As long as the notion of being a subject of law presupposes being a person, and, with that, a human being—or a collective composed of human beings—, that will be the fundamentally guiding characteristic to confer the quality of holder of subjective rights and legal duties—and, consequently, the dogmatically constructed requirements, for the meanings of legal personality, capacity for the enjoyment, and, in a certain way, and under certain conditions, the exercise of subjective rights and, concomitantly, of legal duties—, and will correspondingly imply the identification of a rational imputation centre, integrated in an element of the human species: the fundamental question—the paradigm—remains, therefore, in being a person, also because it implies personhood, firstly, and personality, next. Human dignity, so specifically taken under the requirements of the meaning of the reciprocal recognition, as Castanheira Neves proposes, requires assuming that only the reciprocal recognition of a civilizationally contextualized sense of human dignity—considering human subjects—, understood as an axiological-culturally raised element, constitutive of legal subjectivity and intersubjectivity, constitutes the support of a materially autonomous sense of law (Neves [2008a](#page-131-0), pp. 10–14; Neves [2008b](#page-131-0); Linhares [2008,](#page-131-0) pp. 426–427). If, and/or when, the subject of law is no longer a person—or a collective of persons—, there will be not only an alternative sense of legality, there will also be a different sense of intersubjectivity—not just juridically, in particular, but socially, in general... In such intersubjectivity, personality would possibly not prevail any more, and it could be presented in a gradation of centres of rational imputation, at least as human and non-human.

### 4 Human Dignity and Law, Among Merit, Value, and Justification: From an Ahistorical-Natural Given Value to a Historical-Axiological Construction

Reflecting and taking the different approaches considered above, proposing a discussion on the meaning(s) of human dignity in law will be stated through the possibility of ascribing a normatively constitutive character to the reciprocal recognition of human dignity as the background of legal (inter)subjectivity. In fact, as Nicholas Aroney too recently wrote, human dignity presupposes not strict individuality, but also community (Aroney [2021)](#page-130-0). Therefore, the signification of a person as a legal subject (not only in its legal personality, but also in its legal personhood, whilst considering other possible legal subjects) will require questioning; and, above and beyond, it will involve the assertion of an axiologically constitutive autonomous normative foundational conception of law as the constitutive background of that specific human dignity—thus reflecting on the legal meaning(s) of the autonomy of subjects (and the inevitably corresponding dialectic between liberty and responsibility) within the autonomy of law.

Proposing human dignity as a value, and, specifically, as the essential value in the foundation of law, would present no innovation at all, it can be said. But the question is not the enunciation of such a value as a premise; the question is: what does it mean to say that human dignity is the essential value foundation of law?

So, still, considering human dignity as a value in the foundation of law requires distinguishing ahistorical-natural given values to historical-axiological constructions, on the one hand, and, consequently, on the other hand, moral and juridical differentiating value, generally, in social practice, and, specifically, in legal practice.

As Michel Tournier points out, in his book The Mirror of Ideas (Le miroir des idées, 1994), in our cultural identity, like in a game of cards, some features constitute the given, and some other the constructed. In the former Tournier includes "(...) our hereditary genes, our physical makeup, our dispositions" (Tournier [1998](#page-131-0), p. 109). It is, though, not the whole story, as Tournier follows: "But it is also the milieu into which we were born, where we grew up – which we have not chosen any more than the colour of our eyes". And, in the latter: "It is then necessary to 'construct' our life. First, our culture (...). Second, our apprenticeship (...). Finally, our livelihood (...)" (Tournier [1998](#page-131-0), p. 109). Considering human dignity in law as a constructed feature—as a value—, not a given, or intrinsic, one, requires positing its content not only as merit nor merely as any intrinsic value, on the one hand, and the acknowledgment that human dignity cannot be reductively understood as an externally constructed or given value to be ascribed to law, on the other. Such a rejection means that human dignity in law and to law represents a specific merit ascription and value recognition. Of course, it may be—and surely, at least historically, as it has been said, it is...—inspired, or effectively grounded, on the cultural references of ethics, morality, and religion, at least. But what is crucially stated here is that, within law, and so within its specifically autonomous intention, content and requirements, human dignity is rather an essentially normative internal material foundational feature and value conferred by law to legal subjects. This means that law, if considered in the autonomous meaning presented, not only reflects on its content and prescriptions the practical-axiological judgments of each community, but it also specifically interprets, transforms-translates and construes its own reflection on those practical-axiological judgments—which means recognizing a dialectical relationship between law and reality, in which both the contents and the valuations are dialogically constructed and reciprocally influenced. It means, in its turn, that law is not only a mirrored reflection of history, but nor is history only a mirrored reflection of law (Gaudêncio [2008](#page-130-0)). Which is also to say, in our present context, that human dignity is not only a mirror of law, but nor is law only a mirror of human dignity. Therefore, the meaning of human dignity which law considers is the human dignity it constructs, by considering, in its foundations, the human being as the core of every practical valuation—and this means also that human dignity, human legal dignity and legal dignity may also differ. And all this requires, in fact, the recognition of different problems within the structure and content of juridical dignity, from that of distinguishing who or what is worthy of legal protection—after all, the very original problem from which law arose—to that of recognizing who or what can assume the position of legal subject—after all, the very original subject for which law arose.

The structural understanding of the foundations of law are, then, assumed as the civilizationally outlined possibility of identifying some values-projects as essential vectors for juridically relevant intersubjectivity—that in which something inter-est, that justifies the relativization of the intervening subjects, whilst recognizing them as subjects with a specific dignity statute, other than that which refers to absolute relations; a juridical dignity statute, in a specific definition of the relative position of the subjects, as a concretization of normative principles in practical criteria. And so, as mentioned above, assuming the normative principles as normatively juridical principles, as concretizations of that presupposition of dignity, as conditions for the possibility of a project of construction of juridical intersubjectivity, and, after all, as self-transcendental axiologically juridical foundations intersubjectively assumed from and intending to practical validity, in continuous construction and historical re-densification.

All that has been said is based on an axiological densification of a continuously constituting conception of juridicity, which, far from implying a return to a natural law theory (jus naturalism), establishes its basis on intersubjectively aggregating and historically constituting axiological valuations, thus refuting a strictly socialpolitical overlapping consensus30 or a strictly formal-procedural discursive determination.31 It rather regards those values as self-regulatory and self-transcendental axiological references—as conditions of possibility, but in the self-availability of the members of the concrete historical community in question; and, therefore, neither of pure empirical contingency—since they assume themselves to be binding ideals—, nor of heteronomous origin—since they result of historically human constitution and reconstitution (Gaudêncio [2012](#page-130-0)). And it intrinsically implies assuming that human dignity is a signifier with as many (signified) meanings and contents as the civilizational experiences considered—since the generic category of human dignity will only make sense if substantially densified, in context (Marques [2009](#page-131-0))—, for only the reciprocal recognition of that dignity—understood as an organic element of juridical subjectivity and intersubjectivity, and of their respective effectiveness—may constitute, to concord with Castanheira Neves, the support of a materially autonomous meaning of law (Neves [2002,](#page-131-0) pp. 869–870). Such a recognition of a such a dignity as a constitutive element of law, whilst not forgetting the contributions of other normatively relevant and juridically practical dimensions, confer on law the role of an indispensable intersubjective instance, normatively regulative and reflexively critical of the social praxis.

After all, both law and dignity should be critical and genealogically continuously reviewed in the underlining of the normatively constitutive possible projections of asserting human dignity. Human dignity is to be considered not only as an externally constructed or given value to be ascribed to law, rather it should also be proposed as an essentially normatively-internal material foundational construction, as a feature and as a value to be recognised in law, generally, and conferred by law, specifically—standing on the essential assumption of reciprocal recognition, beyond a dialogical-procedural justification, and, so, ascribed as a dialogicalaxiological valuation. The meaning of juridicity underlying this statement, within a jurisprudentialist perspective, as constructed by Castanheira Neves, affirms a materially autonomous determination of juridical intersubjectivity as a specific type of intersubjectivity—that in which the subjects refer to an object through a tertiality, exactly proposed by what is meant as law, the tertium comparationins, emerging as a collection of specific cultural values in force in each spatial-temporal framework, built on a concrete community self-availability (Neves [2008b](#page-131-0), [2009](#page-131-0)). There, these values represent, on the one hand, a historical construction—the manifestation of the irreducible dimension of constitutive historicity that the law presupposes—, on a first level, of historically constituting axiological valuations; that, on a second level, manifest themselves juridically in fundamental normative principles; and, in a third level, assume the crucial axiological acquisition of the notion of person as the subject of law, requiring the reciprocal recognition of the
