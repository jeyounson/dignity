Abstract The paper attempts to reconstruct the claim for the autonomy of modern western law in the oeuvre of Hart, Raz and Kelsen. It suggests that law's autonomy for Raz and Hart is realisable in relative terms, as they would accept that law's ultimate determination depends on social facts; moreover, they argued for no sharp separation between law and morality. This scenario renders the law's autonomy claim superfluous. Conversely, Kelsen articulated a cogent argument for law's autonomy by closing the system to the chance of incorporating exogenous elements in legal determination. He based his argument on a non-factual and non-reductive postulate besides strictly separating law from morality. Law's determination is selfstanding; therefore, it is genuinely autonomous. There is no relativisation of the claim. However, this autonomous law becomes problematic because it may irritate rational personal autonomy. Conclusion shows that the law's claim to autonomy is an intricate puzzle that requires rethinking its possibilities. The challenge is not trivial for legal theory; a sound reflection on the claim would conciliate a genuine autonomous law with rational autonomy.

### 1 Introduction

The idea of an autonomous law is a central claim of modern legal theory. It is also an intriguing puzzle. As some scholars suggested, it is a paradoxical claim, as is the idea of moral autonomy (Meld Shell [2013,](#page-90-0) 108–122; Khurana [2013,](#page-90-0) 50–74). Insistence

on presenting the law as autonomous seems to be at odds against its grounds. However, conceiving law as non-autonomous might render it redundant. If adequately articulated, it matters for making an emancipatory law possible. Legal scholars stand fractured between those who reject legal autonomy and others that affirm it. Analytically, questions about autonomy arose from an interest in unravelling the law's true uniqueness as a self-sufficient normative order. The law claims its reflexivity. Interest in this problem stems from both continental and Anglo-American legal theories. Hans Kelsen developed the idea early on to a sophisticated degree in the Germanophone discussion. In Anglo-American jurisprudence, the legal autonomy discourse has been less explicit but not absent. I cannot address all the arguments put forward in these few pages. Therefore, I will examine how three contemporary legal philosophers associated with legal positivist tradition have approached the claim. Legal positivism has insisted on the law's autonomy by claiming to determine its distinguishability from its most similar competitor: morality.

In what follows, I shall attempt to reconstruct the argument for law's autonomy in H.L.A. Hart, Joseph Raz and Hans Kelsen. Emphasis is because they are presented as "[t]he most important architects of contemporary legal positivism." (L. Green and Adams [2019)](#page-89-0). As for the first two, I will take some of their most substantial theses from which it is possible to cast how they approached the claim. One is the argument that law is separable from morals, whilst the other contention refers to law's ultimate reliability upon sources founded in social facts. Analysis suggests that Hart and Raz are engaged with the autonomy argument ambivalently. For them, the autonomy of law is somehow "relative". I will then contrast that conclusion with Kelsen's view on legal autonomy, which does not yield relativisation. It is a more convincing account because the law is self-referential (Eigengesetzlichkeit). Kelsen does not let the law depend upon the facts nor accept a mere separability but instead suggests sharp separation from morals. Nevertheless, Kelsen's self-contained model is not exempt from complications. I will only state a few of them. Conclusions indicate that the law's autonomy problem is far from being an uncontested issue. Further scrutiny is required.

This text will develop under the following plan. Firstly, I will provide a general mapping for the discussion (2). Here I will identify analogous arguments showing how the issue has been approached in modern legal theory. I will then explain some methodological decisions. Secondly, I will delimit the concept of legal autonomy follow in this paper (3–3.1). Subsequently, I will give a very brief historical review of the idea of autonomy and its relation to legal theory (3.2). Thirdly, I will present the separability thesis as it has been approached in contemporary Anglo-American analytical jurisprudence (4). Afterwards, I will show H.L.A. Hart's development of the separability of law and morality. Mainly, I will review Hart's thesis on conceptual separability and contingent connections. Some questions and problems will be raised (4.1-4.2.-4.3). Fourthly, I will expose Joseph Raz's treatment of the autonomy of law. I will begin with the thesis on the autonomy of legal reasoning (5). Then, I will explore Raz's idea on the sources of law based on social facts (5.1). Certain doubts and difficulties will be introduced and discussed (5.2). Fifthly, I will outline two of Hans Kelsen's postulates from which it is possible to reconstruct a sound argument favouring the non-relative autonomy of law (6). I will describe Kelsen's methodology firstly (6.1), immediately, Kelsen's peripheral imputation doctrine (6.2), and at once, Kelsen's separation thesis through the idea of legal validity (6.3.). A recap and a few potential drawbacks of the argument will be briefly raised (6.4–6.5). Finally, I will offer some concluding remarks and critical comments (6). Rather than providing answers and solutions, this paper aims to formulate questions and sow doubts about an old dilemma. It will focus on revisiting the law's autonomy claim in contemporary legal theory in an exploratory, descriptive and non-conclusive fashion.

### 2 Problem Overview and Methodological Clarifications

In 1996, a collective volume in Anglo-American Jurisprudence was published on law's autonomy, edited by Robert George. The book's title, however, is distracting. Instead of grappling comprehensively with the autonomy of law per se, the book addressed legal positivist debates about the question of to what extent (if at all) law has connections to morality. Only one contribution explicitly dealt with the autonomy topic (Postema [1996,](#page-91-0) 79–118). In the preface, the editor outlined the autonomy of law debate contours in this tradition of legal philosophy. "[The natural law theorists] [...] much less deny the (relative) autonomy of law, as a social phenomenon and as an intellectual discipline, from morality and moral philosophy." (George 1996, viii [brackets added]). It is noteworthy to highlight its allusion to the law's "relative" autonomy. It is an intriguing assertion. The question is, how can something be autonomous but, at the same time, non-autonomous? What does this "relativisation" of the law's autonomy mean in this context? If a phenomenon is relative, it is not absolute, i.e., dependent on something, and does not exclude other relations.

Robert George was not alone in suggesting something like that. For example, Andrei Marmor wrote that "[l]aw is partly autonomous because it is conventional, and not the other way around" (Marmor [2001a](#page-90-0), 208 [emphasis added]).1 In public law and cultural studies of law, Robert Post wrote about the "relatively autonomous discourse of law" (Post [1991,](#page-91-0) vii–viii [emphasis added]). Similarly, during the 1970s and 1980s, there was a lively dialogue on the autonomy of law in the context of the sociology of law and Marxist legal theory. This debate seems to be a theoretical landmark that was then taken up, without satisfactory explanations, by jurisprudential discussions (Tomlins, [2007](#page-91-0), 551). These authors centred on a dominant interpretation of Marx's thinking on the place of law concerning society's economic base.

<sup>1</sup> Following Hart's ideas, Marmor also qualifies the autonomy of law. For him, the law is a social practice constituted by "social conventions". A detailed exposition of his arguments is available at Marmor [(2001b](#page-90-0)) 144 ff.

According to some of these authors' writings,2 the law would be nothing but a reflection of economic relations. In historical development, the law would not have played a causal role by itself (Engels and Marx, [1978](#page-89-0), 26-27). Marx believed that the autonomy of bourgeois law was compromised by ideological interests that sought to distract from the truth about the modern law's character. Thus, the law lacks genuine autonomy and operates under instrumental purposes, even though it has a differentiated metaphysical status. According to this viewpoint, the law is not autonomous. Later authors like Engels and Althusser tempered the assertion and suggested that law possesses somewhat "relative" autonomy (cf. Engels [1967](#page-89-0), 462–465; Althusser [1995](#page-89-0), 276; in the American socio-legal discussion, see Balbus [1977](#page-89-0), 571).

The autonomy argument also evokes the dispute on the nature of adjudication and legal reasoning between "formalist" and "realist" positions of the late 19th and early twentieth centuries in the USA. The former supported radical autonomy, whilst the second declared the law instrumental and not wholly autonomous. Legal reasoning poses an inner logic that provides rational solutions in the juridical field for legal formalism. It does not need to manage external resources, for there is no necessity to call upon political, moral, religious, or other extra-legal reasoning. Instead, based on its own sources, the law establishes decision-making procedures to arrange conflicts and be reflexive about itself. However, the core of these legal formalist theses received harsh criticism from the legal realist movement. These authors argued that legal reasoning, as judicial reasoning, cannot be autonomous since it is unavoidable that judges rely on policies or empirical sciences when deciding. To the extent that the law is radically indeterminate, adjudicators must necessarily complete it, even resorting to extra-legal reasoning (cf. Bix [2003,](#page-89-0) 978–979). Thus, the law becomes primarily judicial decisionism. There is no case for the law's autonomy under these terms.

Although there is no debate under those premises in contemporary analytical jurisprudence, finding proximities and certain discursive continuity is possible. Somehow, the law is also "relatively" autonomous for foremost writers in the analytical legal positivist tradition, albeit for distinct reasons and contexts. The question is that law is closely connected to other normative orders and ultimately depends on non-legal factors to exist and determine its content. Thus, it does not appear that the autonomy of law is complete but rather partial—as it was conceived by the Marxist legal tradition and American legal realism. However, this assertion seems contradictory to the aims of legal positivism, which stresses the separation and differentiation of law as an autonomous order. Indeed, Robert George correctly identified the emphasis in the autonomy argument with the legal positivist programme.

Notwithstanding, generalising with the label legal positivism seems troublesome at this point. Even inaccurate. There are disagreements between authors who are

<sup>2</sup> The instrumentalist approach is mainly based on interpreting a passage from the Preface of Marx's Zur Kritik der Politischen Ökonomie (1859). Marx and Engels offered a similar argument earlier in Die Deutsche Ideologie (1845-1846).

usually classified in this doctrine and amongst self-ascribed positivists. Moreover, different legal positivist schools unfolded with their own identities due to geographical particularities and contexts. Therefore, although this paper will refer to certain widely accepted general tenets of legal positivism, the focus will be on leading scholars. Nevertheless, there is one precaution to be considered. This exercise could run the risk of being infructuous. The comparison may be unsuitable because certain epistemic preconceptions and situational influences are bound to each author's thoughts. With this in mind, this paper considers that the law's autonomy claim is a conundrum that goes beyond a sole intellectual tradition. In this sense, what will become manifest is that scholars who are usually labelled as legal positivists have dealt more explicitly with law's autonomy in jurisprudence. Hence, the emphasis will be on the writers and not on multiple perspectives or families of theories that do not provide a precise picture of an author's argumentation.

### 3 Autonomy Conceptions

I shall use 'autonomy' in its etymological sense as auto-nomos, or in other words, "having its laws". The term meaning may imply an understanding of autonomy as self-legislation, self-determination, or self-government. Independence from the dominion of other's laws was the idea ancient Greeks thought of when describing the city-state's status (G. Dworkin [1988,](#page-89-0) 12–13). They described a political entity as an autonomia when it self-produced its own rules and definitions to self-determinate its boundaries and trajectories as communities. Under this understanding, an autonomous body has no external dependencies, nor does it have the quality of heteronomous, nor does it need external inputs to operate in the world. Thus, autonomy's etymological roots were related to a political body's characteristics. However, at that time, there were no sharp distinctions between ethics and politics, private and public life, or between individuals and the community.

From modernity onwards, autonomy's concept was expanded to the individual agent. The aim was to provide reasons against the subjects' determination by a given natural hierarchical order resulting from medieval age circumstances. Springing from the Enlightenment—primarily since the developments of Rousseau (though still in a political fashion) and then refined by Kant—the concept of autonomy was rethought and assimilated to personal will (Kant [1996a,](#page-90-0) 37–108; Kant [1996b,](#page-90-0) 133–272). It consolidated a substantive moral meaning as a reaction to the rising tension between authority and freedom. This intellectual development has been historically configured in that shape because autonomy was mainly related to reflections about the status of personal liberty. The Kantian view of moral autonomy as selfdetermination or self-government was widespread in modern practical philosophy development (Schneewind [1998](#page-91-0), 5). It takes the notion of a subject as freely making up her consciousness under their own universal moral code. Kant's significant contribution was the (re)invention of the concept of autonomy, detaching it from the political sphere and transferring it to the realm of morality (Ibid., 1). The above denotes the most elementary philosophical meaning of autonomy: a self-legislated agent. It does not necessarily imply the idea of independence. I will return to this understanding of individual rational autonomy in Sect. 6.5.

## 3.1 Autonomy in the Law and Autonomy of the Law

Contemporary legal theories employ autonomy under two senses in continuous tension: subjective and objective. The former is associated with personal selfdetermination and takes, to some extent, the connotation that Kant ascribed to it. The latter refers to the law's ontological status. Regarding the subjective meaning, it involves the individual will primarily manifest through giving consent for executing actions. Here the law intervenes in regulating human agency and personal actions. The law does this at least through two modalities. Firstly, it realises and protects private autonomy through subjective rights. E.g., constitutional rights. Secondly, the law expedites people's interaction concerning ordinary affairs, business, and the transmission of property. E.g., the freedom principle in private law. Autonomy in the law is the denomination for the subjective sense. I will not pursue it further here since it is not the research aim.3

The second sense of autonomy in legal theory is its objective denotation: autonomous law. Positively, it entails juridical autonomy as a self-referential normative order; self-determination of law's normativity, i.e., self-sufficiency as how law creates and replicates itself. Negatively, it presupposes law's decoupling from other normative orders. It entails an intriguing claim: the law does not depend on social, moral or political phenomena: law's non-dependence. The invocation of autonomy makes it possible to identify the law's differentia specifica (Jestaedt, [2008,](#page-90-0) xxv) as a normative reflexive order. It does not need any recursion to external spheres to be what it is. It is a matter of applying the autonomy concept to emulate individual self-determination to the realm of the law's existence. It is a about the law's status, conceiving it as a unique system existing in its own right. This step could mean assuming the possibility of individuating and apprehending the juridical phenomenon in the world. In so far as the law is ontologically autonomous, it is describable according to the particularities of the law itself. The authors analysed in this paper appealed to the objective sense directly and indirectly. This work will focus on this conception of the autonomy of law.

<sup>3</sup> Mortimer Sellers edited a collective volume called Autonomy in the law (2007). It addresses how the law regulates private autonomy in various comparative legal systems. It includes multiple practical topics, like assisted dying, wrongful life and the death penalty, from different law disciplines. See esp. the introduction (Sellers [2007,](#page-91-0) 1–11).

## 3.2 Autonomy of Law. A Brief Historical Review

The statement about law's autonomy requires some historical context. Before "postmetaphysical" thinking, there was no insistence on sharply detaching the law from morals or normative orders grounded in religion or mystic authority. The questions about autonomy were not relevant. There was a sense of the unity of normativity that did not admit major departmentalisations. The argument for the individuation of the phenomena (including normativity) came with modernity's emergence, the rise of the bourgeois state, the Enlightenment, and the division of labour by specialisation. It involves, amongst others, the social life areas gradual separating from each other, their disentanglement from some seemingly global and mythical overall dynamic, and their reconstruction as a specific field with distinct rules and dynamics (Jameson [2002,](#page-90-0) 90). It is crucial to isolate the specifically juridical space if it is plausible to apply this discourse to the legal phenomenon. To distinguish between the matters that properly pertain to law. Legal scholarship argues that legal materials are not related to a religious or sacred origin. Law is not the result of God's commands, the Church, or an absolute monarch. Politically, it was a reaction against ancient times. The social events unfolding involved searching for the independence of all spheres of human activity—e.g., economics from politics, the law from morality and religion.

In this historical development, the rise of early legal positivism played a role. In the British tradition, authors like Bentham or Austin intended to answer whether it is possible to identify the law without reference to another competing normativity or evaluative and desirable standards (Christodoulidis et al. [2018,](#page-89-0) 133–136). The central idea was to associate the distinctiveness of the legal phenomenon as valid law with roots in social facts materialised through the will of men and modern secular democratic institutions. It transitioned from a holistic worldview to the individual's standpoint, seeking a far-reaching differentiation that led to a multiplicity of social fragments. It was the starting point of the modern positivist separability thesis and its principal argument: the law is neither identical nor can it be confused with other normative phenomena. The law, then, has its own identity and consequent implications.

The quest for the law's specificity led to a division into provinces.4 The law was one of them. The immediate question that arises is separation from what? The answer is to be found in one of legal positivism's central theses to explain the nature of modern law: the detachment from morality. This separation was a fundamental achievement because they had no radical differentiation historically. Both have shared similar terminology and have used deontic elements such as permission, obligation, or prohibition. In this context, just as the American colonies declared their political independence from the European monarchies, law claimed emancipation from the realm of morality.

<sup>4</sup> This is, of course, the sense exposed by John Austin's The Province of Law Determined (1832).

### 4 Autonomy of Law as Separability

There is no unique legal positivist theory (Spaak and Mindus [2021,](#page-91-0) 3–5; Waluchow [1998,](#page-91-0) 389–390; Raz [2009a,](#page-91-0) 37). It has multiple versions, and they vary in their contours. Not all positivist accounts are necessarily compatible between them. In the Anglo-American jurisprudence tradition, most legal positivists aim to provide a descriptive conceptual response to the distinctive common characteristics of law. To do that, some authors appeal to identify those shared properties focusing upon social facts alone.5 Likewise, they reject the notion that there are evaluative components in determining what the law is. The discussion about the best interpretation of these positivists' assertions is profoundly specialised and sophisticated. Attempting to make a general description or catalogue might not do justice to its intellectual development. Despite this, it is plausible to mention some distinctions among their commitments. The literature has identified at least six main legal positivist theses (Bertea [2007](#page-89-0), 68; Green [2008](#page-89-0), 1035 ff.): sources (i); practical difference (ii); conventionality (iii); incorporation (iv); social facts (v), and the separability thesis (vi). Yet, it is reasonable to assert that analytical legal positivism can rest on two central tenets (Bertea [2007](#page-89-0), 67–69; Coleman and Leiter [2010](#page-89-0), 228): separability and social facts. In this regard, the separability thesis is one that almost all legal positivists share. The most prominent positivist author in analytical jurisprudence, H.L.A. Hart, characterised law under this label. This issue shall receive a further examination supra.

Various prominent contemporary Anglophone legal positivist authors have had something to say on this point. Whilst not claiming to be exhaustive, I shall present a sample here. "If there is one doctrine distinctively associated with legal positivism, it is the separability of law and morality" (Krammer [2004](#page-90-0), 1 ff.). "The Separability Thesis, foundation of positivism, asserts that law and morality are conceptually distinct". It denies "there is necessary overlap" between the law and morality (Himma [2002](#page-90-0), 125). However, whether this is the pivotal trait of legal positivism is heavily controversial. Hart ([1958](#page-90-0)) himself was cautious about the point. He identified more than one separability doctrine (see supra next section). In contrast, an author like John Gardner jettisoned the separability thesis as false. He indicated that correct legal positivism affirms legal rules' validity by invoking a sources-based thesis. This scholar propounded the following proposition: "In any legal system, whether a given norm is legally valid, and hence whether it forms part of the law of that system, depends on its sources, not its merits." (Gardner [2012](#page-89-0), 19–20).

Other authors have replaced the sources thesis with the social one (Coleman and Leiter [2010](#page-89-0), 228; Simmonds [2002](#page-91-0), 127–131). Nevertheless, these legal scholars have maintained the separability thesis as an undistinguishable positivist tenet. "All positivists share two central beliefs: first, that what counts as law in any particular society is fundamentally a matter of social fact or convention; second, that there is no

<sup>5</sup> See, e.g., assertions and descriptions made by Green and Adams [(2019](#page-89-0)), esp. "Development and Influences."

necessary connection between law and morality" (Coleman and Leiter [2010](#page-89-0), id.). Notwithstanding, Coleman has rejected the statement in other of his works. "Things change, for I now think that the separability thesis is no part of positivism at all and that it is in any case very likely false [...] If the separability thesis is not the core of legal positivism, then what is? In my view, the core of legal positivism is the social facts thesis" (Coleman [2009](#page-89-0), 365–366; 383–384). In the same order of ideas, an author like Joseph Raz thought that the separability thesis was not sound and propounded the "social thesis" as the fundamental principle amongst another positivist theses (Raz [1994](#page-91-0), 230 ff.). Later, he finally dismissed the separability thesis though accepting the separation thesis (Raz [2009a](#page-91-0), 37–45; Raz [2009a](#page-91-0), 314–315). Given that the separation thesis and the sources-based social thesis implicitly underline the autonomy of law in both its negative and positive sense, in what follows, I will first examine the separability thesis under Hart's understanding. Afterwards, I shall consider Joseph Raz's sources-based social thesis.

## 4.1 H.L.A. Hart and the Separability Thesis

Hart never explicitly asserted anything about the autonomy of law. Neither affirmation nor negation follows from silence. Therefore, I will attempt a reconstruction of the claim following his writings on jurisprudence.6 Namely, taking into account his emphasis on the separability thesis. This tenet has been a significant legal positivist claim, so it was for Hart. It connotes law's autonomy since it appeals to distinguishing legal from morals. It aims to present law as social practices that are neither dependent on, nor related to, morality. In anglophone legal philosophy, the thesis consolidates with H.L.A. Hart's Positivism and the Separation of Law and Morals ([1958,](#page-90-0) 594–600). In this lecture, Hart discussed the British utilitarian legal positivist theses regarding critiques and misunderstandings formulated against them by some non-positivist authors like Lon Fuller and Gustav Radbruch. In the article, he identified in a footnote at least five theses that might represent the legal positivism account in the "contemporary jurisprudence." One of them was "the contention that there is no necessary connection between law and morals or law as it is and ought to be." (Hart [1958,](#page-90-0) 600, note 25). It is worth noting that the separability claim was not Hart's original personal thesis. Instead, he mainly described and discussed state-ofthe-art. Namely, reviewing and clarifying the positivist legal doctrine from Jeremy Bentham's tradition and John Austin's works.

<sup>6</sup> Peter Fitzpatrick's critique of The Concept of Law and legal positivism in general identified H.L.A. Hart as one of those authors who defended a substantial autonomy of law. "The current champion [of those who assert law's autonomy] remains H.L.A. Hart with his 'concept of law'" (Fitzpatrick [1992](#page-89-0), 3–6 [brackets added]). Fitzpatrick emphasised the strong connection of law with the social dimension. However, Fitzpatrick errs in believing that the law is entirely autonomous for Hart.

Hart focused his stance, arguing against the confusion about what the law is and what it ought to be. The formulation means the following: firstly, it leads Hart to reject the claim that it is possible to identify a necessary or natural connection, a coincidence between the concept of law and morality. The statement does not mean that legal rules validity criteria must fulfil moral considerations. E.g., officials might be prone to applying evaluative considerations in adjudication; likewise, the law content does not necessarily need to conform to or derive from morality. Both are separate phenomena. Secondly, the appraisal of a legal system's justice differs from describing the law. Valid law might be, nonetheless, morally wrongful. Howbeit, a law's description certainly does not preclude judging a legal order if it does not uphold basic moral standards. This stance means that a legal system might be immoral and despicable; however, it is still conceptually legal. These two arguments are synthesisable in the following proposition: the law's content and existence do not relate to morals.

Hart reconfirmed and fully articulated those statements time after in The Concept of Law and the Postscript. In those texts, he insisted that "although there are many different contingent connections between law and morality, there are no necessary conceptual connections between the content of law and morality; and hence morally iniquitous provisions may be valid as legal rules or principles." (Hart [2012](#page-90-0), pp. 181–182, 268). Hart admitted that his utterance is pertinent only in the conceptual domain whilst in the factual realm, the law and the morality have frequently coincided: "it is in no sense a necessary truth that laws reproduce or satisfy certain demands of morality, though, in fact, they have often done so." (Hart [2012](#page-90-0), pp. 185–186). A case of contingent convergence is the common normative language shared by morality and law, e.g., the idea of responsibility. Despite contingent connections, Hart argued that there are substantial conceptual divergences between moral and legal responsibility. Rather than semantic dissimilarities, the content of the legal and moral rules and principles highlights the differences. Notably, this is apparent in the responsibility criteria applied. Legal liability may rely on strict or even objective liability concepts. However, this is not, in principle, possible to harmonise with the moral responsibility concept (Hart [1967](#page-90-0), pp. 346–364, partly reprinted in Hart [2008](#page-90-0), pp. 222–227; Hart [2012](#page-90-0), pp 167–180. See also Freeman [2014](#page-89-0), p. 16). There is a sense of law's autonomy in Hart, at least in the conceptual sphere. Law is conceptually separable from morals. However, one question comes. Why is law separable and not an entirely separate domain?

In chapter IX of the Concept of Law, one might find an answer to the question.7 Here Hart admitted the natural law minimum content in every legal system. Law and morals necessarily share specific normative content. To explain it, the author alludes to some "truisms" regarding human nature and aims, besides the existence of some environmental material conditions. The "elementary truths" included limited human

<sup>7</sup> Another strong connection point might be between rules and justice in The Concept of Law, chapter VIII. I will not dwell on this point, as I am interested in describing the limited scope of the separability thesis.

altruism, scarcity of resources, human vulnerability, approximate equality, and narrow personal understanding (Hart [2012](#page-90-0), 176, 192–200; Hart [1983](#page-90-0), 111–116). The assumption about human nature is an anthropological thesis. Simultaneously, his presupposition about humankind's primary purposes as a commitment to survive is a teleological thesis. The argumentation clarifies that those features yield reasons to have legal rules in a particular society to the extent that it permits neutralising natural human tendencies to conflict and violence. Natural law minimum content's purpose is to achieve human endurance. Such fundamental moral rules facilitate human survival in social communities and lead to elemental ethical principles that might later acquire legal forms, e.g., banning murder, rape, or assault. Two queries arise at this point. Firstly, as Hart argues, one may ask whether those statements presuppose some essentialism regarding human nature. Secondly, the basic ethical prohibitions may correspond to the content of penal law norms in most criminal codes. The content of these fundamental legal rules may, at this level, remain indiscernible from universal moral principles. Thus, one might ask whether Hart suggests that moral principles might integrate the legal basis.

Regarding the former, someone could criticise those contentions about human nature. Arguably, Hart is not considering the possibility of how life's material and social conditions may instead determine one result or another. According to some social theories, social life is radically contingent, and the possibility of any given human nature is highly controversial. Some of these authors may argue that human nature is based on a materialist historical whole of social relations and not on the idea of an abstract isolated human being in an a-historical state of nature, as Hart supposed, following the account suggested by Hume and Hobbes8 (cf. Hume [1888,](#page-90-0) Book III, part 2, sect. 2; Hobbes [1996,](#page-90-0) chaps. 14, 15). As for the second query, Hart accepts that law content usually coincides with morality. The point to note is that the author insists on the contingency of such relations. Society's moral minimums would not necessarily attain universal application concerning the addressees. Nor would those rules be necessarily developed toward legal form; neither might they necessarily be the content thereof. This reading is further evidence of the conceptual scope to which Hart refers. Law is only separable at the conceptual level, which leaves margin for connections to non-legal elements in non-conceptual hypotheses. The separability thesis alone does not suggest that law is a wholly self-referential order. The autonomy of law seems relative on this point in so far as there is no entire separation of law and non-juridical elements.

## 4.2 Separable But Not Separate

Given the above, does Hart accept a strong separation between law and morality? It seems that the answer is negative. He only stated that the factual reality of law does

<sup>8</sup> Marx's approach to human nature [Gattungswesen] is explained by Geras [(2016)](#page-89-0) 61 ff.

not necessarily imply that its concept contains value elements. Only descriptions of the facticity are sufficient to elucidate the law's concept. It is important to remark that Hart's assertions about the links between law and morality rely mainly upon a conceptual basis. Law's autonomy as a separation from a normative order such as morality is only related to the conceptual aspect. Law and morality have different concepts, so accepting contingent connections in non-conceptual domains is reasonable. E.g., mutual reinforcement in some instances, appraisal of law's justice, rules foundation in morals and shared normative vocabulary. Indeed, these confluences do not make law an inescapably moral issue. Law's autonomy is only relative because separability registers in a limited realm. Thus, for Hart, the law is, to some extent, conceptually (and relatively) autonomous. The law might be non-autonomous beyond that scope because the analytical-conceptual approach is narrow. Law's historical, sociological, and cultural understanding is beyond conceptual reach. That is to say, in those programmes that conceive law as a human practice necessarily embedded in culture, history or economics, non-autonomous law may be conceivable. It was the case for critical authors from sociology or anthropology like Pierre Bourdieu ([1986](#page-89-0), 3–19) or Sally Falk-Moore [(1973](#page-89-0), 720–722). Whilst not neglecting the nuances related to the different intellectual and methodological traditions represented by non-philosophical scholars, Hart seems to have left room for alternative interpretations.

Hart's remaining doubts about separability unleashed an intense debate in analytical jurisprudence. The dispute over his legacy is exquisite and nuanced between different interpretations of the separability thesis, i.e., inclusive vs exclusive positivism. The disagreement revolves roughly around to what extent it is possible to conceptualise law by including some fundamental moral principles through the rule of recognition. According to Brian Bix, "exclusive legal positivism interprets or elaborates this assertion [the separability thesis] to mean that moral criteria can be neither sufficient nor necessary conditions for the legal status of a norm." In different terms, paraphrasing the author: exclusive legal positivism states that 'social sources fully determine the existence and content of every law' (Bix [2005,](#page-89-0) 36–37 [brackets added). In its turn, "inclusive legal positivism interprets the separation of law and morality differently, arguing that while there is no necessary moral content to a legal rule (or a legal system), a particular legal system may, by conventional rule, make moral criteria necessary or sufficient for validity in that system." (Bix, Idem).

Whilst the separability thesis seems persuasive, the dispute over its soundness is subtle. It revolves around the extent of the meaning of necessary and contingent connections. Accordingly, depending on the type of answer offered, it would be possible to determine the ultimate factors that influence the law's content and makes possible its determination. Hence, the task within the analytical positivist doctrine is to clarify the types of connections and attributes of interrelations between normative orders according to sundry methodological frameworks. For instance, Jules Coleman has insisted on some of the intricacies of the distinction amongst positivist authors to keep the thesis' coherence. "Since many [...] of the most interesting of these [statements] will be necessary relations, it is easy to see why the so-called 'separability thesis' has gained such prominence in jurisprudence. There are at least two problems with focusing as much attention [...] on the separability thesis. The first is that there is not really 'one' thesis. It can be interpreted narrowly or broadly, and there are a number of different narrow interpretations as well as a number of different broad ones, each of which can be assessed individually. The second problem is that the focus on the 'separability thesis' has proven distracting. Too little attention has been paid to other philosophically important ways in which law and morality might be related to one another [...]" (Coleman [2007,](#page-89-0) 582 [brackets added]).

## 4.3 Separability Relativises the Autonomy of Law

Hitherto, it was possible to see that the normative order from which law has tried to differentiate and detach itself is morality. The autonomy claim is a reaction against the conflation of law and morals and plays somewhat of an ethical role. Hart did not support an amoral theory of law. Neither did he have an ideological objection against natural law reactionary characters and its postulate about allegedly immutable normative orders. Instead, Hart sought to prevent positive law from being instrumentalised as an excuse to subvert higher moral values. If one accepted that both fields were indivisible, the ideal morality might be endangered as the freedom of men to criticise the deviant or iniquitous law that could oppress individuals. Thus, the feasibility of decoupling law from morality was a basis for a morally apt law and a free critical morality. Without embracing non-positivist theses, it is viable to formulate judgments about the justice of a given legal system without denying that it is inevitably legal.

Hart's argument allows non-necessary and non-conceptual relations between law and morality. E.g., contingently, the latter may inform the former before its institutional determination by a legislature. Furthermore, the law may incorporate morale and political components when adjudicators complete legal rules' "penumbra" areas. This stance positions him as an "inclusive positivist" (cf. Hart [2012,](#page-90-0) 250–251),9 at least as far as his separability thesis is concerned. In empirical matters, he even seems to be correct. Let us consider, e.g., subjective rights provisions in most modern positive constitutions. This circumstance means that morality and law, as normative orders, follow different and parallel paths at the conceptual level. Beyond this distinction, there is no substantial autonomy of law. The law's claim to individuation as an autonomous phenomenon seems diffuse. One can observe that the separability thesis, rather than delineating an autonomy of two normative orders as separation, leaves the law in a difficult position, for apart from the conceptual sphere is cumbersome to find the law's specificity. The argument seems incapable of separating them both in a strong sense. Accordingly, the postulate asserts that law and morality may contingently intersect at some points; whilst the overlap is not

<sup>9</sup> In the pages cited above, H.L.A. Hart recognises himself as a "soft positivist".

necessary for the concept of law, neither might it determine one another and vice versa. Is this assertion sound enough to trust the law's autonomy fate?

One might insinuate that there is a weak form of separation in this claim. This affirmation is because there is a tiny space left for upholding the autonomy of law through the separability thesis. Consequently, the reconstruction of the law's autonomy claim in Hart's thought acquires the character of a relative one. Similarly, the separability argument is silent about the consequences of relations with other phenomena such as politics or economics. Thus, at least in the way formulated by Hart and some of its commentators, separability cannot be a sound thesis for the autonomy of law. Nonetheless, within the Anglo-American juridical discussion, exclusive positivism suits better a substantial autonomy of law; it was certainly not one of Hart's arguments. By an act of self-closure and not admitting the possibility of integrating law with moral elements, exclusive positivism succeeds in positioning a more autonomous law. One of its central tenets is Joseph Raz's source-based conception of law. Although it does not allow for the permeability of moral ingredients, it leaves law subordinated to the factual. Law depends on social facts alone. In the next section, I will dwell on this thesis. Howbeit, first, I will examine Raz's ideas about the autonomy of legal reasoning.

### 5 Joseph Raz and the Autonomy Theses

Joseph Raz is an author who explicitly dealt with the law's autonomy puzzle more directly in anglophone legal philosophy. Raz stated that it is possible to identify and distinguish at least two autonomy theses in contemporary jurisprudence—the autonomy of legal reasoning and law's autonomy. This section focuses on the autonomy of legal reasoning (Sect. 5.1). To some extent, this argument updates legal formalism's longstanding claim. Under varied views, authors such as Gerald Postema, Robert Summers, Ernest Weinrib, and Stanley Fish have said something about it. Reasoning as thinking about the law in judicial decision-making is the debatable key. It is a distinct approach to legal autonomy, and it is not the essay subject. Nonetheless, I will succinctly reconstruct Raz's argument to clarify his position on legal autonomy. Raz thought it was necessary to elucidate the flaws in the autonomy of legal reasoning and reveal why it is untenable as a thesis on legal autonomy. The aim is to provide a better insight to examine his argument on law's autonomy (Sect. 5.2). This section (5.1) will be descriptive, and the reader is free to skip it and move on to the next one.

## 5.1 Raz's Rejection of the Autonomy of Legal Reasoning

Raz endorsed the idea of a unity of non-autonomous legal reasoning (Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 121). He rejected and criticised the legal reasoning autonomy thesis (Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 376–382). The author linked the legal reasoning discussion to the pre-emption thesis or the exclusionary reasons for action. This movement relates to Raz's service conception of authority: "the fact that an authority requires performance of action is a reason for its performance which is not to be added to all other relevant reasons when assessing what to do but should exclude and take the place of some of them" (Raz [2009a](#page-91-0), 46). The pre-emption thesis is also present in moral reasoning as part of the rules (understanding rules in a broad sense) (Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 381–382). Therefore, legal reasoning cannot be properly autonomous.

In order to understand his viewpoint, it matters to remark that he conceives legal reasoning in dual terms (Raz [1993,](#page-91-0) 2; Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 121).10 Firstly, as reasoning about what the law is —i.e., reasoning regarding the nature of law. "Legal reasoning is reasoning about the law, or reasoning concerning legal matters" (Raz [1993,](#page-91-0) 1). He called that outlook the legal reasoning "weak sense". In later works, Raz also called this aspect "legal reasoning or legal thought" (Raz [1994](#page-91-0), 238 [italics added]) and "reasoning according to law" or "reasoning to establish the content of the law as it is", as well (Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 379–378). This reasoning would be autonomous because it is necessary to conclude that the law has certain value-neutral content (Ibid., 376–379). Raz's entire argumentation leads to the sources-based conception of law, which means it is unnecessary to recourse to evaluative arguments to determine the law's contents.

Secondly, it is understood as reasoning about how legal disputes must be judicially decided based on the law. "[Legal reasoning] is any reasoning to conclusions which entail that, according to law, if a matter were before a court, the court should decide thus and so" (Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 376 [brackets added]). This approach is what he called legal reasoning "strong sense", and it is ordinary evaluative reasoning. This type of legal reasoning would not be autonomous because it focuses on the adjudication process. In this instance, the adjudicator's decision will contain judgemental considerations. Nevertheless, Raz remarks that legal reasoning is not exclusively judicial reasoning. In connection with that, he mentions as an example that this type of legal reasoning is primarily interpretative reasoning —it aims to establish the content of authoritative legal binding standards. Such a case is not autonomous; neither is it moral reasoning, but a kind of practical reasoning. For example, when someone uses legal analogies.

On this point, Raz's position is quite subtle. He claims that if one admits the autonomy of legal reasoning, there may be no moral control over it. E.g., if judges decide a case by applying subjective preferences without following ideal principles to resolve the dispute legally. In this scenario, the courts might have incommensurable options (Raz [1993,](#page-91-0) 15). Other claims by Raz support this interpretation; for instance, he argues that legal reasoning should be governed by moral reasoning (Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 116), suggesting that the former is a part of a higher whole called practical

<sup>10</sup>If one reads Raz's early work on legal theory and then his later works, one notices changes in his argumentation. Whether he has maintained an unchanging view regarding his idea that legal reasoning encompasses these two types is debatable.

reasoning. Even later, Raz introduced some non-legal components to his framework, for example, by adding that a moral argument is required to defend the position that the necessary function of law is to ensure cooperation (Martin, [2014](#page-90-0), 164). He notes, moreover, that in well-organised societies, the law fulfils functions of social cooperation or coordination, which appear to be of a normative nature (Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 382–383).

Raz argued, in earlier work, against how some contemporary versions of American legal formalism understood the source-based conception of law. Like the preceding American formalists, this school supported the law's autonomy by developing a thesis on the autonomy of legal reasoning. They considered that the law was radically determined by the legislator. These authors stated that legal reasoning (mainly judicial) is distinctive, posing a suitably juridical logic that works as a rational activity. A legal conclusion is deducible logically from other laws. Raz described their programme on legal reasoning as "a type of technical reasoning obeying its own rules, like economic reasoning of reasoning about plumbing" (Raz [1993,](#page-91-0) 5). For Raz, this approach understood the sources thesis in a narrow sense as considering the law derives exclusively from or is dependent exclusively on the activities and intentions of law-makers (Ibid. 7). Raz insisted that this model of legal reasoning is not juridically autonomous but rather an instance of moral reasoning (Ibid, 15). Valuative reasons shall not "filter" legal reasoning to influence the law's determination. Consequently, the autonomy of legal reasoning is not a correct stance for positivism. The law's autonomy has no bearing on the supposed autonomy of legal reasoning. Raz even remarked that no serious author has ever argued that this type of reasoning may be autonomous (Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 379). For this author, the question of the law's autonomy relates to whether or not its content is determined independently of morality (Ibid, 381).

## 5.2 Autonomy of Law and Joseph Raz's Sources Thesis

The second thesis refers to the law's autonomy itself. It is related to an aspect of Raz's sources-based conception of law, to say that: "[a] law is source-based if its existence and content can be identified by reference to social facts alone, without resort to any evaluative argument" (Raz [1994](#page-91-0), 211; also Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 4). Raz upholds that "[t]he fate of autonomy (of law) is bound up with the fate of the sources thesis" (Raz [2009b](#page-91-0), 382 [brackets added]) in interrelation with the pre-emption thesis. Given this context, what is the source thesis, and how does it differ from the separability thesis? I will attempt to advance a response. However, understanding the author's position on law sources requires clarifications about why he dismissed the separability thesis; an exposition of Joseph Raz's social thesis arguments will be necessary for what follows.

Firstly, one must note that Raz rejected the separability thesis. In its most predominant versions, Raz considered the latter an implausible characterisation (Raz [1994,](#page-91-0) 227). The existence and content of the law are not at stake in the possibility of separating it from morality. Admittedly, "there is some necessary connection between law and morality" and "inherent connections between legal and moral concepts" (Raz [1994,](#page-91-0) 227, vii; also, Raz [2009a,](#page-91-0) 315). For this author, the law cannot but claim legitimate moral authority (Raz [1999,](#page-91-0) 149 ff.; Raz [2009b,](#page-91-0) 107). Notwithstanding, Raz concurs with the postulate of the absence of conceptual links. The law adequately defined does not need recourse to evaluative elements (Raz [1999,](#page-91-0) 164). Those arguments are particular features of Raz's approach. After addressing the shortcomings, Raz turned to the sources thesis as a less problematical positivist tenet. As a result, the separability thesis was discarded.

Secondly, Joseph Raz initially proposed the "social thesis" as a fundamental legal positivist principle. Compared to other approaches, it reflects better the character of law as a social institution. The raw elaboration is the following: "what the law is and what it is not is a matter of social facts" (Raz [2009a](#page-91-0), 37). Further developments and later versions thereof are not exclusive to him. Raz himself established nuances and distinctions. Initially, he drew attention to the "strong social thesis". Its formulation is the following: "[a] jurisprudential theory is acceptable only if its test for identifying the content of the law and determining its existence depends exclusively on facts of human behaviour capable of being described in value-neutral terms and applied without resort to moral arguments" (Raz [2009a,](#page-91-0) 39–40). Raz thought that this thesis was flawed. Its difficulties were associated with the insufficient specification of "tests" for the law's existence and identification based on social conditions. He pointed to distinguishing three essential ingredients for the tests: (a) law's efficacy, (b) law's institutional character, and (c) law's sources. Raz saw that some legal positivists were ambiguous, especially toward (c). They focused on conditions (a) and (b) for the law's social foundations. He called that movement the "weak social thesis"; it also falsely characterises legal positivism. Hence, for a better framing, Raz excluded conditions (a) and (b), concentrating on sources, which he denominated the "strong social thesis" (Ibid., 47). Such sources are facts whereby the law acquires validity or legal existence. Sources also make it possible to identify the law's contents (cf. Ibid., 47–48). At this point, it is unclear how facts endow normativity to the law.

Despite that, argumentation on the justification of the law's autonomy thus comes to a closure. The sources thesis excludes the likelihood of 'infecting' the law's content with evaluative ingredients. "[T]he truth or falsity of legal statements depends on social facts" (Raz [1994,](#page-91-0) 231). Making the legal ultimately dependent on the factual excludes the possibility of permeating the law's content by resorting to moral arguments. Legal positivism's claim to isolate law by making it autonomous (from morals) succeeds Raz's formulation. The social facts are value-free. Everything appears to fit. The "strong social thesis" is incompatible with any affirmation referring to the law's identification with moral arguments because those cannot be law sources. In this stance, the determination of the law's contents is not internally self-referential but dependent on external fact-based sources. Therein also lies the law's existence. In sum, for Raz, the law's autonomy relies on its legitimate authoritative factual character, which is the core of the nature of law. The legality's closure seems complete. Nonetheless, the dependence on social factuality for the law's determination remains. I will examine this situation in the next section.

## 5.3 Social Facts Dependence and Law's Autonomy

As explained, Joseph Raz rejected the possibility of autonomous legal reasoning. The author concluded that legal reasoning's strong meaning might be mostly evaluative, interpretative, or practical. Likewise, he affirmed the law's autonomy not through the separability thesis because it might be ambiguous but through the idea of social sources of the law. Raz believes that the sources thesis is the central antecedent for the autonomy of the law. Law is a system of rules whose content is identifiable without engaging in moral or political argumentation. The law's sources based on social facts structure the law's content and existence. Given the above, a question arises: what are the social facts in Raz's legal theory?

Primarily, one can think of the kind of empirically-based events given in the phenomenal world. These facts seem to be materialised by someone's will, which possesses political authority and community recognition. According to this standpoint, social facts are not moral facts. Through the human will mediation, those social facts adopted the form of law's sources, e.g., a statute's enactment, the administrative authorisation given by a public official or a judicial decision. These acts became legal facts without losing the property of being social facts. Here the legal operate supervenient, albeit not in an incompatible way, nor losing identity, on social facts. Examples may correspond to a meaning of social facts with connotations attributable to an individual's subjectivity, which is consistent with an author's definition: "the social facts can be understood to be contingent, descriptive facts about people's actual actions, utterances, dispositions, attitudes, and mental states [...] facts about the products that people have produced, such as facts about the meaning of the texts they have written" (Plunkett [2012,](#page-91-0) 145). Three related issues emerge here: (a) the puzzle of the passage from the factual to the normative; (b) the nature of the society's theory under discussion; (c) whether a type of reductivist legal narrative may be being adopted. I will briefly comment on them. Excessive synthesis indeed distracts both the sophistication and richness of the discussion. I will try to be as balanced as possible, given space limitations.

(a) The autonomy of law's normativity conundrum arises here. If one does not appeal to the law's normative self-referentiality, it will remain subject to another external phenomenon successively. In Raz's case, he addresses law's normativity as an agent's ability to identify legal rules as reasons for action because of the (political) authoritativeness of those rules. The law's closure seems to remain unrealised. If law ultimately depends on social facticity as direct human actions, certain precautions must follow from factual to normative. This movement is troublesome, and multiple authors have offered explanations. An answer might be the assumption of moral non-naturalism. An alternative is admitting that the law does not possess normativity. This movement is noticeable if one looks at Raz and other legal positivists who believe there is no obligation to obey the law. Obedience, then, seems to rest at last on the coercion enforced by legitimate practical (political) authority. Use of actual force as a measure of final resort. I will leave the question open and will not discuss this point further.11

(b) Calling on social facts implies a specific model of society as a reference. Different meanings of social phenomena emerge depending on the kind of society one has in mind. Choosing a liberal or a socialist model of society gives rise to a divergent understanding of the social milieu that may not inevitably be compatible. This situation means that social facts are not necessarily neutral in so far as those facts are also political. Social facts do not exist out of society politically organised. Otherwise, they would just be isolated brute facts that could be the subject of the natural sciences. No reputable author would reduce legal facts or social facts to a set of brute facts. Indeed, it is not Raz's case. Instead, Raz's account is similar to psychologism,12 which concentrates more on the empirical mental states of isolated subjects than their involvement in society. It presupposes a society model in which an agent alone determines societal elements without dialectical movements. This statement is so because of the following. Firstly, intentional acts of human will whereby the law's sources materialise rely upon agents' internal deliberation and individual attitudes and beliefs. Secondly, legal rules, which ultimately depend on facts-based social sources, are reasons for subjective action connected with a legitimate (practical) authority. For Raz, those movements underlie the law's normativity.

Such a connection of social facts with individual behaviour contradicts, e.g., Émile Durkheim's idea of social facts. This author linked them to society as a community that commits to beliefs and moral sentiments, whose law is but a reflection (Durkheim [2013,](#page-89-0) 20 ff.; Treviño [2019,](#page-91-0) 2). The concept of society behind the notion of social facts necessarily impacts the idea thereof. Thus, one may suggest that the kind of social theory that presupposes Raz's claims about social facts is not problematised thoroughly, especially considering that it is not an uncontroversial concept. Raz's writings on political and social philosophy suggest that the idea of society underlying his oeuvre may align with liberalism. The question is whether liberalism is an adequate theory of society. This state of affairs also raises questions about whether a more satisfactory understanding of the nature of law might be achieved through social philosophy or sociological jurisprudence. I will confine myself to posing doubts because answers are beyond this essay's scope.

(c) The law seems unable to detach itself entirely from reductionism to social facts. Some complexities appear at this stage. Firstly, legal facts depend on social facts that depend on other, more elementary facts in a continuous chain of successive

<sup>11</sup>A recent discussion on the transit from the factual to the normative in contemporary positivism can be found in Gizbert-Studnicki ([2021)](#page-89-0) 420 ff. Although without extensively reviewing Joseph Raz's approach. Suggestions on non-naturalism in Anglophone legal philosophy are found in M.S. Green [(2021)](#page-89-0), 277.

subordination. The law's derivate character poses a metaphysical feature. It represents an inexorable point for the autonomy argument. Analytical legal positivism enquiry closes itself when an agent descriptively identifies the posited factual elements. It does not suggest anything else behind the relationality and dependence on other phenomena (beyond sources). To this extent, the nature of law's derivativeness is traceable to types of metaphysical dependence, be it grounding, supervenience or reduction. Debate centres on the specific kind of derivability. The metaphysical controversy demonstrates the difficulties involved in the idea of legal autonomy based on the social sources' thesis. Further implications of the ongoing debate are significant for legal philosophy; I cannot elaborate on those issues here.13 However, it presents a tricky problem for Raz's legal positivism (as well as for Hart and other positivists). Such a qualm seems to be a blind alley for the above argumentation (cf. Greenberg [2004,](#page-89-0) 157 ff). Equally, the law model proposed based ultimately on social facts alone does not finally achieve the autonomy it claims. Its inability to offer a non-reductivist account makes the claim of law's autonomy unlikely. Once again, it seems that law is thereby rendered relatively autonomous.

Recapping, for Raz, law's autonomy is not at stake in the autonomy of legal reasoning. Instead, he proposed that the law's autonomy involves determining its content without using evaluative ingredients; that is the valid law. The exclusion of value-based components in determining the law does not mean that other elements are excluded. As a reductivist thesis, the factual sources keep opening the moment whereby the legal is permeated by the social, the political or the cultural. There is no full law's self-referentiality or self-sufficiency. Autonomy implies that the law is independent of valuational factors in its determination—non-connected with morals. However, the dilemma is that the theory engages a reductivism for determining the law that resorts to a necessary dependence on facts. Likewise, the claim is agnostic regarding the different meanings and theories about society involved in an assumption regarding social facts. Despite that, even if it were possible to commit to a concrete social theory, achieving a complete detachment of law from social facticity in the law's determination remains challenging. In this positivist framework, a strong autonomy thesis does not obtain because the law is not independent of social facticity. For any social or political theory, this seems redundant. What is curious is that legal positivism, which claims to isolate law from valuational and political components, ends up offering this kind of solution. Legal reductivism to social facticity leaves the autonomy of law as relative. Indeed, it is not a matter of understanding the law's autonomy as if it is radically divorced from society. Such a controversial affirmation would be audacious. The task is to assess the coherence of one of the fundamental claims of legal positivism on its own terms, immanently. Years earlier, in continental legal theory, there was a positivism that

<sup>13</sup>An elaborate treatment in recent philosophy of law is found in Gizbert-Studnicki [(2021](#page-89-0)) 429–440; Gizbert-Studnicki [(2016](#page-89-0)) 121–144; Pavlakos [(2017)](#page-90-0), pp. 139–160; Chivoli and Pavlakos [(2019](#page-89-0)) 53–76.

articulated a strong thesis of legal autonomy, which, notwithstanding its shortcomings, avoided some of the weaknesses of analytical legal positivism.

### 6 Hans Kelsen and the Autonomy of Law

The above exposed prompts the question of whether analytical legal positivism might adequately account for a postulate on law's autonomy that does not relativise itself. Neither Raz nor Hart seem to offer a satisfactory answer. However, early on, Kelsen's jurisprudential account founded in pure knowledge of law qua law suggests a persuasive theoretical framework for affirming a non-relative law's autonomy. The model has a self-closure mechanism founded in a logico-transcendental premise as epistemic presupposition —the hypothetical Grundnorm. It functions as a non-reductive source of normativity: "the normative validity of the whole system is to be derived from the Grundnorm presupposed, assumed, by legal science" (Ebenstein [1945,](#page-89-0) 93). Law's content and existence ultimately conform to the Grundnorm. That movement also provides reasons for arguing the autonomy of law's normativity.

The advantages of this theoretical account for law's autonomy are the following. Firstly, it does not need any recursivity or relational determination to other phenomena based on social facticity to set the law (non-factual thesis). Secondly, it poses a broad epistemological ground to plainly state the law's separation from moral facts and other normative orders (separation thesis). Hence, asserting the law's autonomy does not need to rely on social facts nor accept any class of connection with morals or politics. In the interest of brevity, in what follows, I will present two related arguments in a very condensed form that allow me to reconstruct Kelsen's claim to law's autonomy: juridical imputation principle and separation from non-legal normative orders. I shall, however, first describe some of Kelsen's methodological premises.14

## 6.1 Kelsen's Methodology

Hans Kelsen's Reine Rechtslehre's general aim was to show the possibility of knowledge of the law as such. It proposed an epistemological approach to the nature of law as cognition. Kelsen sought to scientifically cognise it in its pure state, apart from any extraneous elements; the law must be "freed" [befreien] from non-legal ingredients such as ideologies, psychology, sociology, morals or politics. Those fields were considered impurities for true legal knowledge. For Kelsen, the non-pure

<sup>14</sup>In this section, I will not assess the various long-documented shortcomings of Kelsen's theory of law.

comprehension of law was the central problem of legal science at the time. He saw that one methodological strategy to redress the trouble was to separate positive law from the realm of nature. Pure Theory (of law) idea is the rational presupposition of scientific work, whereby non-legal matters in the apprehension of law shall exclude. Scientific knowledge leads to an intellectual elaboration of law that makes it fully autonomous in its self-determination. Pure Theory's advantages provide a solid basis for arguing legal autonomy and the normativity of law. At least in its initial jurisprudential writings, Kelsen insisted several times that the Pure Theory liberates the law from nature and morals, ensuring, thus, legal autonomy (cf. Kelsen [2008,](#page-90-0) 3, 24, 33–34, 44, 47).

Kelsen's task in developing the project was twofold. Firstly, criticising the continental tradition of natural law; secondly, questioning the classical approaches of empirical positivism. The former is based on an all-encompassing view of a static natural order that gave law an inherent moral character. The latter reduces the legal order to an exclusively naturalistic claim based on facticity. In these circumstances, Kelsen thought about elucidating and giving specificity to the legal phenomenon qua law by separating it from morality and the factual. The law does not depend upon facts (Kelsen [1945](#page-90-0), 111–113), nor is it embedded in other normative orders such as morality (Kelsen [1960,](#page-90-0) 60–71).15 Law's existence is entirely independent of these phenomena.

This clear demarcation lies in the neo-Kantian Sein/Sollen duality replicated by Kelsen's legal theory as the need to distinguish between the extra-legal factual (Sein) and the normative law sphere (Sollen). According to Kelsen, we are all aware of the difference, and no further explanation of the assumption is possible (Kelsen [1960](#page-90-0), 4). This explicit distinction between two worlds is fundamental for the whole kelsenian system. For instance, it allows us to grasp the category of imputation as purely juridical, i.e., it only belongs to the realm of the Sollen. 16 Legal concepts exist only in that domain. However, it may be possible to identify an actual correlate in the world of Sein. E.g., the act of maliciously taking someone else's property without consent is translatable into law under the legal norm that punishes theft (Vesting [2015,](#page-91-0) 1–2). However, both the action and the valid juridical norm are neither equivalent nor derivable from each other. The former and the latter are independent spheres. Here, the fate of legal autonomy is at stake.

<sup>15</sup>I quoted only one of Kelsen's major works. The sharp separation between law and morality is a recurrent argument in several of Kelsen's writings throughout his oeuvre and is not limited to the texts I have mentioned here.

<sup>16</sup>I will come back to this in more detail later.

## 6.2 Kelsen's Peripheral Imputation Doctrine

Kelsen distinguished, on the one hand, natural science (namely empiricism and psychologism) underpinned by the causality principle and, on the other, legal science informed by the imputation [Zurechnung] doctrine. Imputation is a transcendental normative category that bonds the factual with external human acts. "The idea of imputation as the specific connection of the delict with the sanction is implied in the juristic judgment that an individual is, or is not, legally responsible [zurechnungsfähig] for his behaviour" (Kelsen [1950,](#page-90-0) 3). To illustrate the distinction between what is natural and the legal normativity, Kelsen had earlier explained how the juridical idea of imputation works: "[i]f the mode of linking the facts in one case is causality, in the other, it is imputation, which the Pure Theory of Law recognises as the special lawness or lawfulness [Gesetzlichkeit] of law" (Kelsen [2008,](#page-90-0) 33–34).17 Here, Kelsen is explicit about the law's self-referentiality, showing that imputation (of liability) is a purely legal category. This case means the law's capability to selfproduce normative meanings: that is what lawness or lawfulness is all about. It is at this stage that the law's autonomy manifests itself neatly. Imputation within the legal order is central to avoiding reductivism to the factual. The link to normatively ascribing legal responsibility for fulfilling the legal condition is not natural causation but imputation as juridical normative self-reference. Kelsen was emphatic on this point, even though it may be an analogous process to the causal relation. The interrelation between the autonomy of law and the idea of imputation requires further explanation. I will try to offer an outline in what follows.

Conceiving the legal norm as a hypothetical judgment rather than an imperative (as moral rules would be) was central to Kelsen's Pure Theory programme. His account materialises the purpose of liberating law (and thus achieving legal autonomy) under that assumption. The hypothetical judgment is a structure that allows us to distinguish the object of legal science: legal norms. It expresses the particular linking of a conditional statement of fact with a conditional result. The legal norm, in this understanding, becomes the legal proposition [Rechtssatz], which adopted the basic form of laws (Kelsen [2008,](#page-90-0) 33).18 In this regard, Somek pointed out that "Rechtssatz is not the sentence reporting what the law requires but the type of object that legal knowledge is prepared to accept as its proper object, namely, as a legal norm [...] The object needs to be presented in a manner that preserves normativity while holding it distinct from morality" (Somek [2017,](#page-91-0) 62). The interplay of these elements lies at the core of what Pure Theory and legal autonomy are all about. The link between factual conditional and consequence is not proper to natural sciences but is specifically juridical: peripheral imputation. It is a rational artificiality constructed by human reason. In Kantian terms, it is an apriori category that operates

<sup>17</sup>The original: "Ist die Weise der Verknüpfung der Tatbestände in dem einen Falle die Kausalität, ist es in dem anderen die Zurechnung, die von der Reinen Rechtslehre als die besondere Gesetzlichkeit des Rechtes erkannt wird." ([1934] 2008, 34). Supra I will comment on this.

<sup>18</sup>cf. Paulson [(1998](#page-90-0)), 163. He categorised this type of hypothetical judgment as object-distinction.

as an epistemic condition for the possibility of phenomena knowledge. It serves to distinguish and displace, let us say, the lawness or lawfulness of law, belonging to Sollen, from the legality of the natural, which belongs to Sein (Kelsen [1925](#page-90-0), 48–49).

This conception of law led Kelsen to affirm legal autonomy as a normative order and the autonomy of legal science concerning other disciplines. Kelsen presented a species of immanent legality of the contents of legal norms. Scientific activity for law knowledge does not mean reducing it to a set of purely descriptive causal explanations. For Kelsen, legal science relies on a transcendental apriori argument, namely normative imputation. This approach coincides with the above-mentioned neo-Kantian distinction between Sein (causality) and Sollen (imputation) as a fundamental working basis.

### 6.3 Kelsen's Separation Thesis Through the Idea of Legal Validity

In the later development of his work, Kelsen was explicit regarding the separation thesis core. Unlike Hart and some of his interpreters, who admitted the separability, Kelsen was straightforward about separation. Kelsen's programme leaves no room for any moral o non-legal component, not even in contingent contexts. Kelsen's law closure is stouter than his British counterpart. Thus, Kelsen noted that: [t]he claim of separation of law and morality, law and justice, means that the validity of a positive legal order is unrelated to the validity of this one, solely valid, absolute morality, "the" morality, the morality par excellence" (Kelsen [1960,](#page-90-0) 68). Kelsen also contended, a time before, in an introductory article for the anglophone audience, how Pure Theory primarily entails the separation of law from morality. "[W]hat is here chiefly important is to liberate law from the association which has traditionally been made for it —its association with morals. This is not, of course, to question the requirement that law ought to be moral. That requirement is self-evident. What is questioned is simply the view that law, as such, is a part of morals and that therefore every law, as law, is in some sense and in some measure moral" (Kelsen [1934,](#page-90-0) 481 [italics added]).

Kelsen's insistence on the strict separation between law and morality outlines his conception of complete legal autonomy. He wants to show here that, in so far as no sharp contrast between the two normative orders, in all cases, wherever is a confluence of legal and moral norms, it could amount to the concurrence of a single practical order. This situation would render law redundant, and its norms would not realise the legal consequence of the unlawful act. Besides, no real legal-scientific knowledge is possible in such a hypothesis because there would be no research object. Thus, the author wrote that: "[t]o consider law and morality from one and the same point of view as valid orders, or, what amounts to the same thing, to accept law and morality as simultaneously valid systems, means to assume the existence of a single system comprehending both" (Kelsen [1945,](#page-90-0) 374). Identifying legal norms as objective meanings reflects his conception of constructive jurisprudential activity as pure normative science. As an objective scientific field, the law needs its own object of knowledge, namely legal norms, which require unequivocal identification, separation and delimitation from morals, religion, and customs. Legal norms are never moral norms. Otherwise, contradictions and non-logical consequences unfold, and ideological or religious agendas contaminate the law and render it impure. Legal science would become objectless, ergo trivial. Thus, true knowledge of the law becomes unattainable.

Hans Kelsen's position on strict separation is understandable considering his epistemological account regarding moral propositions and legal norms as autonomous spheres of meaning. Legal norms address an agent's behaviour. "The Pure Theory of Law [...] considers legal norms not as natural realities, not as a fact in consciousness, but as meaning-contents [...] it considers facts only as the content of legal norms, that is only as determined by the norms. Its problem is to discover the specific principles of a sphere of meaning" (Kelsen [1934,](#page-90-0) 478). The author believed that moral propositions were not susceptible to rational justification or scientific corroboration. Admittedly, he thought moral statements were irrational and radically subjective, e.g., people reasonably disagree on justice means or demands. Conversely, juridical propositions, e.i., the legal norms, might be objects of scientific cognition in as much as they are endowed with an objective dimension attained through the idea of Geltung or validity. Upon this basis, the entirety of Kelsen's legal theoretical framework rests. Legal norms exist and are binding only if they satisfy a formal pre-established procedure (Kelsen [1968,](#page-90-0) 1427). Law's validity is tested by how the legal norms are self-determined. Other anterior legal norms authorised their validity on the same grounds. The process continues in succession until they reach the postulated supra-positive Grundnorm, the definitive validity source of all legal norms (cf. Kelsen [1945,](#page-90-0) 110–115).

On the contrary, moral rules do not possess this dimension of formal validity, nor could they be a matter of objective meaning. For Kelsen, unlike his Anglo-American legal positivist peers, the law's validity does not ultimately depend on exogenous content. Neither individual psychological processes nor mental events are involved. Social facts, moral facts or values do not determine or impinge legal validity. Rules are not a source of specifical juridical normativity as reasons for an agent's actions. Under Kelsen's scheme, it is sufficient that the law determines itself following the formal procedure established by the Grundnorm (cf. Kelsen [1951,](#page-90-0) 653). This step works as a formal character of legal creation. The facts that might be the source of the law's content are always contingent, non-determinant, and meaningless external materials before legal validation. At this point, what arises is that the Pure Theory constructs a type of legal normativity that is utterly distinct from moral normativity. The autonomy of law's normativity is at the centre of the theory. The normativity of law is not dependent on an outward practical authority because it is self-generated. Law and morality are two autonomous normative spheres. There is no possibility of any relevant connections or external dependency.

## 6.4 Recap

According to the reconstruction proposed in this paper, Hans Kelsen's idea of legal autonomy manifests through two arguments. They refer to the twofold dimension whereby Kelsen detached law from other phenomena: (i) from the dominant moral and political ideologies; (ii) circumventing the reductionism of the social sciences. The first appeals to the notion of imputation as the typically juridical element wherewith the autonomy of the law is expounded. The second refers to the autonomous dimension of legal validity that maintains a sharp separation between law and non-juridical normative orders. The notion of juridical validity [Rechtsgeltung] in Kelsen is crucial because it determines an exclusive property of the legal norms that may impact their peculiar ontological nature in the realm of Sollen. There is where the second aspect of the autonomy of the law lies—the law's specific existence (its validity) based on the presupposed Grundnorm. "The quest for the reason of validity of a norm leads back not to reality, but to another norm from which the first norm is derivable" (Kelsen [1945,](#page-90-0) 111).

Although Kelsen stresses the epistemological character of his theory, the ontological implications are explicit—especially when demarcating the metaphysical non-dependence on the factual. These assertions entail that questions about the ontology of the juridical come into play when he refers to law's existential dimension. This is a problematic peculiarity of Kelsen's philosophy of law. The following sentence is unambiguous in this respect: "[t]o speak [...] of the 'validity' of a norm is to express [...] the specific existence of the norm, the particular way in which the norm is given, in contradistinction with natural reality, existing in space and time" (Kelsen [1992,](#page-90-0) 12 [emphasis added]).19 For Kelsen, validity is the criterion that allows us to distinguish a legal norm from mere social practices, morals or customs. Simultaneously, it denotes that it would be erroneous to reduce legal norms to mere empirical facts within the natural causal realm. Kelsen's conception of validity might explain why he wrote that one law quirk is the self-regulation of its own creation: law and only law produces law—the law's self-reproduction. For "[i]t is a peculiarity of the law to regulate its own creation." (Kelsen [1951,](#page-90-0) 654).

A few comments and questions will help to summarise and clarify the argument. Kelsen did not initially use in the German language the concepts Autonomie or Legalität (as the quality of laws of any kind) to refer to the autonomy of law, but the words Eigengesetzlichkeit and Gesetzlichkeit. No translation can correspond precisely to the original concepts. Albeit, one might say that those terms denote the law's pureness to determine and reproduce itself as a proper juridical normative order: self-lawness or self-lawfulness (note that Kelsen even used a unique legalistic vocabulary). Furthermore, as the self-constructed legal norms are the exclusive

<sup>19</sup>The original: "Wenn im Vorhergehenden von einer "Geltung" der Norm gesprochen wird, so soll damit zunächst nichts anderes ausgedrückt werden als die spezifische Existenz der Norm, die besondere Art, in der sie gegeben ist; zum Unterschied von dem Sein der natürlichen Wirklichkeit, das in Raum und Zeit verläuft." ([1934] 2008, 20).

object of scientific enquiry, the law is also an autonomous (pure) discipline of knowledge. The Kelsenian model is self-contained and provides a coherent argument for legal autonomy. It is a flawless well-structured discourse based on the idea of pureness and one of Kelsen's most outstanding theoretical achievements. It does not fall into the dependence problem nor admit relevant connections with non-juridical normative orders. The autonomy of law is not relative but complete. Nevertheless, this type of radical autonomy might generate controversies with another autonomy conception: the rational personal autonomy that is a core component of the rule of law ideal as an amalgam of its formal and substantive versions (Tasiouslas [2020](#page-91-0), 132–135). Such tension might occur if the law's closure on itself goes too far to a great extent. How would that be achievable? Is it inexorable?

The following paragraphs pose questions about the potential difficulties that a scheme law's autonomy without relativisation based on Kelsen's legal theory might trigger. The paper will not attempt to offer formulas or solutions. Instead, it aims to present queries for future research to address obstacles that might hinder the interplay between legal autonomy and personal autonomy.

### 6.5 Some Potential Difficulties of the Non-Relative Autonomy of Law

In this subsection, I will attempt to articulate a possible troublesome upshot if the idea of the law's autonomy, in the non-relative fashion proposed by Kelsen, is taken to an intensification.

To admit the claim to the autonomy of law would imply that a legal system may self-enclose itself. Law's self-determination would risk an impervious closure to any possible interaction with the social environment, politics, and non-legal normative spheres. This programme was, to some extent, Kelsen's aim. The historical and social context in which Kelsen developed his theory may explain why such a scholarly enterprise followed. However, paraphrasing Alexander Somek's suggestion ([2017,](#page-91-0) 64), this conception of legal autonomy leaves law like a lacklustre machine-like artefact with high reflexivity without enough responsiveness. Hence, the law presents itself as a radically formal and self-reflexive construction that, without being driven by any valuable purpose and without paying heed to whether it is responsive to social malaise, only ends up serving itself, i.e., replicating the legal norm's condition that dictates that a legal consequence must follow—nothing more, nothing less.

Such imperviousness of autonomous law may render it untameable. According to Jeremy Waldron's argument ([2021,](#page-91-0) 126–127), it may lead to the possibility of the rule of laws itself rather than rule by people. If one expresses it in the language of political theory, the conundrum involves the tension between rule by law and rule of law.20 An autonomous law risks blind seclusion and may not necessarily be responsive to subjective rights, i.e., freedoms embodied as human rights norms. A selfreflexive law, without conciliation with rational autonomy, i.e., being limited to developing substantial degrees of responsiveness, may dissociate from the normative basis for social coexistence. It may become a rigid formalism unsuitable of responding to conflictive situations where the legal system does not offer a sound solution. In the same way, an automated autonomous law threatens to totalise or monopolise other normative orders under the complete juridification of all non-legal domains. Accordingly, the idea of the rule of law based on rational personal autonomy is elemental to the proper functioning of a true radical democracy. It may moderate the possible excesses to which the formal closure of law may lead.

To some extent, what I have exposed may explain why authors such as Hart, Raz, and other scholars have relativised the claim to law's autonomy. Even at the price of ambivalence in one of their arguments about law's distinctiveness. These authors tried to bridge a tension that seems irremediable and constitutive. Now, these shortcomings were not Kelsen's project in any case. Quite the contrary, Kelsen was not agnostic, and his later work was a consistent defence of democratic values and the idea of justice even though he deemed them non-legal constructs. Notwithstanding, his theoretical system may experience these outcomes in the case of full legal order automation. Relative law's autonomy seems inevitable to keep Anglo-American analytical legal positivism's internal coherence. Therefore, the question is how to coherently assert a responsive and reflexive law's autonomy without simultaneously denying it through its relativisation.

### 7 Concluding Remarks

According to the reconstruction above, the law does not complete substantial autonomy. Although not explicitly stated, H.L.A. Hart and Joseph Raz indirectly alluded to the law's autonomy through two of their emblematic theses in the analytical jurisprudence tradition. One was negative, the other positive: (i) separability from morals; (ii) sources founded in social facts. These two theses raise a few doubts as arguments for a strong statement of legal autonomy. Firstly, the separability thesis asserts that the law's content and existence are not necessarily related to morals. As proposed by Hart, this separability tends to become hazy if this contention means there might be as many contingent connections as intersections in a non-conceptual setting. Where is the law's autonomy when the law might link with morals? It seems the claim becomes narrow. Secondly, as Joseph Raz suggested, the

<sup>20</sup>Klaus Günther ([2019/2021)](#page-89-0) has discussed the vicissitudes of some constitutional democracies. He suggests an intermediate solution that takes advantage of what he calls a "productive tension" between (substantive) law and (formal) democracy. This paradox also evokes the old controversy between Ius and Lex or, as Franz Neumann's ([1937)](#page-90-0) formulation, the tension between the two moments of the rule of law: ratio and voluntas.

source-based conception of law claims to identify law's content and existence as exclusively dependent on legal sources grounded on social facts alone derived from positive human action. Some difficulties arose from this thesis. One is the legal reliance on the factual; another is the dependency on exogenous phenomena in law's determination. How might the law be autonomous in as much as it metaphysically depends on social facts, institutional facts or non-legal facts that are not moral facts? The law's autonomy claim tends to be blurred.

For these authors, law's autonomy claim means, to a certain extent, that law is an order conceptually separable from morality and determinable by recourse to non-moral facts. Nonetheless, as I have tried to show, such an endeavour is, to a certain extent, troublesome and does not lead to the viability of discourse on non-relative legal autonomy. For legal positivism, the law is autonomous, but it is also non-autonomous. The form the two authors formulated the issue, the constancy of dependence and relationality, renders autonomy redundant. Hence, relativisation emerges as an intermediate category that assumes dependence on something that is not exclusionary of relations with other orders. Analytically, it is challenging to think of something autonomous that is non-autonomous simultaneously. The law's autonomy will remain unrealised since it cannot be utterly detached from dependence on social facts, nor can it be autonomous beyond conceptual separability. Thus, the idea of law as a self-referential normative order loses momentum.

Admitting the relativisation of the law's claim to autonomy may even seem a truism. Intuitively it does not seem easy to conceive a radical autonomous law. One might argue that law's determination involves a degree of dependence on and relationality with non-juridical fields. The law places itself in social interaction. Autonomy does not mean autarchy or total isolation. As Bix has noted, one may state that the claim of complete autonomous law is nothing but archaic and outdated jargon reminiscent of the old formalism and certain recalcitrant positivisms. Only the "relative" autonomy of the law is defensible (Bix [2003,](#page-89-0) 985). However, this observation might be enhanced by introducing a distinction between law's independence and autonomy. An entity may not depend on another body (in-dependēre), but this does not necessarily imply that it can endow itself with laws (auto-nomos). There are different kinds of dialectical relationality between the juridical and cultural, economic, social and political orders. The interplay is necessary for the context of the law as a normative system of social relations. It is, therefore, necessary to draw the distinction and pose the conundrum dialectically. Affirming that there is a "relative" autonomy contradicts its concept. Instead of relativising the autonomy of law or discarding it altogether, it is reasonable to rethink the claim and develop suitable categorisations and methodologies.

In the early 20th century, Hans Kelsen put forward a theoretical model with a persuasive argument for non-relative legal autonomy. Kelsen's Reine Rechtelehre rests on the rejection of methodological syncretism. Law is determined and validated based on the Grundnorm of the legal order. Law possesses self-recursivity. Kelsen's programme did not fail when confronted with difficulties of the ultimate metaphysical determination of law because he did not reduce the law to social facticity. The theoretical approach was non-reductive and non-factual—the system dispensed the inclusion of non-juridical elements in determining the content of valid law. Likewise, it was a legal positivist project based on the sharp separation of normative orders. Indeed, Kelsen never wrote that law is not an integral part of society. Nor did he dismiss the impact of other human activities on the law. Quite the contrary, the Reine Rechtslehre admits the law's openness to political contingency under the idea of a dynamic procedural order when enacting legal rules. Therein lies the law's validity in its own right. For Kelsen, the law is self-contained in its establishment and its self-determination. This programme finds expression in the idea of Eigengesetzlichkeit and Rechtswissenschaft, which encompasses a legal system's self-determination and the law's status as an autonomous scientific discipline.

Despite these achievements, Kelsen's Reine Rechtslehre may abstract law to unreasonable levels, thoroughly disconnecting law from society's normative ideals. The law may lose its ratio if it closes on itself and turns blind to human material interests. Paraphrasing J. W. Harris' critique of Kelsen ([1996,](#page-90-0) 99–103), the law's normativity may become powerless when faced with the automation of the law's strict formal structure. The law's intense reflexivity without responsiveness to basic normative standards that neutralise the possibility of eventual arbitrariness in personal autonomy is latent in Kelsenian legal autonomy. The complete autonomous law has the potential to become a "cold-blooded" order. The internal logic of this autonomous law, which closes in on itself, might be prone to the non-realisation of personal autonomy. Such a situation leads us to an immanent contradiction in the possibility of the law's autonomy concretisation. Even if it is a sound claim, it seems practically unworkable. Kelsen's objective model is theoretically successful but risks overly formalisation and self-closure. Whereas Hart's and Raz's approaches seem plausible, they nevertheless pay the price of discursive ambiguity concerning their own theoretical programmes' aims.

The autonomy claim is a horizon for the law's realisation in an emancipatory form. Nevertheless, according to the authors' theories examined in this paper, it does not seem achievable. Even if one accepts that it is sufficient to claim autonomy solely to become apart from morality, there are still unresolved questions as to whether and to what extent, if so, are there connections or relations of dependence regarding the law's determination vis-à-vis the realm of politics, the diversity of pluralist societies and the effects of global capitalism. In such cases, the quandaries multiply, and achieving the law's autonomy becomes intricate. The continuing ambivalence that underlies the modern law's status is what we have seen so far throughout this text. Its claim to genuine autonomy conflicts with the law's continual necessity for recursiveness to morality, politics, society, or economics. Modern law's contradictory character shows its symptoms in the vicissitudes that legal positivism theory has undergone, especially in its Anglo-American version. As a dominant tradition, it is remarkably ambivalent in its treatment of the autonomy of law as it introduces a problematic relativisation of the claim. Relativisation, which renders the idea of autonomy superfluous, seems to emerge as the middle ground between two tensioned poles. This complexity raises questions: whether and to what extent it is feasible to conceive of a true autonomous law reconciled with personal autonomy. This movement, in turn, reflects the two conflicting moments of modern law: objective law and subjective rights, coercion and freedom. Much work remains to be done to overcome this tension.
