# Models of Consensus and Compromise on Human Rights and Dignity

![](_page_25_Picture_1.jpeg)

João Cardoso Rosas

Abstract The theorization of the possibility of a world consensus on human rights and dignity (in connection with human rights) has given rise to different normative models. In this chapter, I take these models as interpretive—rather than normative and I apply them to a specific argumentative setting: the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since none of the models examined—strict consensus, incompletely theorized agreements, and overlapping consensus—proves to be fully satisfactory in the interpretation of what happened in that particular historical moment, I also consider two complementary models, which emphasise the role of compromise over the idea of consensus, namely modus vivendi and moral modus vivendi.

The debates on the possibility of a world agreement on human rights and the underlying concept of human dignity tend to concentrate on abstract models of consensus. These models include moral minimum views, overlapping consensus, and many others with variable meanings depending on the argumentational context in which they appear. Unavoidably these models are normative and they are attempts to rationally anchor our hope, in a Kantian sense, on a moral and universal endorsement of human rights.

There is nothing wrong with this kind of philosophical inquiry. On the contrary, I believe it is intellectually relevant and important for our common future. But in this chapter, I would like to propose a slightly different methodology. Instead of focusing on the merits and shortcomings of these models as normative projects, I want to examine the interpretative capacity that at least some of them may show to make sense of a specific historical and argumentative context. This context is the drafting process of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, taking place in the framework of the United Nations (UN), roughly between January 1947 and December 1948.

The drafting process of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights has received great attention from historians over the last two decades. Among others, Johannes Morsink has reconstituted the drafting process within the UN different bodies drawing on the official proceedings (Morsink [1999)](#page-36-0). Mary Ann Glendon has contributed with a probing description of the workings of the Human Rights Commission, drawing on the personal archive of Eleanor Roosevelt, the Chairwoman of the Commission (Glendon [2002)](#page-36-0). Harvard historian Samuel Moyin has revised our understanding of the drafting process and also of the fate of human rights law and discourse after 1948 (Moyin [2010](#page-36-0)). Philosophers can now benefit from these and other contributions to test their agreement theories on human rights in this particular context.1

In the following pages, I will briefly describe the context and the main lines of dispute within the United Nations different bodies, with special attention to two settings: the Human Rights Commission and the Committee on the Theoretical Basis of Human Rights.

Against this background, I will test some models of consensus, including those suggested by John Rawls, Charles Taylor, and Cass Sunstein to make sense of what happened in those founding moments for the definition of human rights and dignity in the context of human rights law. In the end, I will introduce two other interpretive models, which may be better described as forms of compromise (rather than consensus).

### 1 The Main Setting

When the delegates of fifty states met in San Francisco, in 1945, to create the United Nations, human rights were not at the centre of the enterprise. Human rights had not been relevant in the framework of the Society of Nations created after the Great War and the prevailing powers at the end of World War II, the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union were not particularly keen on giving human rights a predominant role because these rights would create limitations on their sovereignty, both at home and abroad, including in their colonies or other territories under their jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, smaller or less powerful states, together with civil society organizations and the academic community, insisted on the idea of giving a special place to human rights in the United Nations Charter. As a consequence, the document includes references to the "faith in fundamental human rights" and, what is more, "in the dignity and worth of the human person". 2 Within the UN structure, the

<sup>1</sup> Glendon's account of the process was particularly useful for the writing of this chapter.

<sup>2</sup> According to Charles Beitz, the introduction of this reference to dignity was the proposal of an American delegate and dean of Barnard College, Virginia Gildersleeve. See Beitz ([2013,](#page-36-0) p. 266). See also Moyin ([2013)](#page-36-0).

promotion of human rights is entrusted to the Social and Economic Council, which ended up creating a Human Rights Commission, in 1946, whose first task was to draft an International Bill of Human Rights. Eleanor Roosevelt, one of the American delegates at the UN, appointed by President Truman, was elected Chair of this Commission, composed of delegates of eighteen countries from different continents and with distinct religious and philosophical traditions.

In the first meeting of the Human Rights Commission, held at Lake Success, New York, from January 27 to February 10, 1947, the French delegate René Cassin set the tone of the discussion by insisting that a Human Rights bill required "the affirmation of the common human nature and the fundamental unity of the human race" (Glendon [2002,](#page-36-0) p. 39). Cassin's position engaged in particular one of the most influential members of the Human Rights Commission throughout the drafting process, the Lebanese delegate Charles Malick, who said: "we are raising the fundamental question, 'what is man?.' When we disagree about human rights we are really disagreeing about the nature of the person. Is man merely a social being? Is he merely an animal? Is he merely an economic being?" (ibid.).

Notice that the question about the nature of man is posed by both Cassin and Malick as a previous and necessary issue in order to write a Human Rights declaration. Cassin, a learned and experienced lawyer, and Malik, a professor of philosophy trained at Heidelberg and Harvard, both agreed that some kind of doctrinal foundation, i.e., some answer to the question "what is man?" was a sine qua non condition for the definition of the content of the declaration. Disagreement about rights, then, could only be solved by a more fundamental agreement on the nature of the subject of those rights.

This debate went on not just during the first plenary meeting of the Commission but also in the private meetings of the so-called "triumvirate", which coordinated the task of the Commission for some months and was composed by Charles Malik himself, the Chinese delegate P. C. Chang (from Nationalist China), and the President of the Commission and widower of the former President of the United States, Eleanor Roosevelt.

The terms of the debate may be summarized as follows:

On the one side, stood those whose view was influenced by European modernity, stressing the individual human being as a subject of pre-political rights, as a moral being, not just an animal being and not a social being only. This view was represented by Malik in the triumvirate, but also by Cassin and others.

For the sake of simplicity, one may call this "the Western" view.

On the other side, stood those whose view was that of the nature of man as a social being in the first place, against the individualism of the western approach. The defenders of this view were of two completely different kinds.

Firstly, there were the Marxists, representing not just the Soviet Union but also other socialist countries, who stressed the pre-eminence of society and even the state over the individual. For instance, the delegate from Yugoslavia, Vladislav Ribnikar, said that "the common interest, as embodied in the state, takes priority over individual claims". And he further suggested that the individualist view is an instrument of capitalist exploitation. "The psychology of individualism – he said - has been used by the ruling class in most countries to preserve its own privileges" (Glendon [2002,](#page-36-0) ibid.).

Second, there were the Asian representatives who voiced a very different worldview, but who coincided with the Marxists in their critique of the individualism of the Enlightenment perspective. The Asian view was usually supported by Confucianism and one of the people who presented it was P.C. Chang, the representative from China and also a member of the triumvirate. Chang was well known for citing old Chinese proverbs and Confucian philosophers stressing the relevance of the sense of community. Nevertheless, his vote was more often aligned with the Western powers, although he would also abstain when there were strong divisions between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Several delegates in the Human Rights Commission were imbued with a practical spirit and they abhorred these kinds of philosophical disputes that so thrilled some of its most influential members. One of the practically-orientated delegates was the President, Eleanor Roosevelt. When the triumvirate met on private terms she would let Malik and Chang discuss their conflictual conceptions of human nature in heated terms, while she remained silent. Then, she would take practical decisions to advance the drafting process. In the plenary meetings of the Commission, Eleanor Roosevelt tried to appease the disputing parties. After listening to the disputes for hours in the first plenary meeting she said: "It seems to me that in much that is before us, the rights of the individual are extremely important. It is not exactly that you set the individual apart from his society, but you recognize that within any society the individual must have rights that are guarded." (Glendon [2002,](#page-36-0) p. 40).

Eleanor Roosevelt's personal convictions were aligned with the Western view, but she was clearly interested first and foremost in getting her job done, i.e., in reaching a draft of a Human Rights bill to submit to the other bodies of the UN and, finally, to be voted on by the General Assembly. Her approach was practical, not doctrinal, and she acted accordingly.

In view of deep doctrinal disagreement regarding human nature, instead of continuing the debate to reach some kind of substantive consensus, Mrs. Roosevelt opted for circumventing disagreement and proceeding immediately to the first draft of a list of rights to be included in the Human Rights bill. This task was committed not to members of the Commission but to an important member of the UN Human Rights staff, the Canadian constitutional lawyer John Humphrey.

Humphrey and his aides worked tirelessly to synthesize previous declarations in the different constitutional traditions around the world, pre-existing human rights instruments, and proposals from civil society. The result of their work was impressive because they listed not only the rights but also all the sources that could be considered in the different constitutional traditions. The draft prepared by Humphrey contained a tentative Preamble and forty-eight articles without a special place for the notion of dignity, but with an extensive list of rights. The full text, with the sources for those articles, was massive. The drafting committee—composed of the triumvirate representing the United States, Lebanon, and China, plus the representatives of Australia, Chile, France, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union—and the full Commission had plenty to read and to work on.

### 2 Expectations of Consensus

Let us pause to consider the interpretive model that may account for what happened in the inaugural months of the Human Rights Commission as described above. Its most outspoken members involved in doctrinal disputes started with a firm belief in what may be called a strict consensus model. In other words, they believed that a consensus on the same doctrinal basis was required to reach a consensus on a list of rights and the underlying concept of humanity. Remember that, despite their doctrinal disagreements, the members of the Commission insisted on the idea that a consensus on the nature of man was needed in order to establish a bill of rights.

It is not difficult to understand that this approach blocked the advancement of the process. In doctrinal matters, the more we discuss, the more we tend to disagree.3 Therefore, no agreement on rights and the idea of man would be feasible this way. The Chairwoman of the Commission, Eleanor Roosevelt, understood this intuitively and her decision to move swiftly to the completion of a first draft list of rights and general principles inaugurated an altogether different approach. Instead of seeking a basic doctrinal consensus, she favoured an épochê of sorts regarding doctrinal matters, or what could be called, in Rawlsian terms, "a method of avoidance".

To fully understand the new model that is emerging here one has to consider the work of a parallel United Nations body that was convening also at the beginning of 1947 to discuss the doctrinal foundations of human rights specifically. The initiative came from the United Nations Education, Science and Culture Organization (UNESCO) director, Julian Huxley. UNESCO created the Committee on the Theoretical Basis of Human Rights chaired by the Cambridge historian E.H. Carr, including as its most influential member the French Thomist philosopher Jacques Maritain. The idea of the Committee was to work in parallel with the Human Rights Commission with a view to examining the philosophical foundations of the bill that was being drafted mainly in New York.4

The "UNESCO philosophers' Committee", as it became known, sent a written questionnaire to several relevant thinkers around the world, including the brother of the Director of UNESCO, Aldous Huxley, the French Jesuit philosopher Teilhard de Chardin, the Italian philosopher Benedetto Croce, the Mahatma Gandhi, the Confucian philosopher Chung-Shu Lo, the Bengali Muslim poet Humayun Kabir, and several others. The idea was to establish whether or not there was a common understanding of the doctrine behind an international bill of rights and also of the specific rights that should be included in that bill.

The questionnaire was sent all over the world in March 1947 and the answers didn't take long to arrive. The views expressed by the world philosophers confirmed the strategy followed by Eleanor Roosevelt in the drafting committee. The philosophers could not agree on the same doctrinal foundation—thus refuting in practical

<sup>3</sup> For a critique of strict consensus as unrealistic in a pluralist context, see Rawls ([1993,](#page-36-0) pp. xiii–xviii and 36–39).

terms the strict consensus model—, but this fact did not affect their adherence to a common list or rights. In this respect, what happened in the Human Rights Commission and the Philosophers Committee was remarkably similar. Agreement on a common list of rights emerged—slowly and through diplomatic negotiation in the Human Rights Commission, more quickly in the UNESCO Committee—, while disagreement on the doctrinal bases of such a list remained and was reaffirmed. But it was difficult to make sense of the apparent paradox of agreeing on a list of rights while recognizing the ever deeper disagreement on its doctrinal foundations.

Perhaps the best way to capture this apparent paradox is the idea, advanced by Cass Sunstein, of incompletely theorized agreements, and the way Sunstein developed this idea in the framework of Constitutional Theory (see Sunstein [2007)](#page-36-0). His central point of concern is how members of societies where people disagree about "the largest issues in social life" can live together in mutual respect under the same Constitution. The same kind of disagreement arose, on a global scale, in the drafting process of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Thus, it makes sense for Sunstein to use this drafting process as an example of incompletely theorized agreements.

Sunstein suggests that sometimes people can agree on abstract formulations—for instance, the general formulation of a right—while disagreeing on their particular meaning. Other times people agree on particular outcomes or practices but maintaining their disagreement on general issues regarding the right and the good. In this respect, Sunstein believes in the importance of the role of silence as a constructive force (instead of silence one could talk, in Rawlsian terms, of suspension of judgement, avoidance, abstention, or restraint). Something like this was going on in the drafting process of the Universal Declaration. The agreement on a list of rights, which occurred both on the UN Commission and on the UNESCO Philosophers Committee, referred to abstract principles—the rights themselves and other general principles, such as "human dignity"—and some outcomes of those rights, but not on a full meaning of those rights nor on their doctrinal foundation on a given conception of man. Silence over this was the only way to achieve agreements. These agreements were not completely theorized—"we agree on a list of rights - as reported by Maritain - but on condition that nobody asks us why" (UNESCO [1949](#page-36-0), p. 9).

This model of incompletely theorized agreements works at least to interpret part of what happened between 1947 and 1948. It is certainly more satisfactory than the strict consensus model, but it is not fully satisfactory, as I will try to suggest now. The diplomats at the UN Commission were certainly able to appreciate the role of silence, or restraint, to reach agreements on specific rights and their interrelations. This is, after all, the business of diplomacy. But the UNESCO philosophers, despite what Maritan said, as a witticism, about "not asking why", did not give up the "why" question. This was their business. As a result, the final report of UNESCO, written towards the end of 1948, took into consideration not just the general agreement on a list of rights but also the very diverse responses providing doctrinal foundations to the international bill of rights. According to the report,

the Committee is convinced that the philosophic problem involved in a declaration of human rights is not to achieve doctrinal consensus but rather to achieve agreement concerning rights, and also concerning action in the realisation and defence of rights, which may be justified on highly divergent doctrinal grounds. The Committee's discussion, therefore, of both the evolution of human rights and of the theoretic differences concerning their nature and interrelations, was intended, not to set up an intellectual structure to reduce them to a single formulation, but rather to discover the intellectual means to secure agreement concerning fundamental rights and to remove difficulties in their implementation such as might stem from intellectual differences. (UNESCO [1949,](#page-36-0) p. 263)

It is clear from this passage that the Committee accepts some kinds of incompletely theorized agreements (concerning both rights and their implementation), but it adds: "which may be justified on highly divergent grounds". The philosophers who responded to the UNESCO questionnaire were adamant in emphasizing their support for a human rights bill, although the reasons that each one of them invoked were clearly different and even at odds with the reasons invoked by others. Accordingly, the Committee points here to a very different model from the one advanced by Sunstein. The model proposed here is a form of overlapping consensus, in the sense of Rawls.5

Now an overlapping consensus is much more demanding than incompletely theorized agreements. In an overlapping consensus there is no giving up about full and deep justifications. These justifications exist and are central to the model, but they are plural rather than exclusive. An overlapping consensus requires two levels of justification. The first level concerns the freestandingness of the agreed principles. At this level, the principles are justified independently from philosophical or religious comprehensive doctrines, only in terms of (international) public reason and from ideas available in public culture. The second level of justification, though, is deeper and requires that the same principles are supported by different and even incompatible comprehensive doctrines, but each one from its own and particular outlook, with reasons that are exclusive and not necessarily shared or even accepted by other philosophical or religious doctrines.

The work of the UNESCO Committee suggests that an overlapping consensus regarding human rights was emerging in the world. One could perhaps say that the UN drafting body was operating at the level of international public reason, circumventing doctrinal disputes, whereas the Philosophers' Committee was building the remaining part of the overlapping consensus by providing the deeper doctrinal justifications from the vantage point of each one of the major philosophical and religious traditions of the world.

However, the real international situation in 1948 and afterwards did not match the idea of an overlapping consensus. In 1947, the American Anthropological Association (AAA) issued an official statement in which it said that the concept of human rights was distinguishably Western rather than shared by the cultures of the world. Many cultures do not possess the vocabulary nor the conceptual means to make

<sup>5</sup> For the idea of an overlapping consensus, see Rawls [(1993,](#page-36-0) Lecture IV).

sense of the very idea of an individual human right (see American Anthropological Association [1947)](#page-36-0).

Although the AAA later issued another statement that tried to make the kind of cultural relativism that is usually found among Anthropologists—and, particularly, in the mid-twentieth century—compatible with the existence of international human rights, the doctrinal and diplomatic disputes around the Western bias of the Universal Declaration and the treaties and declarations that followed it has never really stopped. Firstly, during the cold war and until 1989, there was the dispute between capitalist and socialist states regarding the relative importance and priority between first-generation and second-generation rights. Secondly, there are ongoing disputes regarding the incompatibility of the rights proclaimed in 1948—particularly firstgeneration rights—with Asian Values, or with Islamic Values. Finally, philosophical doctrines in the West, such as anti-foundationalism (e.g. Rorty [1993](#page-36-0)), have continued to dispute the possibility of doctrinal foundations for human rights. I cannot address these issues here, but to mention them is enough to suggest that a de facto overlapping consensus does not exist today and it did not exist in 1948.

This being said, the overlapping consensus may subsist as an ideal, rather than as an interpretive idea or a shared view.

Notice that the idea of an overlapping consensus was applied by Rawls to constitutional essentials and matters of basic justice in domestic settings. It was the merit of Charles Taylor to suggest that it could also be applied to a world consensus on human rights. However, when Taylor suggests this he is pointing to the ideal aspect of an overlapping consensus rather than to its supposed current existence. For instance, when he deals with a specific brand of Buddhism in Thailand, Taylor admits that even the notion of a human right is absent in that context, but then he proceeds by trying to find other notions that may be used to build doctrinal support for human rights from the vantage point of Thai Buddhism (cf. Taylor [1992](#page-36-0)).

### 3 Modalities of Compromise

While the UNESCO philosophers were exchanging their views, the UN Human Rights Commission proceeded with its task. The work of the Philosophers' Committee, important as is for philosophical reflection, was perhaps not very representative in its idealism, or utopian character, and did not have much impact on the Commission, which was engaged in the job of reaching a final text to be submitted to the General Assembly.

In June 1947, the Commission entrusted the French delegate René Cassin with the task of rewriting the extensive list of rights prepared by John Humphrey and presenting a coherent bill of rights. The "Cassin draft" 6 systematized the Humphrey

<sup>6</sup> For this draft and other drafts of the Universal Declaration, see Glendon [(2002](#page-36-0), pp. 271–309).

document in a clear and ordained form. It already contained a Preamble and a Proclamation, and the articles were divided into 46 items (instead of the 30 items of the final text). The idea of "dignity" or "equal dignity" of men was mentioned in the Preamble and article 1, but it had no special role in the text. The Cassin draft became the working document for the Human Rights Commission, but the work was still far from completion.

In November 1947 the plenary of the Human Rights Commission met again, this time in Geneva, where a new and shorter draft was approved, amidst bitter disputes between the western block and the block led by the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the process did not stop and the full Commission met again in New York, in June 1948, to prepare the final text to be sent to the other United Nations commissions and all the countries represented in the General Assembly. In this process, the Declaration saw further changes to accommodate demands from different countries and political sensibilities. In this complex procedure, it was the personal engagement of Eleanor Roosevelt, together with the diplomatic talent of the most influential members of the Commission, such as Malik, that allowed the document not to lose its coherence and remain faithful in its substantive content to the Cassin draft.

During this long and tortuous negotiation process, the idea of human dignity became central only at a late stage, when it was placed in the first sentence of the Preamble as "the inherent dignity" of "all members of the human family", besides continuing to be mentioned in other passages, in the Preamble and article 1. These latter mentions of "dignity" may be seen as mirroring the reference to dignity in the text of the 1945 UN Charter introduced by Virginia Gildersleeve (see note 2 above), and they do not play any relevant role in the Declaration. However, the idea of "inherent dignity" (emphasis added) seems to be more relevant and, for some, it is interpreted as having a foundational role for human rights. In any case, the kind of foundational role this idea may have was not established by the framers of the declaration. It would be abusive to establish that this particular idea has a specific meaning, whether it is the Kantian conception of dignity, the Catholic conception, or any other.

When the final document, now entitled the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights", was set to be voted on in the General Assembly meeting in Paris on December 10, 1948, many doubts remained about its faith. The international situation was complex, with the United States and the Soviet Union clashing on several fronts around the world. The international appeasement brought by the allied victory in 1945, which had allowed for the creation of the United Nations and the initiative to draft an international bill of human rights, was past. The delegates involved in the Human Rights Commission sensed the last opportunity before the world would be engulfed in the Cold War and the Nuclear Threat. According to Glendon ([2002](#page-36-0), p. 163), when Eleanor Roosevelt was entering the Palais de Chaillot, for the voting session of the General Assembly, she was still doubtful about whether the Declaration would gain approval, or at least about the number of votes against it would attract, which might have diminished the value of the document in the years to come.

The final vote came as a surprise. When the articles of the Declaration were voted on separately, there were few abstentions and only three articles got votes against: the article on non-discrimination, the article on the family, and the article on freedom of opinion and expression. When, finally, the Declaration was submitted to vote as a whole, there were no votes against and only eight abstentions (from the USSR, Ukraine, Byelorussia, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, South Africa, and Saudi Arabia). The socialist countries were still uncomfortable with the role of firstgeneration rights, directly connected with the conception defended by the western countries, and the limits they implied for state action. However, at the same time, those countries wanted to use the language of human rights to repudiate Nazism and fascism, and so they decided to abstain, rather than to vote against the Declaration. The common enmity towards Nazism and fascism was still able to unite socialist and western countries at the end of 1948. South Africa had problems with the principle of anti-discrimination, as it was at the time implementing the apartheid system. Saudi Arabia opposed the right to change religion and, in particular, equal rights in marriage. But these two latter countries decided to abstain since they would be isolated if voting against.

What sense can we make of all this uncertainty till the very end, on the night of December 10, 1948, in Paris? How can we make sense of the fact that the Declaration was approved with no votes against, although at the same time there was no strict doctrinal agreement, maybe some incompletely theorized agreements, or even the ideal of an overlapping consensus looming in some philosopher's heads, but apparently not among the diplomats who wrote the document?

I want to suggest that, to fully understand the process, one should complement consensus models with models of compromise. When no doctrinal consensus was obtained or perhaps could have been obtained on human rights and dignity, then only compromise can account for the fact that the Universal Declaration was approved in 1948 and has since then managed to become a central plank of the international legal system.

As distinguished from different forms of consensus, I take compromise here as synonymous with what Rawls calls "modus vivendi". 7 A modus vivendi is a strategic or political compromise. The example of a modus vivendi is a treaty between two states in which they reach an "equilibrium point". It is in the interest of both states to honour the treaty since its denunciation would be worse for the interests of each of the two states. Thus, a modus vivendi is not a moral agreement. Moreover, a modus vivendi is also less stable than a moral agreement. Following the same example, an international treaty may be broken by any of the parties once this turns out to be better for that party. A modus vivendi, then, amounts to a contextual convergence of interests.

The application of this model of compromise to an international negotiation such as the one that led to the approval of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights seems natural. After all, modus vivendi is the standard approach in (realist) International Relations Theory and it looks like a convincing account of at least part of what happened particularly in the UN Commission on Human Rights and, a fortiori, in the

<sup>7</sup> On compromise as modus vivendi, see Rawls [(1993](#page-36-0), pp. 147–149 and 158–163).

other sections of the UN where the draft prepared by this Commission was discussed, including the so-called Third Committee, the Economic and Social Council (or ECOSOC), and the General Assembly, both in special committees and in the plenary. In all these instances, the delegates of the different countries tried to defend the best interests of their states.

A reading of the proceedings of the Commission and the personal accounts of some of its members reveals that the discussions and voting were often guided by the manoeuvrings of the main powers, and also of some minor powers, understandable in terms of state interest, rather than by moral concerns, whether incompletely theorized or overlapping.

However, even if the consensus models are not fully convincing both as interpretations of what happened in 1947–1948 and perhaps also as solutions to the problem of disagreement regarding rights and doctrines, the idea of a pure modus vivendi is not the only alternative. One should not reduce the alternatives to a logical disjunction. The question is not about choosing between moral consensus and political or strategic compromise. Rawls makes too sharp a distinction between consensus and compromise by stating that consensus is moral, or perhaps political for the right reasons, whereas compromise or modus vivendi is strategic, or political for the wrong reasons. The problem with this distinction in Rawls is that he does not consider the possibility of a compromise or modus vivendi that is morally motivated. So, I will now briefly consider this model as a necessary and complementary interpretive grid for the agreement on human rights and dignity in the moment of their positivization in the international legal system, in 1948.

A moral modus vivendi—as I call it—is a model of compromise that does not imply substantive moral agreement regarding rights or doctrines, but requires moral commitment on the part of at least the main agents in the agreement. In a moral modus vivendi the parties cannot limit themselves to make strategic calculations. They must also be morally driven to reach some kind of understanding, even if they cannot agree on the precise and substantive content of the understanding.

Despite all the diplomatic manoeuvring in the Human Rights Commission and the United Nations at large, some of the key members of the drafting committee and even of the plenary Commission—including Roosevelt, Malik, Chang, Cassin, and several others—were extremely engaged in reaching a final bill of rights and affirming something like the idea of the dignity of man. As it became clear in the discussions, they would strongly disagree about the conception of man and society that lay below a list of human rights, or even about the true meaning and consequences of "inherent dignity". Moreover, they would also disagree on the meaning and relative importance of those rights. Nevertheless, driven by their distinct moral convictions—of a religious nature in many cases, philosophical and political in other cases—they were able to face the challenges of disagreement and the demands of the "raison d'état" and reach a final text to be submitted and voted on in the General Assembly of the United Nations.

This kind of morally motivated modus vivendi was also part of the game.
