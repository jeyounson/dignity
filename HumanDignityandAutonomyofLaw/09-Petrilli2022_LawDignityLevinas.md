# The Double Sense of the Law-Dignity Relationship in Emmanuel Levinas

![](_page_183_Picture_1.jpeg)

Susan Petrilli

I have never claimed to describe human reality in its immediate appearance, but what human depravation itself cannot obliterate: the human vocation to saintliness. ("Violence du visage", in Emmanuel Levinas, Alterité et transcendence, 1995[1985], Eng. trans. p. 180)

Human dignity cannot be violated. It must be respected and protected (The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights).

Abstract Dignity can result from an intrinsic quality: the dignity of a gaze, the face, associated with the single individual's intrinsic value, with singularity, with the I's respect for the other as other, even before the advent of positive law; or, it can derive from a social condition demanding respect, even obedience from others, dignity connected with a high office, with authority, social position. The law defends a role, social position, juridical position, an authority that is elected, nominated, inherited; the law defends the law itself; the law is law and is respected as such; dignity is the law itself. This double "position" of the law, this dual law-dignity relationship is a constant object of reflection by philosopher Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1995) throughout his writings, and is developed in this chapter around the following themes: dignity and responsibility; the relationship of reciprocal implication between "law"and "dignity"; original peace and authority of the face; when respect of the law becomes effacement of the other; freedom ensuing from responsibility for the other to the point of "substitution"; language, subjectivity, justice; language, face and ethics; the finite and the infinite; justice and signification; law as original recognition of the right of others; justice and responsibility; ambivalences of the face; body, algorithm and responsibility in the digital world; human rights, the problem of freedom and self consciousness; from need to desire; justice, love, saintliness; Levinas and Bakhtin for a humanism of the other; a view from semiotics; the relation to the other and semioethics.

### 1 Dignity and Responsibility

Dignity: a condition of respectability, integrity, honesty, propriety, value, stature, loftiness, highness, calibre, standing recognized of somebody by somebody else, human dignity. In social history the qualification or value or attribute "dignity" is often associated with interest, what Emmanuel Levinas also terms "inter-estedness," which consists in reducing "dignity" as a value to the qualification, the status of "identity". In this respect, referring again to Levinas, in particular his essay not incidentally titled "Droits de l'homme et droits de l'autre homme" [(1985a)](#page-213-0), something not very different occurs as regards human rights: human rights become the rights of identity, of belonging, of the I, to the exclusion of the other (cf. Levinas [1981,](#page-213-0) [1982d,](#page-213-0) [1982e;](#page-213-0) cf. also Petrilli [2019a)](#page-215-0). As in the case of "dignity," the other is excluded from "human rights" as well. And these two occurrences are obviously connected to each other.

By reattributing identity value to the person who must earn it and not just selfattribute it gratuitously, even arrogantly, that is, to the I as I, the I as "I am," Levinas evidences how dignity is a value based on the I recognizing the other, on recognizing the other as other. Dignity consists in recognizing the alterity of the other, of others, recognition which occurs when the I takes responsibility for the other. The other constitutes an absolute ethical imperative on the I. Consequently, such recognition is not a concession made by the I to the other, but the expression of inevitable involvement, compromise, implication of the I with the other and for the other, of non-indifference in the face of the other (cf. Arnett [2017)](#page-211-0). The I is bonded to the other in an intrigue, an entanglement that cannot be unravelled, in a relationship to the other without shelter.

In his essay titled Emmanuel Levinas and subtitled La scoperta dell'umanità nell'inferno dello Stalag 1492 (Discovery of humanity in the hell of Stalag 1492), Bernhard Casper observes that the unconditional dignity of each person, dignity that cannot be eliminated, consists in that person's responsibility for the other (Ibid., p. 34). Levinas says as much with a brief formula: "moi = responsabilité". This is responsibility that knows no limits, a "responsabilité illimitée". In Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence (1974), Levinas explains "unlimited responsibility" in light of his conception of language, with special reference to the distinction between "Said" and "Saying": unlimited responsibility comes from the hither side of my freedom, from a "prior to every memory," and "ulterior to every accomplishment," it comes from the non-present par excellence, the non-original, the anarchical, prior to or beyond essence. And he continues:

The responsibility for the other is the locus in which is situated the null-site of subjectivity, where the privilege of the question "Where?" no longer holds. The time of the said and of essence there lets the pre-original saying be heard, answers to transcendence, to a dia-chrony, to the irreducible divergency that opens here between the non-present and every representable divergency, which in its own way – a way to be clarified – makes a sign to the responsible one. (Levinas [1974](#page-213-0), Eng. trans., pp. 10-11)

This original, primal condition of responsibility in the face of the other, on which depends the I's dignity, a condition of participation, of preoccupation, unrest for the other, is not a condition that is easily endured. It is accompanied by the demand of interrogating the philosophical privilege of being, of identity, of calling one's own self to question and interrogating one's beliefs and certainties, as we tend toward the hither side of being itself and beyond being, prior to and ulterior to essence (Ibid., pp. 18–19; Ponzio [2006a,](#page-216-0) [2006b)](#page-216-0).

At the origin of laws, of the State is not the Hobbesian situation of homo homini lupus, but necessary recourse to delimitation of original responsibility for the other, to the equal distribution of original responsibility among many others (cf. Hobbes [1651)](#page-212-0). The I is not only in a relationship with one other, but, unfortunately for the I, with multiple others, not only "close", but also "distant", not only present here and now, but latecomers, others that arrive subsequently.

Human dignity calls for consideration relatedly to the dimension of alterity, absolute alterity: dignity is the problem of singularity, of the "properly human", it is the problem of responsibility. By contrast with other living beings, the human animal has the prerogative of bearing the weight of responsibility, that is, responsibility for the other, not only for one's neighbour, for one's similar others, but for life over the entire planet (cf. Petrosino [1998,](#page-215-0) [2016,](#page-215-0) [2017)](#page-215-0).

Each singularity is associated with responsibility for the other, but this is not responsibility of the I, circumscribed and safeguarded by alibis, hence limited, special, "technical" responsibility, as would say another philosopher of alterity, Mikhail Bakhtin ([1919,](#page-211-0) 1920–[1924,](#page-211-0) [1990)](#page-212-0), but unlimited, infinite responsibility. Reference here is to the responsibility that the alterity of the other, of others (autrui) provokes in me, the other in its singularity, in its non-functionality, in its absolute alterity, the other of the face in its nudity, as Levinas says. The I's unconditional and absolutely uneliminable, impenetrable dignity consists in responsibility for the other; it is given in the I's vocation for the other.

To contextualize human dignity in the dimension of the alterity of the other, of others—not relative alterity but the absolute alterity of the other "man", the other human being, of the other as other—means to recognize that this is a dimension, a condition that is prior to the dignity reached in relation to being and its multiple identities. Absolute alterity is a dimension that being and its identities presuppose: the I's social status, conquered through one's successes, fulfillment of one's capacities, competences, skills, through reaching one's goals, successfully completing tasks relative to social role, as established by a given official order, etc. (Facioni et al. [2015](#page-212-0)).

Instead, the Levinasian dimension of autrement qu'être, "otherwise than being" valorizes the dignity of singularity, the dignity of the uniqueness of each one, uniqueness that does not imply separation from the other, but instead the other's irreplaceability. Dignity depends on the other, it is given in the relation to the other it is the other who renders me special, singular, in an intrigue of relationships impossible to get free of, impossible to unravel. Impossible because the other comes without being called, beyond all prevision, calculation, possibility of control, outside being, outside identity, outside the subject (cf. Levinas [1961,](#page-213-0) [1968a,](#page-213-0) [1987a;](#page-214-0) Ponzio [2013)](#page-216-0). The other in its singularity, in its irreplaceability presents itself and surprises, astonishes; the other impedes closure of the totality, interrogates the certainties of totalitarian discourse, of truth, knowledge. In the opening to the other the I comes to consciousness, it reaches self-consciousness, becomes aware of itself, even of its own emotions, whether joys or sorrows.

### 2 The Relationship of Reciprocal Implication Between "Law"and "Dignity"

"Dignity" takes different meanings. It becomes dignity resulting from a given condition demanding respect, even obedience, from others: dignity relating to a high office, to a senior position, preeminence based on authority, on social status. Titles such as "Your Highness", "Dignità" in Italian, are in fact attributed in recognition of the highest office, of social rank, of respect for nobility, and so forth. Dignity here indicates socially recognized authority. The "dignitary" is the person who carries out an important role in a given society, as in the case of the ecclesiastical dignitary, the political dignitary. Dignity can also indicate the authority of an idea, a conception, and relative respect for that idea, for that conception general, fundamental, absolute principle, as in the case of an axiom. In all these acceptations of the word "dignity," we are dealing with the dignity of being, with the ontological dignity of the human being, as if dignity simply consisted in being something, as though it were a fact of "essence". This is a question of multiple different dignities, of the different aspects of dignity, its different masks, corresponding to the different identities of being.

The dignity of the law can derive from the intrinsec value of each one, from the respect that I owe the other as other: the dignity of the nude and helpless face in front of which, before all positive law, I perceive the commandment "you shall not kill".

Or, the law carries out the role of defending an office, a social, juridical position, an authority that is elected, nominated, inherited; the law defends the law itself; the law is law and must be respected as such; dignity is the law itself.

This double "position" of the law, this dual law-dignity relationship is a recurrent object of reflection in the writings of Emmanuel Levinas, throughout all his works.

As Levinas observes in "Liberté et commandement" ([1953)](#page-212-0), to guarantee freedom, to avoid the danger of tyranny, it will be necessary to institute a just State, to formulate just laws. But order established in such terms can backfire on the I itself, in the form of fixed and unflexible law, dura lex, it too tyrannical and violent. And above all, because it is based on the rights of the I, precisely, on the order of a just State with its just laws, the State with its laws can also command war, an "inevitable" means of defence, the realistic face of being and of inter-estedness, an unavoidable tribute to the conatus essendi of the individual and of the community an individual belongs to as an individual (see also Levinas [1966)](#page-213-0).

In the name of its very own freedom the I is open to blackmail by an impersonal order, to the point even of accepting without question the extrema ratio of war. Recourse to violence is sanctioned, considered necessary in order to suppress violence. The impersonal discourse of the law administers the being of things in realistic terms. And in such discourse, war presents itself as irresistable violence, ineluctible sacrifice of the I, sacrifice that cannot be avoided (cf. Petrilli and Ponzio [2016a)](#page-215-0).

Nonetheless, being has its otherwise in its very own foundation. And this foundation is still more realistic, indeed truly realistic. Allusion here is to the realism of the face to face situation, face to face with the other, with others. Levinas explains that this is a relationship of commandment without tyranny, which is not yet obedience to an impersonal law, but rather the indispensible condition for the institution of such a law. The I is constituted as responsibility beginning from the opposition of a nude face, the opposition of disarmed, defenceless eyes, which is not the opposition of a force, it is not a relationship of hostility.

The face, says Levinas in "Ethique et esprit" (1952, now in Difficile liberté, 1963), is inviolable, the eyes absolutely devoid of protection, the most naked, vulnerable part of the human body. Nonetheless, the eyes oppose an absolute resistance to possession by knowledge: "Knowledge reveals, names, and consequently classifies. Speech addresses itself to a face. Knowledge seizes hold of its object. It possesses it. Possession denies the independence of being, without destroying that being – it denies and maintains" (in Levinas [1963](#page-213-0), Eng. trans., p. 8).

### 3 Original Peace and Authority of the Face

Opposition of the face is a peaceful opposition. But here, peace is not at all suspension of war, violence withheld in order to perform violence at the best, for the sake of performing it to perfection (cf. Ponzio [2009a,](#page-216-0) [2012a)](#page-216-0). On the contrary, violence before the face of the other consists in the very elimination of this opposition, in circumventing it, bypassing it, in ignoring the face, and avoiding the gaze; and, as a consequence, in the possibility of finding the right argument through which no inscribed on the the face of the other insofar as it has sense in itself, independently of the I, can be interpreted as an adverse force, and consequently as an opposition to vanquish and overcome, to subdue.

Violence consists in conquering the other, in overwhelming the other, even through the law, the violence of knowledge that claims to name, classify, possess the other, in spite of opposition to violence; opposition expressed in the commandment, inscribed in the dignity of the face even before its explicitation in the formula, "You shall not kill," which asserts the demand of respecting, and not violating, the dignity of the human person, dignity of the individual in its absolute alterity as a single unique individual, as a singularity. According to Levinas, to find oneself in front of a face, not only directly, but also in indirect terms—for Levinas we are in a face to face relationship with the other not only in that other's presence, but also in front of any of the other's manifestations, whether a piece of writing, a handcrafted work, an artwork, the other's household, dwelling—is already to feel responsibility for the other, to peceive not only the command "you shall not kill," but also respect for the other, the obligation to listen to the other, to welcome the other, being the essential basis of all forms of "social justice" (cf. Levinas [1982a,](#page-213-0) [b,](#page-213-0) [1984a)](#page-213-0).

On considering the relationship between I, other and justice we inevitably incur in ambivalences, contradictions and paradoxes and to keep account of this is to somehow acknowledge the ambiguities and contradictions that inhere in life, in relationships among others with each other, in sociality. Levinas renders all this superbly with his original hyperbolic style of writing, intensely evocative, poetic, and thus capable of pushing philosophical reflection to the edges. All these complexities are constantly held into account by Levinas and inevitably condition his reflections on the relationship between I, other and justice.

In Levinas's description, the face is the place of exposition to the other, as such it presents itself in its nakedness, disarmed, defenceless, with no security, no guarantees; thus from under the face's masks there also transpires its vulnerability, weakeness, mortality. Nonetheless the face is also the place of authority, of command, the face with its exposition, vulnerability, impotence is at once authority that commands "you will not kill"; thus the face is the place of contradiction between fragility and authority. The I never gets free of the other and in this inability to escape the other, to discharge responsibility, in this constriction to the other, there is the infinite, the dignity of the elusive alterity of the other, therefore a concrete, infinite responsibility: "a responsibility prior to deliberation, to which I am exposed, dedicated, before being dedicated to myself", as Levinas (1995[[1985b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. p. 105) says in "Violence du visage" (an interview of 1985 with Levinas, by Angelo Bianchi, originally published in the journal Hermeneutica, now in Alterité et transcendence, 1995. The latter is a collection of twelve papers chosen by Levinas, originally published between 1967 and 1989, and the last volume published before his death in [1995)](#page-214-0).

Responsibility for the other even becomes responsibility for the other's faults, to be guilty for the other, to the point of taking the blame for the other, of paying in the other's place, of becoming the other's "hostage": "That way of being for the other, i.e., of being responsible for the other, is something dreadful, because it means that if the other does something I am the one who is responsible. The hostage is the one who is found responsible for what he has not done" (Ibid.). This situation is based on a responsibility that precedes distributive justice, responsibility in front of the justice that distributes, the justice that measures, the measures of justice, Measure for Measure, as recites Shakespeare—but the true measure of justice is not the dura lex of equal balance, the measure of balances, a truth which allowed Portia in another of Shakespeare's plays, The Merchant of Venice to save Antonio's life against Shylock's appeal to impartial law. According to Levinas, the very feeling of having done nothing for the other renders us hostage: responsibility of one who is not guilty, of the innocent—another paradox. Even the perfectibility of the law, the possibility of improving the administration of justice, is inscribed in my unconditional obligation toward the other.

In the bad conscience of European humanity, says Levinas in "Thou Shalt Not Kill", a section of his 1991 book, Entre nous. Essai sur le penser-à-l'autre (Eng. trans., pp. 192–193), there is anxiety for the suffering inflicted upon others by the "logic of things," by the demand of coherence with reality, by the realistic "ideologic" of the world as-it-is (Petrilli [2004)](#page-214-0); there is concern, unrest for suffering inflicted merely in the perspective of a deserved conviction, of a just punishment; there is the anxiety of the responsibility shouldered by those individuals who have survived the violent death of the victims, as if each single individual, though presumed innocent, were called to answer for the misery one did not cause and for the murder one did not perform. In the face of the other, there is no shelter, and Levinas admonishes that not even the fear of each for himself, in his own mortality, not even defending oneself, can succeed in absorbing the scandal of indifference toward the suffering of the other (Ibid., p. 192). In the biblical imperative "you will not kill," turned to each one in the face of each other one, we feel all the weight, all the pervasiveness of responsibility, unlimited responsibility, as it falls upon each singularity, in one's absolute alterity, behind the relative responsibility of the single individual, that is, of the individuality, a question of limited responsibility, that is, formal, reciprocal responsibility associated with identities, which identities compose the genus, the generic class, in this particular case mankind, humankind:

It is as if, in the plurality of humans, the other man abruptly and paradoxically – against the logic of the genus – turned out to be the one who concerned me par excellence; as if I, one among others, found myself – precisely I or me – the one who, summoned, heard the imperative as an exclusive recipient, as if that imperative went toward me alone, toward me above all; as if, henceforth chosen and unique, I had to answer to the death and, consequently, the life, of the other. A privilege which the logic of the genus and of individuals seemed to have obliterated. "Thou shalt not kill" – what an extraordinary ambiguity of individuals and genus (Levinas [1991](#page-214-0), Eng. trans., p. 193)

### 4 When Respect of the Law Becomes Effacement of the Other

Situations can be given, and historically they have been given, in which respect for the law—above all when the law safeguards the I in front of the other, when it favours one's own rights—predominates over respect for the dignity of the other. In this case, to respect the law means to efface the other and thus trample on the other's dignity. "I was simply doing my job," "I did my duty," "I not only obeyed orders, I also obeyed the law," "I enforced what I was told was the right thing to do": these more or less are the declarations made by Adolf Eichmann during the trial against him which took place in Jerusalem. This is the type of declaration that leads Hannah Arendt to write Eichmann in Jerusalem. A Report on the Banality of Evil, [1963.](#page-211-0) Unconditional respect for the law can lead to the belief, as in Eichmann's case, that responsibility means to have a clean conscience in front of the law and what it commands (cf. Petrilli and Ponzio [2020](#page-215-0)).

Justice arises to avoid tyranny and thus guarantee freedom, to safeguard the life of each one in sociality, justice is social justice, a question of the impartial distribution of justice according to the law. Reflecting on the relationship between freedom, responsibility and dignity, Levinas in Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence avers that the "Good" reabsorbs "the violence of non-freedom", and thus he proceeds to interrogate the notion of "finite freedom" which he relates to the notion of "pure freedom" (Levinas [1974,](#page-213-0) Eng. trans., pp. 123–124). The idea of a responsibility prior to freedom, where freedom and alterity are associated in responsibility for another, for others, confers an irreducible sense to the very notion of "finite freedom," without damaging the dignity of freedom thus conceived, that is, in finitude. "Finite freedom" contains an element of "pure freedom," and consequently it poses the problem of limiting the freedom of the will, but without solving it.

In an essay of 1954, "The Ego and the Totality," Levinas had already signaled the complexity of the relationship between will and justice maintaining that injustice cannot be reduced to an offence of the will, attacked in its dignity (now in Levinas [1987b,](#page-214-0) Eng. trans., p. 39). The will can be maltreated, violated, bent and twisted, indeed because of its very essence the will is exposed to violence, but, at the same time, it escapes the very violence it attempts to dominate. And, in fact, already in his early writings, Levinas deals with the question of the need of evasion, "De l'évasion" is the title of an early essay by Levinas, of [1935.](#page-212-0) With the concept of "evasion", Levinas alludes to the need to exit the identity of being, of the I, to exit the identity of the identical, of the same (cf. Petrilli [2019b)](#page-215-0). He finds the possibility of evasion from being, from the sphere of the I and the obsession of confirming and barricading self in situations that the I cannot control, that inevitably escape the I: pleasure, given its unbounded nature (apart from his prose, Giacomo Leopardi had already evidenced this with his poetry); shame, as unmotivated unease, traceable in the individual not yet become adult, in the child, whom, when asked to pronounce its name refuses to respond, and mother, or whomever cares for the child, offers the justification "s/he's shy"; nausea (a concept formulated by Levinas well before publication of Sartre's Nausée), that is, the condition of not bearing each other, feeling nausea for what the individual does normally, for the places one inhabits, one's dwellings, even in front of one's very own identity (cf. Levinas [1976)](#page-213-0).

### 5 Freedom Ensuing from Responsibility for the Other to the Point of "Substitution"

Responsibility for the other is responsibility without conditions. And it is in this situation of responsibility that the I's freedom is determined. Freedom is conferred on the I by the other at the very moment that the other puts the I in the condition of having to answer to the other and for the other. It is in this having to answer that the I is rendered free. Levinas says "ordained" free. Finite freedom, to be able to do something or not, is not original freedom, but rather is positioned in an infinite responsibility in which the other is other not because s/he limits my freedom, but because, calling me to question, interrogating me with his/her presence, with the mere fact of existing, the other puts me in the condition of being free to respond to that other in one way or in another, even opposite to the first.

This obligation to answer to the other and for the other foresees the condition of "substitution", of my replacing the other in that form that can be characterized as the condition of hostage, as anticipated above, to the point of persecution, of sacrificing oneself for the other, in the other's place, of giving my life even for him (cf. Casper [2019](#page-212-0)). This is a new type of accusation, as claimed by Levinas during a conversation with Augusto Ponzio at his home in Paris (20th November 1988): "guiltiness without guilt, 'indebtedness' without debt. Obligation of responsibility that nobody else can replace, debt that nobody else can pay in place of the I, and thus, for the I, the materialization of one's own uniqeness as I" ("Responsibility, substitution, writing. Dialogue with Emmanuel Levinas", in Ponzio [2019](#page-216-0), p. 22, Eng. trans. my own; cf. Poirié [1987)](#page-215-0). Consequently, finite freedom is not simply an infinite freedom that operates within limited boundaries. Even more: in the impossibility of withdrawing from infinite, unlimited responsibility for one's neighbour, for the other, in one's unreplaceability, Levinas sees the election of the human, and not servitude, observing that religions detect the supreme dignity of the human in such election (Levinas [1974](#page-213-0), Eng. trans., pp. 124–125).

The first case of the I is not the nominative, but the accusative, in other words, the first case consists in being called to question, interrogated: interrogation that concerns one's very own being, one's own condition, one's own life situation. The original question, according to Levinas, is not that indicated by Martin Heidegger, "why is there being rather than nothing?," but rather the question addressed to the other by the I: "why can you be this and that and I can't be?," "why can you be under shelter, safe, fed to satisfaction, and I can't be?". In the situation of the "I" in the accusative, of the I called to question, the I must respond with no possibility of delegating. The I's responsibility, the I's response, is mandatory, inescapable. The I in this responsibility for the other is irreplaceable. Not only its freedom, but also its uniqueness, singularity, irreplaceability, unrepeatability are thus constituted in the relation to the other, in responsibility for the other that cannot be declined, that cannot be refused (cf. Fanizza et al. [1998](#page-212-0)).

### 6 Language, Subjectivity, Justice

The problem of subjectivity, developed in terms of the relationship between alterity and identity, involves the problem of language. The origin of language, that is to say, language as conceptualization, as classification, as the capacity to extract that which is common from difference, and consequently language as the possibility of nominating and distinguishing in different ways, according to the different languages, is only possible in the relationship with the other. According to Levinas, language too arises from having to respond to the other, to an appeal made by the other, to the other's request of help, of acceptance, of shelter. Therefore, even before consisting in having to say something, language, as Levinas rightly remarks, consists in having to give something to the other, in having to do something for other. Language too is founded on the I's unlimited responsibility, before and beyond being, before and beyond the identical, the same. Language presupposes encounter with the other, as its condition of possibility. This is not only the other, my neighbour, the other in proximity, nor is it only the first comer, but still others, those who may present themselves at a later time, that can arrive subsequently, that the I may encounter in the course of life, obligated to respond to them as well (cf. Levinas [1947,](#page-212-0) [1954)](#page-213-0). There is always another and another still in the open network of sociality. Therefore, language too is implicated with justice, that is with justice before the law.

The problem of language is studied by Levinas in relation to reason and knowledge, which is a relation he interrogates (Levinas, "Philosophy and Transcendence", in [1995](#page-214-0)[1989], Eng. trans., pp. 3–38): is reason at the foundation of language or does language precede thematization, knowledge, the concept, with respect to which it is constitutive? What does Levinas understand by language?, and why even pose the problem? This is the philosophical question of the relationship between the particular and the universal. With Roland Barthes [(1980,](#page-212-0) [1984)](#page-212-0) we could say that this is the problem of the relationship between mathesis singularis and mathesis universalis, in other words, between the identity of the universal and the alterity of the particular, the singular.

To the extent that it is capable of expressing always more than what the signifier says, language is significance, alterity and excess that cannot be absorbed by meaning, by the theme, by the identical. In Levinas's terminology language as what he denominates "saying" trascends the boundaries of the "said," of meaning, of the concept, and presents itself as "writing," écriture avant la lettre, well before writing understood as "transcription," in the sense of these terms as described and related to each other by the same Barthes ([1953)](#page-212-0). Language in Levinas is the event before it is fixed in representation, the possibility of impossible involvement with the other, the other whom as other evades possession, mastery by the I (cf. Petrilli [1994,](#page-214-0) [1998,](#page-214-0) [2015d;](#page-215-0) Ponzio [2017)](#page-216-0). As the condition for unconditional participation in the situations of others, the essence of language is interpellation, appeal.

It ensues that the origin of language, which in Levinas is also the origin of signifying, is saying without the said, what he describes as "passivity of passivity," in which subjectivity signifies without reserve, "difference of one and the other" as "difference of one for the other," "non-indifference for the other", "dedication to others", what he also indicates as a sincerity " – and this sincerity is saying". In Dieu, la Mort et le Temps, of 1993 (a book that collects the course of lessons held by Levinas during the academic year 1975–1976, the last he taught at the Sorbonne), Levinas explains thus:

When the Saying has meaning only through the Said, the Saying is covered over and absorbed by the Said.

To the Saying without a Said an opening is necessary that does not cease to open, and that declares itself as such. The Saying is that declaration. (We must give the lie to everything that is constructed as an internal world, as interiority.) It is necessary that the Saying be a Saying of the Saying itself, a Saying that goes without thematization, but that exposes itself ever more. This is a Saying turning back on itself as though it were a matter of exposing the exposure, rather than standing there as in an act of exposing. To Say is thus to exhaust oneself in exposing oneself, to make a sign of that of which one makes a sign, without resting in its form of a sign. The sign would thus be a passivity of the obsessional extradition, where this extradition surrenders to the other, rather than being established in a position or in a substance.

There is, then, an iteration of the Saying, which is pre-reflective iteration and which designates the Saying as a Saying the Saying [Dire le Dire]. That is the utterance of the here I am, which identifies with nothing if not the voice that utters and surrenders. Here is where we ought to search for the origin of language. (Levinas [1993](#page-214-0), Eng. trans., pp. 191–192)

And, let us add on our part that, as a consequence of what Levinas himself claims, it is here that we must search for the origin of justice (cf. Levinas [1977a)](#page-213-0).

### 7 Language, Face and Ethics. The Finite and the Infinite

Levinas establishes a relationship between language and face: the face of others is language, that is to say the place of encounter with the other, by contrast with attachment to being, to identity, to the conatus essendi. The face to face encounter, encounter with the face of others, is already in itself appeal in front of the I to "disinter-estedness", to subjecting oneself to the other, to making oneself available, to surrender, and giving oneself. The face is image, but not in the sense of image resulting from vision. The face is image that is not revelation, that does not reveal itself, unveil itself, but rather re-veils itself. In the language of the semiotics of Charles Peirce we could claim that the face is an icon, that it self-presents itself according to the category of firstness, that is, for itself, kathautho', as Levinas says. This is the face as absolute and not relative alterity; alterity which in Peirce's language does not present itself as secondness, that is conditioned by the relationship to something else (as occurs for all identities, woman-man, father-son, communitarian-extracommunitarian), nor as thirdness, that is a sign that needs another sign to signify, another sign that interprets it (cf. Peirce [1923,](#page-214-0) [1931](#page-214-0)– [1958)](#page-214-0). Levinas says that the other is not a sign, but makes signs.

This is the reason why the relationship with the other is at the origin of language, it is not in language, but it is at the origin of language. In this sense the image of the face is not reducible to the status of object and as a consequence it is not reducible to the concept whose function is that of rendering the object intelligible, comprehensible and therefore appropriable, manipulable. With respect to the object and to the concept, with respect to reality which is made of objects and concepts, with respect to vision which sheds light and illuminates, the face as image is the double, the shadow as Levinas says in "La réalité et son ombre" ([1948)](#page-212-0).

In a note to his essay "Langage et proximité" (included in the 1967 edition of his 1949 book, En découvrant l'existence avec Husserl et Heidegger), Levinas explains the sense in which he understands the term "ethics", and precisely:

We call ethical a relationship between terms such as are united neither by a synthesis of the understanding nor by a relationship between subject and object, and yet where the one weighs or concerns or is meaningful to the other, where they are bound by a plot which knowledge can neither exhaust nor unravel (Levinas [1949](#page-212-0), 2a ed. [1967](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. 116, note).

In Levinas, ethics in the sense described above, which as such is at the origin of signification, ethics that precedes ontology (as he repeats in his essay of 1984, "Prayer without Demand"), concerns the relationship between language and body, in an intrigue where the relationship consists in the first place in contact, participation, and responsibility of the I for the other (cf. Ponzio [2008a,](#page-216-0) [2009b)](#page-216-0). The ethical intrigue involving together body and language gives rise to an assymetrical communication in which sense, from the I to the other, is not indifferent and is not reversible. Such intrigue is the space of the singularity of each one, of excess with respect to the official order, of significance that is not exhausted in signification, of saying that oversteps the said (see also "La Signification et le Sens," in Levinas [1972,](#page-213-0) pp. 17–63, in which he explains the ethical dimension of communication). The ethical intrigue says of the word as a unique, unrepeatable event, expression of irreducible alterity of the single individual, of one's unreplaceability, and therefore of infinity in unreversible responsibility of the I for the other, or as Levinas also says in Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence ([1974)](#page-213-0), of infinite meaning in responsibility. The ambivalence of infinity, or transcendence, which is always enigmatic alludes to what cannot be possessed, known, or assembled once for all, the trace of impossible incarnation in proximity with the other, where there emerges a responsibility that does not originate in me:

The fleeting trace effacing itself and reappearing is like a question mark put before the scintillation of the ambiguity: the infinite responsibility of the one for the other, or the signification of the Infinite in responsibility. There is an ambiguity of the order that orders to me the neighbour that obsesses me, for whom and before whom I answer by my ego, in which being is inverted into a substitution. In it I could not arise soon enough to be there on time, nor approach without the extraordinary distance to be crossed augmenting before every effort to assemble it into an itinerary. (Levinas [1974](#page-213-0), Eng. trans., pp. 161–162)

In the face of the single individual there is the infinite. In the face there is the uneliminable trace of the absolutely other, of uniqueness, on the respect of which depends the I's dignity, that is the dignity imposed upon me by the other's elusive alterity, in that other's mystery, alterity that evades the totalizing grasp of knowledge, possession by the I, framing in whatever identity. The trace of the infinite in the face of the other says of the invisible, of absence, a metaphor of signifying prior to thematization, the said, the object, knowledge, being, identity, representation, prior to the concept; the infinite of the face is transcendence given in the relationship with the other "man", the other human being, transcendence that does not become immanence, entrapped in the identity of being.

As Levinas says in an essay of 1968, "Infini", originally published in Encyclopaedia Universalis (now in Alterité et transcendence), we come to know the finite in the light of the infinite, the measure of that which is, of all things, is the infinite:

Infinity is the adequate measure of all that is: it is the finite straight line that is in potentiality and the infinite straight line in act, actualizing that which was only potential in the finite straight line. Henceforth, it is by the infinite that the finite is known – a thesis that is affirmed in Campanella (1568-1639), Descartes, Malebranche, Pascal, Spinoza and Leibniz. The indetermination of the world is the imitation of God's absolute infinity. The unlimited character of space acquires the dignity of a perfection, in counter-distinction from the Aristotelian order of values. Thus, outside rigorously scientific motives, it was a religious thought that determined the infinitism of modern science. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600) said to the inquisitors of Venice: "I teach the infinite universe, the effect of the infinite power of God". (Levinas 1995[[1968b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. 1999: 66)

Indeterminacy of the world reflects the absolute infinite, therefore in the indeterminacy characteristic of life, there is the trace of dignity conferred by infinity, irreducible alterity. Paradoxically, if we can somehow approach the finite this is through infinity, if the finite is knowable in some measure, this is possible on the background of the infinite, that is to say keeping account of the indeterminacy of the world, and as Levinas says, such indeterminacy is the imitation of the absolute infinite.

### 8 Justice and Signification. Law as Original Recognition of the Right of Others

In the assymetrical relationship between the I and the you there enters the third, another neighbour, another face, another unreachable, unknowable alterity, another incomparable, unique, single individual. This tells of the proximity of the multiplicity in which the I passes from the relationship of responsibility for the other, to the question who comes first?

This is where the problem of justice arises. Who is the other par excellence? How to judge? How to compare incomparables in a relationship between one unique single individual and another, among singularities? The person one is responsible for is unique, and the person responsible cannot delegate this responsibility, so that the person responsible is also unique, singular (cf. Ponzio [2016](#page-216-0)).

In his essay of 1986, "La proximité de l'autre", Levinas returns to reflect upon such issues that traverse all his writings, as in his book Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence (1974). The question of the third, as anticipated, is the question of the other, after the "first comer," also the "second comer", the third, so that the problem of social justice emerges with the multiplicity, with the need therefore to compare, know, judge:

The act of consciousness is motived by the presence of a third party alongside of the neighbour approached. A third party is also approached; and the relationship between the neighbour and the third party cannot be indifferent to me when I approach. There must be justice among incomparable ones. There must then be a comparison between incomparables and a synopsis, a togetherness and contemporaneousness. There must be thematization, thought, history and inscription. But being must be understood on the basis of being's other. (Levinas [1974](#page-213-0), tr. it.: 21-22)

"Peace, peace to the neighbour and the one far off" (Isaiah 57, 19). This line from Isaiah in the Sacred Scriptures, cited by Levinas, poses together the problem of the other and of the third party, both my neigbours. Not only is there the "first comer" to answer, to welcome, to respect, but the "second comer" too, and again the "third comer". The third too is my neighbour, and is also a neighbour of the other (autrui). The presence of the third gives birth to the problem of justice, to that of equity, fairness, and thus the demand of law. Justice is necessary, says Levinas, which means to say that comparison of incomparables is necessary, equality among incomparables, identification among singularities irreducible to systems:

Justice is necessary, that is, comparison, coexistence, contemporaneousness, assembling, order, thematization, the visibility of faces, and thus intentionality and the intellect, and in intentionality and the intellect, the intelligibility of a system, and thence also a copresence on an equal footing as before a court of justice. Essence as synchrony is togetherness in a place. Proximity takes on new meaning in the space of contiguity. But pure contiguity is not a "simple nature". It already presupposes both thematizing thought and a locus and the cutting up of the continuity of space into discrete terms and the whole – out of justice. (Levinas [1974](#page-213-0), Eng. trans., p. 157)

Commencing from justice the problem is how to reconcile the multiplicity, the many others, copresent, contiguous, in contemporaneity, on the basis of the law, before a court of justice; how to distribute justice in equal manner, how to live out unlimited responsibility, for all, on the basis of the law. Here, then, the demand to institute the State with its laws which are not meant to discriminate, in front of which "all are equal".

The unidirectional flow of Saying, of proximity, of responsibility is interrupted by the problem posed by Being, by the need for intelligibility of the system. Entry of the third is the very fact of consciousness, which implies accessibility to the abstraction of the concept, comparison of incomparables, thematization of the Same on the basis of the relationship with the other, beginning from the proximity and the immediacy of saying, prior to problems, "whereas the identification of knowing by itself absorbs every other" (Ibid., p. 158).

In spite of this, at the basis of law and as the ultimate finality of law there remains responsibility for the other, recognition of the other's alterity, which means to recognize the other's special condition, distinctive needs, unique requirements. And on this depends the dignity of the person who is called to answer to the other. Dignity alludes to the other as a value, the other to respect, appreciate, valorize, to take into consideration and to love. Genus, generic class and its identities take second place.

To understand being it is necessary to start from the other than being (autrement qu'être), from the signification of approach, of proximity; being is being with the other, with others, for or against a third party; with the other and the third party against oneself, in justice. Justice opposes philosophy that does not see beyond being, that reduces saying to the said, thereby abusing language, that reduces sense to interest. Instead, it is in disinterestedness, passivity or patience, when responsibility for the other is also responsibility for the third, that justice, the synchrony of being and peace take shape and establish themselves (cf. Petrilli [2017)](#page-215-0).

This situation leads to the need to transform an assymetrical relationship, among unequals, a relationship without reciprocity into a relationship of reciprocity and equality among the members of a given society, thereby placing limits on the unlimited responsibility associated with the primordial condition of the "for-theother". At the source of the quest for justice there is the for-the-other, to forget this involves the risk of transforming the sublime and difficult work of justice into a purely political calculation, which may even reach the level of totalitarian abuse (Levinas, "Violence du visage," 1995[[1985b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans.: 171).

s Justice and consciousness arise from signification. Being as being is a function of justice. Justice is signified by signification, hence by "the-one-for-the-other". A Levinas explains in Autrement qu'être, justice as such demands equivalence or simultaneity between "consciousness acceding to being and being open to consciousness" ([1974,](#page-213-0) Eng. trans., p. 163). According to Levinas: "Everything shows itself and is said in being for justice, and receives the structures of the thematized and the said – even signification and justice" (Ibid.). Sociality requires justice, it involves the need to compare singularities, incomparable others, to which necessity is associated consciousness and knowledge. Justice presupposes infinite responsibility for the other, non-indifference for the other, as its condition of possibility. Justice arises from love for the other, love without concupiscence, says Levinas, from love as charity, as listening, acceptance, the welcome, as dis-inter-ested love, at the service of the other, love at the service of love.

So then sociality implies justice and citizenship, and in the search for reciprocity, impartiality, comparison among incomparables, among singularities, in a situation where the other has no privilege over the I. Nonetheless, in this situation where justice limits initial responsibility the I remains in a relation of subordination to the other, because the arrival of the third poses the fundamental problem of human rights, which are always the other's rights. Levinas is in accord with Wladimir Jankélévitch when he claims that: "We don't have any right; it is always the other who has rights". The relation to the other is neither one of fusion, nor of empathy, nor of identification, the relation to the other is envisioned as alterity. Sociality for Levinas is the best of the human. Before all verbal expression, the alterity of the face, of the for-the-other, elects me and summons me, calling me to my inescapable responsibility ("The Proximity of the Other", Levinas 1995[[1986\]](#page-214-0), pp. 102–103). In the alterity of the face, the for-the-other commands the I. Therefore, it is a question of founding justice that offends the face on obligation towards that face:

Sociality is that alterity of the face, of the for-the-other that calls out to me, a voice that rises within me before all verbal expression, in the mortality of the I, from the depths of my weakness. That voice is an order. I have the order to answer for the life of the other person. I do not have the right to leave him alone to his death. (Ibid. pp. 103-104)

We have commented on Levinas's use of paradox and hyperbole as characterizing his argumentative procedure and somehow reflecting, even enhancing, the signifying ambivalence of the alterity relation in sociality. Levinas's description of the ambiguity of the face is another example: the face object of exposition to the other, expression of fragility, is also the place of authority, of command. The face, exposed to the possibility of violence, even murder, is together authority and commandment manifest in the expression "you will not kill". It follows that the face is the place of ambivalence between vulnerability and authority, weakness and resistance.

### 9 Justice and Responsibility. Ambivalences of the Face

When we enter the sphere of the inter-human the first question that concerns us as members of the same social organization is justice. As Levinas repeats in "Paix et proximité", originally published in Les Cahiers de la nuit surveillée, 1984 (now in Alterité et transcendence), because of the need to apply the principle of equality indiscriminantly, to each single individual in one's uniqueness, according to the order of justice, confrontation among incomparables is superimposed upon the relationship with the other, the incomparable. With respect to my relationship with the unique, this involves overlap of the neutrality (presence, representation) of being, thematization and visibility of the face, the weight of possessing and of exchanges, the need of thinking together the multiplicity and the unity of the world, under a single synthetic theme, promotion of the relation and of ultimate significance of being to intentional and intelligible thought, and finally the importance of the political structure of a society, of the system of essentially egalitarian laws, of institutions in which the I, the "for-the-other of subjectivity," enters with the dignity of the citizen (cf. J. Ponzio [1999](#page-216-0), [2004](#page-216-0), [2007](#page-216-0)).

Nonetheless notions like "being," "rational truth," "political unity," and relations established with such notions at the basis, are the source of conflict and violence to the extent that they are centred on identity and the defence of one's own rights. Here, then, is the need to underline that the very dignity of the law presupposes the entanglement, intrigue between the relationship among others, among singularities, therefore the "one for the other," on one side, and being, presence, representation, thematization of very being, that can always be reconducted to incomparability, to unrepeatability of the unique, to the infinite of the naked face, to its dignity insofar as it is absolutely other, my neighbour, on the other.

As Levinas reiterates in "Paix et proximité", we must remember that the origin, justification and the measure of human identities is peace and justice; justice legitimizes them ethically, that is, retains the sense of the properly hmuman as disinter-estedenss beneath the weight of being, which means that justice is not a natural and anonymous legality regulating human masses, from which techniques of social equilibrium are derived to harmonize antagonistic, blind forces through transitional cruelty and violence. Consciousness is based on justice so that while nothing escapes control of the responsibility of "the one for the other," legality puts limitations on responsibility and delimits the State, at once demanding watchfulness over the other. For the human person, as Levinas observes (1995[[1984b](#page-213-0)], Eng. trans., pp. 143–144), cannot be reduced to a case subsumed in a general rule, as instead the computer is capable of doing.

Does the just and egalitarian State, the democratic State, proceed from war of all against all, or from irreducible responsibility of one for the other, from the uniqueness of the face, in an ambivalence that calls for watchfulness over the other, for love and care for the other? (cf. Galli [2011)](#page-212-0). Precisely because consciousness arises in proximity of one for the other, as such it can become "dis-inter-estedness". That the foundation of consciousness is justice means that consciousness, the objectivity of thought and of knowledge are founded on justice, and not viceversa. The reasonable order of justice set up through knowledge is superimposed upon the "extravagant generosity of the for-the-other," as Levinas says. And here philosophy becomes "a measure brought to the infinite of the being-for-the-other of peace and proximity, and as it were a wisdom of love" (Levinas 1995[[1984b\]](#page-213-0), p. 144). It ensures that there is no justification whatsoever for the institution of war, much less in name of historical necessities, no clean coscience for war!

The human is return to the interiority of nonintentional consciousness, to bad conscience, to the possibility of fearing injustice more than death, of preferring to suffer injustice rather than inflict it, to evoke Gorgia by Plato, as Levinas claims in a text of 1989, "Philosophie et transcendance" (now in Levinas 1995[[1989a\]](#page-214-0), Eng. trans.: 29). A bad conscience derives from the face of the other man that in his mortality interrogates me: a question that does not expect a theoretical reply, an information, but that appeals to responsibility in a relationship of involvement, of ethical proximity in sociality and in love. This is the disinterested love of responsibility, in which the I and the other in their singularity are not reduced to the status of individuals in an abstract class, no more than anonymous points in the logical extension of a concept.

In the presentday world, the loss of the sense of responsibility, the basis of civil society, the loss of the sense of dialogical, caring implication in the life of others is evident on various fronts. A striking example is provided by the problem of migration and how it is mostly mishandled by governments worldwide. These in fact have proven largely incapable of finding the correct equilibrium between safeguarding the rights of their citizens and offering hospitality to migrants, unheedful of human responsibility toward a central, inalienable value as is the dignity of the human person as a singularity, the dignity of the other's face (cf. Petrilli and Ponzio [2019;](#page-215-0) Petrilli [2020a)](#page-215-0).

### 10 Body, Algorithm and Responsibility in the Digital World

À propos technological society that our use of the computer sums up and represents, Levinas makes it clear that responsibility for the other cannot be enclosed in a general rule, in an algorithm. Today in the digital era the need to take one's responsibilities, the need for accountability is felt ever less. This type of "development" doubtlessly finds an explanation, even if partial, in the way we experience time, which is no longer the time of the other (Levinas [1946)](#page-212-0), of listening to the other, but time transformed into "everything at once, immediately". The "digitized individual," citizen of "virtual reality" is interested above all in surviving in the present.

The urgency of contemporaneity, of the contingent replaces the dimension of alterity, of time for the other, of giving to the other; the urgency of the present annihilates the time of relationships and of actions that call for time experienced in such terms. Moreover, technological society emerges ever more as risk society, in which the human individual—continuously threatened by dangers inevitably presented by technological progress (exposed daily as we are to identity fraud, informatic viruses, PIN cloning, fishing, fake news, etc.)—is thrown into virtual war among identities.

In the social order of velocity, functionality, efficiency, productivity, competetiveness, now the order of technological society, the time of the human is abolished, time for the other, the time of listening. Digital communication is successful the more it sensationalizes life, reducing, even eliminating the spaces of intimacy, privacy, modesty. Digital communication is associated with a digital space where the individual offers itself as a spectacle for the curious, in global virtual spaces paradoxically become ever more isolated, as spectator eyes look, rummage, denude, vulgarize, popularize and disseminate, stripping bodies of their dignity in the alternating play of maintaining distances or invading the other's life to the extreme. In spite of the appearance of sociableness, digital relations dispense users from any effort involved in cultivating friendship, encouraging the tendency to individualism and its egotisms, including different forms of "popular elitism" manifest in aggressivity towards the weak, as in xenophobic or homophobic behaviour generally (cf. Eco [2018](#page-212-0)).

Together with the sacrifice of the time of alterity, of the human, which implies elimination of the values, feelings, behaviours that connote the properly human including the sense of responsibility and of dignity connected with the time of responsibility, the capacity for indignation at offending the dignity of the human person, as in the case of injustice inflicted upon the other–, ever less interesting appears the time of love, absence, waiting, expectation, mercy, the time of the body, care, dedication, desire, trust, encounter, of the non-functional, the time of patience, shame, modesty, seduction, tenderness (in spite of Barthes and his figures of amorous discourse!) (cf. Barthes [1977](#page-212-0), [1982](#page-212-0), [2007](#page-212-0)). From the point of view of the human, this is the time of the tyranny of monolingualism and of totalizing monologism, imposed according to the dominant values of global communication which, paradoxically, is total communication, but charaterized by the tendency to social and linguistic alienation (Rossi-Landi [1970](#page-216-0), [1978](#page-216-0)).

The society of globalized communication is pervaded by anaesthetized feeling, by the lack of inspiration by the other, of the sense of responsibility for the other (cf. Perniola [1991](#page-214-0), [2009](#page-214-0); Petrilli and Ponzio [2000](#page-215-0); Petrilli [2008b](#page-215-0), [2010](#page-215-0)). In the "state of necessity" to which we are constrained by "digital hyper-risk society," the individual, committed to avoiding the traps set up by the society he lives in, is ever less mindful of the "qualities" that orient his actions—the I is always less attentive, less thoughtful toward the other, he feels ever less responsible toward the other. Even the law recognizes and tollerates the widespread "insensibility" that characterizes today's world: the person who finds himself exposed to the danger of serious harm to himself or to others, therefore who finds himself in a "state of necessity," as recites the Italian penal code [art. 54], can act without taking responsibility for his actions. The citizen of digital society is relieved by law from his own responsibilities, in other words, he is becoming less responsible, that is, legally unresponsible (cf. Manicardi [2020)](#page-214-0).

### 11 Human Rights, the Problem of Freedom and Self Consciousness. From Need to Desire

In "Les droits de l'autre homme", 1989, first published in Les droits de l'homme en question, Levinas maintains that since the Renaissance the "rights of man" pertain to the human person independently from prior external authority as much as from the will to take one's own rights or deserving them. Human rights, also denominated natural rights, rest with the human person irrespective of physical, mental, personal and social differences. Human rights precede the law and the social and psychological conditions of their concrete formulation. These, instead, are influenced by the cultural, technical and economic state of a given society, as well as by the intellectual level of citizens. Nonetheless these conditions do not constitute the foundation of human rights, they are neither the origin of this "privilege" attaching a priori to the human person, nor its justification. At the same time, the tenor (teneur), the quality, the level of human rights is not arbitrary, but derives from the a priori which valorizes its "normative energy," that is, the right to free will, thus as independence from an absolute, as a "dignity" (Levinas 1995[\[1989b](#page-214-0)], Eng. trans., p. 146).

But the right to human rights, the right to free will is exercised in the concreteness of the human empirical order, as the right to being-there, to live, thus to satisfy the needs of livelihood, of sustenance, the right to work, the right to wellbeing, to health, the right to beauty, that renders life bearable, ultimately the right to life in the world under all its aspects, the right to interhuman relations, whether established directly or around things. From a pragmatic point of view, free will is exercised by the single individual in a social world that is already given, experienced, an already lived world, already regulated and codified, already intonated, accentuated by the life of others.

For Levinas to defend human rights does not simply mean to become conscious of one's own rights, but to establish and formulate the demands of freedom, therefore its concrete conditions in the effective reality of modern civilization—a freedom which in Western thought defines the infinite. Levinas believes that the infinite as spontaneity, which means to say as freedom, will dominate the Western conception of the infinite ("Infini," in Levinas 1995[[1968b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. p. 65).

If all have a right to free will the problem arises of how to safeguard each one's freedom with respect to the other's freedoms: how do all the members of a multiplicity coexist, each one unique and free, without violating the rights and the freedom of the other? "The war of each against all, based on the Rights of Man!," ironizes Levinas (1995[[1989b\]](#page-214-0), Eng. trans. p. 147). Following Kant on the need to respect the other as an end and not as a means, Levinas identifies the possibility of peace among freedoms, among freedoms of the many, in the notion of "good will," in "practical reason," the will to listen to and hear reason. Thanks to the propensity for the rational, hence the universal and the intelligible, freedom consists in freely imposing limitations on one's own free will, in consent to limiting one's own freedom so as not to limit the freedom of others. Just as one's uniqueness is given in the relation to the other, it is in the relation to the other that the I finds his freedom, his dignity.

But beyond Kant Levinas keeps account of the distinction between rationalism of the intellect and rationalism of reasonableness and maintains that the Kantian notion of "practical reason" does not fully account for free will, which means to say that free will is not contained by pratical reason without posing difficulties. Beyond respect for the universality of a maxim of action, there is goodness, hence such feelings as mercy or charity or love, which Levinas describes as attachment to the other in that other's alterity to the point of granting him priority over oneself. The rights of man arise as the rights of the other, they express the for-the-other of the social, the for-thestranger beyond identity and return to the same (Ibid., 149).

Not only is freedom of the I constituted starting from the relation to the other, but self-consciousness itself. The I emerges on the background of what in De l'existence à l'existant (1947) Levinas describes as the il y a. This text closely questions Heidegger's philosophy and the phenomenology of being in its indifference, as an impersonal, anonymous being, as il y a, as "there is", unclaimed by any being (cf. Ponzio [2019,](#page-216-0) p. 35; also, Ponzio [1995a,](#page-216-0) [1995b;](#page-216-0) and Petrilli et al. [2005)](#page-215-0).

Escape from this anonymous persistance of being, from essence, as Levinas was later to say in Autrement qu'être ou au-delà de l'essence (1974), in the sense of the accomplishment of being, of the process or event of being, of what he names essence, occurs in the relation to the other, as other (autrui). The other exits from presence, identity, from initiative taken by the I.

The I emerges from the background of the impersonal il y a and asserts itself in the encounter with the other, where the I reaches self consciousness which is also to exit from self. The first exiting from self, an eruption from being, starts from the recognition of things and is accompanied by the jouissance of life, which involves the singularity of each one. The relation to the other is the experience that gives rise to opening and true exit from self. Despite satisfaction, pleasure, jouissance, the subject discovers it is not sufficient to itself and thus opens to the other, opening that is at once appeal and response to the other. Interrogation of self originates in proximity to the other in the passage from a relation with things based on need to a relation based on recognition of the needs of others and on desire. "All exiting from self represents the fissure that opens up in the same toward the other. Desire metamorphosed into an attitude of openness to exteriority. Openness that is appeal and response to the other. The proximity of the other, origin of all putting into question of self" ("La proximité de 1'autre," in Levinas 1995[[1986\]](#page-214-0), p. 99).

Contrary to Martin Buber who establishes a relation of reciprocity between I and you, an immediately social relation among equals—I am for the other what the other is for me–, Levinas works on the hypothesis that the I-other relation is an assymetrical relation, one of profound inequality, a relation among unequals. When I expect my generosity toward the other to be reciprocated, this relation does not imply generosity but transforms into a commercial relation, an exchange relation, even if a question of good intentions, of good behaviour. Instead, in the relation to the other, the other is one to whom I owe something, toward whom I have an original responsibility, toward whom I have obligations. Levinas insists on the meaning of the gratuitousness of the "for-the-other," that presupposes unconditional responsibility: "The 'for the other' arises within the I, like a command heard by him, as if obedience were already being [l'être] listening for the dictate. Alterity's plot is born before knowledge" (Ibid.; cf. Ponzio [2012b)](#page-216-0).

### 12 Justice, Love, Saintliness

The human consists in opening oneself to the death of the other, in preoccupation with the other's death. Humanity is manifest around the death of my neighbour. In other words, in my response to the death of others is manifest the humanity of the human (where, like "humility," "human" derives from humus, from humid mother earth, and not from homo), my humanity (Levinas, "Le philosophe et la mort," 1995 [[1982c\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. p. 158).

Justice arises from thinking for-the-other, from responsibility that the other bears for the other, which gives justice its dignity. The human is capable of recognizing saintliness and forgetting itself. But the central point in Levinas's discourse here is not that the human being is a saint, or moves toward saintliness, but that saintliness, the human vocation for saintliness, that human depravation cannot eliminate, is recognized as a value, recognition which defines the human, as says Levinas in "Violence du visage" (1995[[1985b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. p. 171).

The human order calls for justice, but Levinas reconducts justice to charity prior to one-for-the-other, to our unlimited obligation toward the other, to the other's singularity. In this sense, at the foundation of the human is love, dis-inter-ested love for the other. Justice flows from otherness. Therefore, it is important that the institutions that exercise justice are overseen by the charity from which justice issues. At the origin of sociality is fear for the other, love, responsibility for the other, and not at all fear of the other as wanted instead by the ontological order, by being. For justice to be just it is fundamentally important to maintain the relation of continuity between the institutions of justice, thus politics, and the preeminence of the other. In other words, justice must not lose sight of the face, of the other, the other as a singularity and not merely as an anonymous individuality. Justice practiced as pure rationality threatens the human with totalitarianism, a risk that accompanies the determinism of the rational totality. Rational justice is compromised, as Levinas says, when the relation with the other is profaned. "And there, between purely rational justice and injustice, there is an appeal to the 'wisdom' of the I" (Ibid., p. 176).

The for-oneself is always suspect. Justice can be traced back to charity, to the for-the-other, and in this initial charity resides the human. Polemicizing with Heidegger, Levinas maintains that the human being is not only the being who understands what being means, but "the being who has already heard and understood the commandment of saintliness in the face of the other man" (Ibid., p. 80). Even in primal "altruistic instincts," there is the voice of God (Levinas [1968c,](#page-213-0) [1977b,](#page-213-0) [1978)](#page-213-0). Levinas in the Jewish tradition questions reducibility of this altruistic instinct, where God has already spoken, to a phenomenon of the anthropological order: "The anthropological meaning of instinct! In the daily Jewish liturgy, the first morning prayer says: 'Blessed art thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who giveth the cock knowledge to distinguish between day and night.' In the crowing of the cock, the first Revelation: the awakening to the light" (Ibid.).

Dignity of the wrong-doer who has repented for one's actions, who wants to expiate one's sins, is given in the wrong-doer's prayer to God, because that prayer is for God. In our suffering the other suffers with us. "I am with him in distress" (Psalm 91, p. 15), in human suffering it is God, the other, who suffers most. The I who suffers prays for the suffering of God who suffers for the sins of humanity and the painful expiation for sin, a "kenosis of God!". So prayer is for the other and not for oneself (Ibid., p. 182). The prayer of the "just" is the prayer that the I addresses to the other for-the-other, the prayer is the "for-the-other", a prayer preoccupied for the other, for the other's suffering for which the I too is guilty.

### 13 Levinas and Bakhtin for a Humanism of the Other

The sense of the distinction established by Levinas between "justice" and "political calculation", where justice is moved by the other, both as cause and end, and politics instead is reduced to a calculation, to representation, becomes even clearer in light of Bakhtin's distinction between "moral responsibility", that is, responsibility without alibis, without justifications, responsibility as answering to the other and for the other, each in one's own inalienable alterity, in one's own unreducible semiotic materiality, on the one hand, and "technical responsibility," which in Bakhtin's terminology is also "juridical responsibility," "legal responsibility," understood as limited responsibility, circumscribed and guaranteed by alibis, on the other (cf. Hand [1989;](#page-212-0) Levinas [1989c)](#page-214-0).

The problem of responsibility is centrally important in Bakhtin's thinking and is connected with his original interest in moral philosophy, which he describes as "first philosophy". He had already elaborated his vision of artistic discourse in relation to the problem of responsibility in his early text of 1919, "Art and responsibility". Subsequently, in his 1920–24 essay, only published as late as 1986 under the title K filosofii postupka (English translation, Towards a Philosophy of the Act, 1993; translated into Italian as Per una filosofia dell'atto responsabile, in Bachtin e il suo Circolo [2014](#page-211-0), pp. 33–168), he characterizes the problematic at the centre of his attention as "moral philosophy". For Bakhtin, the problem of responsibility cannot be reduced to responsibility circumscribed to the sphere of identity, whether the identity of the artist, author, character, even less so the identity of a literary genre, or of a language. Bakhtin is not concerned with identity. Whatever the question he is treating, whether of the ethical, aesthetical or linguistic order, Bakhtin's interest rests with alterity. Responsibility is of interest to Bakhtin as the human capacity to answer to the other and for the other without alibis (cf. Ponzio [1993](#page-216-0)). He works on the word to evidence the presence of the other in it, the presence of another word that renders it internally dialogical; the word is opening to the other, the place of dialogue and encounter with the other. The I's singularity is singularity of the word in relating to the word of others. The fundamental problem in philosophy is the problem of the other, and the problem of the other is the problem of word, of the word as voice, recognised as the demand of listening (cf. Bakhtin [2008](#page-212-0); Petrilli [2012b](#page-215-0)). Bakhtin and Levinas both admired Dostoevsky who knew how to listen to words, and listened to them as voices (cf. Petrilli [2012a](#page-215-0), [2015c](#page-215-0), [d](#page-215-0); Petrilli and Ponzio [2016b](#page-215-0), pp. 11–38; Petrilli [2007](#page-215-0)).

Already in these early writings Bakhtin took his distances fron Kantian and neo-Kantian philosophy to go beyond. He asserted the primacy of moral philosophy over theoretical philosophy, and maintained that both theoretical reason and aesthetic reason are aspects of pratical reason (Bakhtin [1993,](#page-212-0) Eng. trans., pp. 3–5). Bakhtin accused formal ethics in Kant and in the neo-Kantians of theoreticism, that is, of abstraction from the I in its alterity, unrepeatable singularity, uniqueness determined in irreplaceability, non interchangeability in the relation to the other (Ibid., p. 41). Formal ethics in Kant and the neo-Kantian's does not succeed in getting free of the fault of "material ethics," that is, the conception of the universality of duty. The category of duty, rightly considered a category of consciousness if interpreted in terms of responsibility without alibis for the other, is however understood as a category of theoretical consciousness, as a universal category, therefore it is theoreticized. The imperative is conceived as universal, and consequently Kantian and neo-Kantian philosophy are not in a position to account for individual action.

In Kant and the neo-Kantians, as Bakhtin observes, the categorical imperative is subordinated to its capacity of being universal ("Act only according to that [maxim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_(philosophy)) whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law"); the action of the single individual is justified by its capacity to become a norm of general behaviour; the will creatively active in action creates a law to which it submits, thereby alienating itself in its product. The world of the practical reason of Kantian e neo-Kantian formal ethics is not the world of concrete responsible action, the world of moral responsibility without alibis (and in this sense distinct from "technical responsibility" and from juridical responsibility), but the world of its "theoretical transcription" (Ibid.).

Like Levinas Bakhtin too works at the construction of a humanism of alterity. Kantian practical reason, though considering the other as an end, is founded on the primacy of consciousness, of the Cartesian "I think," which favours its development in the direction of idealism (cf. Petrilli [2013,](#page-215-0) pp. xix–xxvii). Therefore, Kantian reason, in spite of itself, is the reason of identity, the reason of the humanism of identity. And this dimension of Kant's philosophy enters Martin Heidegger's thought system with his critique of humanism and of metaphysics, in the assertion of ontology as fundamental, and the impossibility of exiting the horizon of being, in thematization of ontological reason, as reason without transcendence, without the "otherwise," to evoke Levinas.

Levinas quite remarkably became aware of all this very early in his studies having witnessed the encounter between Ernst Cassirer and Martin Heidegger at Davos, Switzerland, in 1929, as a young scholar. Thanks to that encounter Levinas was immediately aware of the need for radical philosopical interrogation of sense for "man" in terms of the humanism of the other "man" (as recites the title of his book of 1972, Humanisme de l'autre homme). For Levinas that encounter sanctioned the end of a certain type of humanism, traditional humanism, the humanism of identity, opening definitively to a new humanism, that is, the humanism of alterity. And in the early 1920s Bakhtin too had already critiqued the limits of Kant's and neo-Kantian theoreticism, the limits of thematizing, objectivating consciousness.

Both Bakhtin and Levinas were aware of the central importance of the other in the construction of a new humanism capable of non-indifference in the face of the other, of dialogical participation and responsive understanding. Exiting the humanism of identity is achieved by recognizing the fundamental importance of non-indifference, which shifts the I from the relation to oneself and from being with which the I identifies toward a relation beyond identity, being and knowing, which is the relation of alterity as responsibility without alibis. The common thread that unites Levinas and Bakhtin beyond differences is the trajectory from difference, identity and from non-indifference (interest) of the individuality for all that on which depends its being, to the non-indifference of the singularity, of a uniqueness for another uniqueness, outside genre, genus, generic class with its guarantees and protections (cf. Petrilli [2015b](#page-215-0)). Here responsibility is unlimited responsibility, beyond any possibility of delegation, including to forms of circumscribed responsibility, guaranteed by alibis, such as technical, juridical responsibility, responsibility regulated by a profession of faith, an ethical code, in the name of some formal ethics, where the maxim of action is made to respond to the requisites of universality, as claimed by some abstractly human reason and as such vitiated by theoreticism (cf. Ponzio [2008b](#page-216-0)).

The I in its irreducible alterity, as a singularity, exceeds belonging, identity, and as such is without shelter, manifesting itself in its total exposition and vulnerability, irreplaceable in its responsibility for the other, absolute and non-delegable responsibility. The individual subject, instead, as individuality belongs to a generic class which renders it equal to the other members of the same class, interchangeable, replaceable in its limited responsibility circumscribed by role, social position, social contracts, legislative specifications, all of which confer the benefit of alibis. The constitution of the individual in the identity of some generic class (identity of role, profession, social position, political party, sex, nation, ethnic group, etc.) is achieved by sacrificing alterity, one's own, by sacrificing singularity, therefore one's irreplaceability and capacity for involvement without limitations in the relation to the other, in situations concerning others, in the life of others. And all this involves the possibility (or illusion) of attenuating what Levinas describes as obsession for the other, that is the obsession of one's responsibility without alibis for the other.

### 14 A View from Semiotics

From the point of view of "global semiotics" as described by Thomas A. Sebeok (cf. Sebeok [1986,](#page-216-0) [1991,](#page-216-0) [1994,](#page-216-0) [2001)](#page-216-0), which recognizes signs not only in the sphere of anthroposemiosis, but of life in general, establishing a relationship of interdependency and reciprocity between semiosis and life, the problem of dignity and of the relationship between dignity and subjectivity, dignity and justice is inextricably connected with the problem of the dignity of life in its globality, human and nonhuman. Human dignity takes shape in a greater context than that of specific situations and in a greater time than that of contemporaneity.

Respect, integrity, honorableness, value, elevation, social rang, authority, perhaps better authoritativeness, dignity is all these things and more, dignity is freedom, responsibility, love, loyalty, justice, charity, compassion, mercy, also obedience, humility, dignity is time, the time of lightness, of the infinite, and of engagement, of commitment, with Mikhail Bakhtin ([1970](#page-211-0)–1971, Bakhtin [1986](#page-211-0), pp. 132–158) the "great time," that is, the time of unlimited, infinite answerability, it is the dignity of a lifetime and also of very life in general, and it is also the dignity of death as the crowning of a whole lifetime.

Human dignity inevitably has to do with semiosis, connected as it is with corporeity, with need and its satisfaction, in that singular form that Levinas denominates jouissance and in which he has consist the exceptionality, the irreplaceability, the incomparability of each one; human dignity is connected with deferral of a sign to another sign, a transcendent movement in which is generated sense, significance, value, and also the singularity of each one (Rossi-landi [1990)](#page-216-0). Reading Bakhtin ([1981)](#page-211-0), we can claim that dignity is "sign materiality," in the sense that it arises from the essential, indispensabile condition of interrelatedness, intercorporeity, dialogism, therefore from the relationship with the other that such a condition involves (on sign materiality, cf. Petrilli [2008a](#page-215-0), [2020b](#page-215-0)).

Dignity derives from the other, from others. And insofar as it is sign material, the relation with the other develops in the entanglement, the intrigue between dependency and autonomy, between community and singularity, continuity and fracture, interruption, between presence and absence, visible and invisible, imaginable and unimaginable, between the rule, the law, the code and excess with respect to these. Sign materiality, semiotic materiality is also constituted in the intrigue between indicality, symbolicity and iconicity of the sign according to Charles Peirce's typology (1931–1958), which establishes that all signs are always "degenerate" in the sense that each type is always interrelated with the other, differs from the others, but defers to the others in that double sense of deferring that Derrida ([1967)](#page-212-0) renders with the term "différance". The term "intrigue," as employed by Levinas, already underlines that it is in such dynamics, complementary and contradictory, that semiotic materiality is constituted, and that such elements and such movements are interdependent, refer to each other, in the global interweaving of life (cf. Levinas [2002](#page-214-0), [2020](#page-214-0)). The relation with the other presents itself and develops in the alterity of semiosis, in exposition to the other, even possibly having to take the other's place, of having to assume the condition of "hostage" (cf. Derrida [1996](#page-212-0)).

Another semiotician who contributes to showing how identity loses any possibility of attributing dignity to itself the very moment it becomes "closed identity" is Charles Morris, author of The Open Self, a book of [1948.](#page-214-0) In Morris's understanding, "closed identity" involves the self-exaltation of identity, its self-entrenchment, closure, whether a matter of individual identity, of the identity of a community, or of an entire nation, and so forth according to a progression of ever larger entites. This book by Morris, written at the beginning of the so-called "cold war", is a strong and well argued critique of US politics where the question, yet again, is the question of dignity. In this case too the whole argument shows, with the instruments of semiotics, how the sign itself—as we have observed, without the sign there is no life—is always a response to another sign; it always occurs in the open-ended chain of "unlimited semiosis", as Peirce would say, and requires, in turn, a response that motivates and activates it. All this entails that the sign is always tridimensional: to the syntactical and semantic dimensions is necessarily associated the pragmatic dimension (see also Morris [1938](#page-214-0)): the sign arises from another sign, responds to it and attends a response from it. Closure of the I turned in upon its own identity, in the exaltation of one's own identity – to which, starting from the very title of this book of 1948, Morris juxtapposes the "open self "—proves to be a choice, a standpoint no less than delusory, destined to failure, and this because of the structure itself of semiosis, of all semioses, human and nonhuman, which is relation, response, opening.

### 15 The Relation to the Other and Semioethics

We have referred above, in § 7, to the concept of "ethics," in the sense used by Levinas, that is, as inevitable involvement of the I with the other. This situation is confirmed by semiotics as practiced by Peirce to Sebeok through Morris, authors we have referred to, as well as by that particular approach to the study of signs that goes under the name of Significs, inaugurated by Victoria Welby, known in the past for her important correspondence with Peirce (cf. Hardwick [1977)](#page-212-0), and today recognized for her important contribution to the study of meaning and language (cf. Petrilli [2009](#page-215-0), [2015a;](#page-215-0) Welby [1983](#page-216-0)). From the encounter in our studies among these authors and their contributions developed from different disciplinary perspectives (philosophy, semiotics, significs), we have proposed the term "semioethics" to indicate the perspective angle through which semiotics can contribute to addressing topics like the juridical, of direct interest to us here (cf. Petrilli and Ponzio [2003,](#page-215-0) [2010;](#page-215-0) Petrilli [2010,](#page-215-0) [2014)](#page-215-0). Noteworthy is the contribution, as results from our disourse so far, that can come to semioethics from the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas.

Semioethics is necessarily oriented in a philosophical sense, as indicated by its very denomination. But worth pointing out is that semiotics too, as the general science of signs, cannot avoid a philosophical orientation. The reason for this inevitable encounter between general semiotics and philosophy is explained by Umberto Eco in his "Introduzione" to the Italian edition of Semiotics and Philosophy of Language (1984). As Eco writes (Ibid., p. xii, my own Eng. trans.):

I believe that a general semiotics is philosophical in nature, because it does not study a particular system but poses the general categories in light of which those different systems can be compared. And for a general semiotics philosophical discourse is neither advisable nor urgent: it is simply constitutive.

Levinas clarifies that by "first philosophy" he intends philosophy of dialogue, therefore philosophy that cannot but be ethics (cf. Abbagnano [2006)](#page-211-0). Ethics for Levinas implies dialogical encounter with the other, it manifests itself in alterity, in the primordial "for-the-other": "even the philosophy that questions the meaning of being does so on the basis of the encounter with the other", as says Levinas in "La proximité de 1'autre" (1995[[1986\]](#page-214-0), Eng. trans. p. 98). The origin of meaning, of intelligibility, of rationality is in the face of the other, in responsibility for the other man, so that ontology, objective knowledge, politics have meaning thus conceived at their foundation (cf. Diamantides [2007)](#page-212-0). They are "commanded" by meaning as responsibility for the other, by unrest for the other prior to representation of the other in the social, in the community.

The plurality of human beings with whom we are necessarily implicated makes justice necessary and with justice the objectivity of knowledge, fairness, the impartiality of judgement; the multitude involves the need to set up law courts and political institutions and, paradoxically, even a certain violence, in fact implied in all justice: to defend the other, my neighbour, as Levinas observes in "Violence du visage," always involves a certain violence for someone (1995[[1985b\]](#page-213-0), Eng. trans. p. 172).

That ethics is "first philosophy" means that ethics, as described above, comes before ontology. Levinas repeats this: reason, knowledge, ontological thought are founded on ethics and must be nurtured by ethics, inspired by ethics. At the basis of all forms of humanism in sociality there is the for-the-other, attention for the other, thinking for the other, preoccupation, unrest for the other. This is the original condition described by Levinas in his book [1972,](#page-213-0) Humanisme de l'autre homme. The condition of good and evil, of their possible existence is the other. There can be neither goodness nor evil, neither cruelty nor justice nor injustice without reference to the other. Both good and evil as characterizations of human doing presuppose alterity, addressing the other, they depend on the existence of others. In semiotic, rather biosemiotic terms, alterity is what moves the advancing of semiosis and therefore of life, the orientation of communication and, in the specifically human world, the intentionality of the non-verbal behaviour and of the word in "good" and in "evil". All encounter, says Levinas in "La proximité de 1'autre," begins with a benediction, contained in the word "hello," which is already presupposed by all cogito, all reflection. Addressed to the other man this greeting is an invocation: "I therefore insist on the primacy of the well-intentioned relation toward the other. Even when there may be ill will on the other's part, the attention, the receiving of the other, like his recognition, mark the priority of good in relation to evil" (Levinas 1995[[1986](#page-214-0)], Eng. trans., p. 98).

### 16 Closing Considerations

All the values of the I and thus all its rights are for the other. "For the other," because of the other, is understood in a double sense, both as a complement of cause, and a complement of end.

Freedom itself, maximum recognition of the I and its maximum right, derives from the other, from others. Just as the I's very identity derives from others. The identity of each one is decided a priori with respect to the I—and we could even claim before one's birth. This is so for paternity, for one's name, citizenship, social status: all this depends upon others. Decisions are made concerning the I in one's absence, as occurs in court when someone is condemned in absentia, by default. Others have informed me of who I am. The beginning of my life is recounted by others. In the same way, others will recount my death, but this time not to me. Even freedom comes from others. It is the other who confers upon me this value and this right.

It is in the face of the other who interrogates me and demands something of me, not only verbally but with one's mere presence, that I must respond. And this response can be positive or negative, it can be acceptance or refusal: I am free. And therefore it is the other who gives me "this faculty". My freedom comes from others. I can even decide in front of things, I can decide to take or leave them, keep or destroy them, bring them into my space or expel them.

But if we can speak of freedom here as well, this freedom is still connected with the other, it continues to be conditioned by the relation to the other. We could say that when a question of the other, it is not possible to look the other way, to walk away, to play it cool as though nothing has happened.

To return to the problem of dignity, doubtlessly it is connected with my identity. The entire span of a lifetime can be devoted to obtaining recognition for the dignity of a role, a social position, a profession, an office. This commitment, this effort concerns the conquest of an attitude that the other must have toward me, and precisely toward my identity, affiliation, position in a community. And all this is generally also regulated by the law, and concerns my rights.

And yet, as we have attempted to evidence through various trajectories in our discourse, there is another dignity that concerns me, another dignity of my own, that concerns me, this time not as an identity, an individuality, but as a singularity, not as this or that, as beloning or not belonging, but in so far as it's me, apart from all qualifications, from all my identities.

<span id="page-211-0"></span>This other dignity concerns my singularity and implicates my responsibility for the other, responsability I shoulder, independently from my identity. This is my responsibility for the other, without conditions, without justifications, without alibis, without loopholes. This is my responsibility independently from what the law commands, independently from what the law prescribes or does not prescribe, and also independently from the limits that the law foresees concerning the responsibility of each one.

This then is responsibility that involves my dignity as a singularity, a responsibility independent of the law, outside the law, a responsibility that can end up demanding that I even take a stand against the law—examples are not difficult to trace, whether in past history or in conditions and situations of the present.

All this tells us that this other form of dignity and responsibility that concerns me and is the condition for dignity, is prior to law and at once the reason of law. The law, legislation arise to regulate my original responsibility, which is responsibility for the other on which depends my identity as a singularity—not as an individuality, not as belonging, not as the member of a generic class, a collective of some kind.

We have used the expression "reason of law". This reason cannot be absolute, nor can obedience to the law be absolute. The reason of law is measured, evaluated, verified, founded on its respect for my dignity as a singularity, which consists in my absolute responsibility for the other, given in my election as the only one responsible.

This also says that laws and rights are objectionable, adjustable, perfectible (cf. Cheng and Petrilli [2016](#page-212-0); Petrilli [2016)](#page-215-0); and this says that before being obliged to respond to the law as an identity, I must answer for the other in my singularity, for the other, my neighbour, in that other's irreducible alterity.
