# The Foundations of Human Rights, Dignity or Autonomy?

Manuel Atienza

Abstract What I defend here is the thesis that these two values—dignity and autonomy—, together with a third, that of equality, form a unit; as a consequence, the foundation of rights should be found in a certain combination of all three, which constitutes a complex unit presided over, in a sense, by the idea of dignity. All of this leads me to consider, on the one hand, the Kantian and Dworkinian thesis of the unity of value, and, on the other, what seems to be its negation: the axiological pluralism exemplified in several writings by Isaiah Berlin. In my opinion, the differences between these two thesis are significantly smaller than one may initially think: Berlin's pluralism does not mean moral relativism and his conflictualist vision of society could contribute to the avoiding of an excessive moralization of law frequently observed among certain defenders of legal postpositivism.

### 1 An Example of False Opposition

The question of whether the ultimate foundation of human rights lies in human dignity or, conversely, in autonomy, in freedom, could be said to have a dual dimension, that is, it is both theoretical and practical.

Thus, from a theoretical perspective, it would appear that there are conceptions of ethics based on the first of those values, that is, Kantism or Catholic morality are the examples that tend to be given; hence, from that influence comes the reference to human dignity as the foundation of rights that can be found in almost all contemporary Declarations. Whereas others, the ethics inspired by liberalism, would place emphasis on the second of these values, which explains to some extent the recent crusade of "liberals" such as Macklin or Pinker against a notion of dignity, that according to them makes no sense, in that it is either of no use, (because it can be advantageously replaced by autonomy, by the value that is required to recognise the

freedom of persons to choose how they wish to live), or either (worse still), it would play more of an ideological role, operating as an instrument of deceit and confusion.

The practical dimension refers to the use made of arguments based on dignity and autonomy in relation to many of the issues which, latterly, have been prominent and come under the general umbrella of bioethics. Thus, those in favour of abortion (legalising it in certain cases) or euthanasia (allowing people to die to release them from tremendous suffering), would appear to base their views on the value of autonomy (the right of women or each individual to freely choose whether or not to have a child, or if an individual no longer wishes to live when life has become devoid of all value); whereas opponents would above all outline the sacred value dignity—of human life: life from the moment of conception, or life also when it is lived with tremendous suffering. And more recently, in respect of surrogate pregnancy, it would also seem that those who advocate legalising that practice would support the value of autonomy (of the prospective parents and the gestating mother), whereas enemies of the practice would instead emphasise the value of human dignity (of the pregnant mother and—at times they might add—the child), which is more important than what any others might decide (even accepting the assumption that the pregnant mother's decision is also an exercise of free will).

However, in order to realise that this conflict (both theoretical and in practice) is not quite as clearly defined as it might seem initially (hence use of the conditional verb), it is sufficient to recall a detail that many participants in the most recent of discussions mentioned—that of surrogate pregnancy—have highlighted. It is a question of fact, and certainly a surprising phenomenon, that the most radical feminists may well coincide on this issue with the doctrine of the Catholic church (not just in opposing this practice, but also in defending the fact that dignity should prevail over autonomy) which, as is well known, is not the case with abortion, where the women's right to choose would be considered the paramount argument (although not the only one) to justify their permissiveness (legal and in general, also—moral). And finally, another reason to doubt the pertinence of this contrast is that it aligns them in the same boat, if one could call it that, of conceptions of ethics which until relatively recently were considered anti–ethical, namely that of the Catholic church and Kant.

What I propose to defend here is that this is effectively a false opposition. More precisely, not only the fact that it is erroneous to present the values of dignity and autonomy as if they were opposing concepts, but that these two values, together with a third, namely equality, to some extent form a unit, and therefore human rights are based rather on a combination of those values. With this in mind, I propose to recall firstly, the Kantian thesis of the unity of value. Later I propose to refer to what would seem to be its negation, the plurality of values as has been defended by Isaiah Berlin in several widely disseminated works. I shall then go on to address a recent and influential vindicator of the thesis of unity of value: namely, Ronald Dworkin. And I will end by indicating some conclusions that I consider pertinent to the theory of law in general, as well as to the problem of concept and foundation of human rights, and weighing up the balance between those rights.

### 2 The Unity of Value in Kant

I am not trying here to explain the synthetic mode of Kant's moral philosophy but rather confining myself to underlining a feature of it, which I believe, is not always taken into consideration (or at least it is not sufficiently highlighted), and which may contribute to avoiding what I have called a false opposition between the values of dignity and autonomy and, more generally, to raise in a more adequate manner the issue in question, which is that of the foundation and basis of human rights.

As is well known, the categorical imperative on which, according to Kant, moral law is based—at least when our analysis is circumscribed by the philosopher's writings in his Foundation of the Metaphysic of Morals (Kant [2002)](#page-56-0)—allows three formulas: that of universality— "Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" [p. 72]; that of the purposes or of human dignity—"Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of another, always at the same time as an end and never simply as a means." [p. 84]; and that of autonomy of will—"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law" that is, "act as if the maxims of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature" [p. 87]. Thus clearly, the categorical imperative contains the three great values of the rationalist ethic and of the Illustration: equality (universality), dignity and freedom. But Kant also highlights the fact that those three notions are interconnected to the point where to some degree, they become confused, or rather they merge into a single idea. And this unitary nature is demonstrated, at least, in these two forms.

On one hand, Kant uses some examples to illustrate how those formulas would work, that is, how would they adapt to the demands of the idea of a categorical imperative, and also therefore to the unicity of the ethic. Specifically, he takes four examples of duties, crossing a dual classification of these: duties for ourselves and for others; duties that are perfect and imperfect.1 These are respectively, the duty to stay alive (not to commit suicide) fulfil promises (not to make false promises), develop one's own abilities and contribute to the happiness of others. In relation to these, Kant shows in detail how the principle of universality and that of the purposes (that of dignity) lead to the same result: justifying those duties; and in relation to the imperative of autonomy of will, he does not carry out that exercise because, as he explains in a footnote, explains—he does not consider it necessary.2

<sup>1</sup> Kant considers imperfect duties (as opposed to perfect ones) those which allow diverse modes of fulfilment. For example, helping someone in need is imperfect, as I can fulfil this duty by helping a sick or hungry person etc. and choose which sick or hungry people I help. Whereas the duty to fulfil promises is perfect: I can choose which promises to honour. See "Duty" in Audi ([1999)](#page-56-0).

<sup>2</sup> "I can be exempted here from providing examples to elucidate this principle, since those that first elucidated the categorical imperative and its formula can all serve here for precisely that end" (Kant [2002](#page-56-0), p. 50).

And on the other hand, and this is something which—I believe—is not highlighted—or at least not sufficiently—, Kant emphasises that the three formulations are simply ways of representing the same moral law and that each one effectively contains the other two. I cite here a passage (from the Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals) at length, because I think it is key to my thesis.

The three ways mentioned of representing the principle of morality are, however, fundamentally only so many formulas of precisely the same law, one of which unites the other two in itself. Nonetheless, there is a variety among them, which is to be sure more subjectively than objectively practical, (85) namely that of bringing an idea of reason nearer to intuition (in accordance with a certain analogy) and, through this, nearer to feeling. All maxims have, namely, (1) a form, which consists in universality, and then the formula of the moral imperative is expressed thus: 'That the maxims must be chosen as if they are supposed to be valid as universal laws of nature'; (2) a matter, namely an end, and then the formula says: 'That the rational being, as an end in accordance with its nature, hence as an end in itself, must serve for every maxim as a limiting condition of all merely relative and arbitrary ends'; (3) a complete determination of all maxims through that formula, namely 'That all maxims ought to harmonize from one's own legislation into a possible realm of ends as a realm of nature'. A progression happens here, as through the categories of the unity of the form of the will (its universality), the plurality of the matter (the objects, i.e., the ends), and the allness or totality of the system of them. But one does better in moral judging always to proceed in accordance with the strict method and take as ground the universal formula of the categorical imperative: Act in accordance with that maxim which can at the same time make itself into a universal law. But if one wants at the same time to obtain access for the moral law, then it is very useful to take one and the same action through the three named concepts and thus, as far as may be done, to bring the action nearer to intuition (p. 94–96)

t So that it could be concluded from the foregoing that if the moral law contains those three values, it would appear that the foundation of human rights (which can only be a moral foundation) would also have to reside in those three values (or in a single one which in some way contains all three), and the determination of what those human or fundamental rights actually are (even though there is no reason to assume that they exhaust the ethic: in fact, this is not the case, as there are ethical requirements that cannot be transformed into rights) it would also require considering those three dimensions that is, it could not be that a human right, an ethical requirement—were justified in accordance with one of those formulations', if i contradicted one of the other two or both of them.

### 3 Isaiah Berlin: Axiological Pluralism and Moral Objetivism

As mentioned earlier, the antithesis of evaluative monism would appear to be evaluative pluralism. And whenever evaluative pluralism is mentioned, the name that immediately comes to mind is Isaiah Berlin.

In the (magnificent) entry that the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy dedicates to Berlin, the authors (Joshua Cherniss and Henry Hardy) underline the fact that from the early nineties of the past century that idea was the most widely discussed, appreciated and controversial of this great thinker's writings, and they also indicate that the articulation offered by evaluative pluralism contains many ambiguities and even some obscure areas. This is most probably due to the fact that Berlin never tried to formulate that concept in a systematic way, but rather he introduced it in the context of his writings on the history of ideas. However, regardless of this fact, it is certainly true that it is no easy task to define precisely of what this ethical position consists. In my opinion, it would be summarised in the defence of these five theses (without any claim that they are independent of each other), which I will firstly propose in a synthesised manner, and subsequently address in greater detail: (1) Superior values, for ultimate ends (and not means for other ends), on a cultural and individual plane are plural, they frequently come into conflict and cannot be reconciled in any kind of final synthesis. (2) Evaluative pluralism does not presuppose moral relativism. (3) Evaluative pluralism is a type of moral objectivism. (4) (Practical) reason plays a role in relation to the (resolution of) conflicts between values. (5) Although it is possible to aspire to a precarious balance, there cannot be a final solution for conflicts between values; evaluative pluralism presupposes acceptance of the inevitability of the decision and the need for those decisions to be sensible (conciliatory) and avoid moral perfectionism.

(1) In the text that is usually considered to be the "most eloquent and concentrated summary of pluralism", Pursuit of the ideal, 3 Isaiah Berlin presents us with the concept of evaluative pluralism as exceeding what is called "the platonic ideal," which he reached following a reading of authors such as Machiavelli, Vico and Herder. The Platonic ideal, according to Berlin, is that subscribed to by those who think:

At some point I realised that what all these views had in common was a Platonic ideal: in the first place that, as in the sciences, all genuine questions must have one true answer and one only, all the rest being necessarily errors; in the second place that there must be a dependable path towards the discovery of these truths; in the third place that the true answers, when found, must necessarily be compatible with one another and form a single whole (...), In the case of morals, we could then conceive what the perfect life must be, founded as it would be on a correct understanding of the rules that governed the universe (Berlin [2013,](#page-56-0) p. 25).

And in opposition to this, what Berlin finds in his reading of Machiavelli (leaving aside here Vico and Herder; but the conclusion reached is the same), is the recognition according to the Florentine author, of the compatibility between, on the one hand, the patriotic and citizens' virtues ("epitomes of manly, pagan virtues") required to be able to restore society to something resembling the Roman Republic to which he aspired and on the other, Christian values, (humility, acceptance of suffering etc.) which however, Machiavelli fails to condemn:

<sup>3</sup> The statement appears in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (p. 12). And that article includes the first chapter of the compilation curated by Henry Hardy entitled The crooked timber of humanity: Chapters in the history of ideas. It is a work written by Berlin in 1988 and which is published with a few alterations shortly after.

The idea that this planted in my mind was the realisation, which came as something of a shock, that not all the supreme values pursued by mankind now and in the past were necessarily compatible with one another. It undermined my earlier assumption, based on the philosophia perennis, that there could be no conflict between true ends, true answers to the central problems of life (pp. 26–27).

Machiavelli conveyed the idea of two incompatible outlooks; and here were societies the cultures of which were shaped by values, not means to ends but ultimate ends, ends in themselves, which differed, not in all respects – for they were all human – but in some profound, irreconcilable ways, not combinable in any final synthesis (pp. 28–29).

(2) Axiologic pluralism presupposes recognising that "There is a world of objective values. By this I mean those ends that men pursue for their own sakes, to which other things are means" (p. 30). These values define every way of life, every civilisation and although they may be incompatible that does not mean there cannot be moral intercommunication and that men "realise themselves fully" (p. 29). In contrast, relativism for Berlin is identified with emotivism and moral subjectivity and prevents that human communication and realisation:

I prefer coffee, you prefer champagne. We have different tastes. There is no more to be said.' That is relativism. But Herder's view, and Vico's, is not that: it is what I should describe as pluralism. – that is, the conception that there are many different ends that men may seek and still be fully rational, fully men, capable of understanding each other and sympathising and deriving light from each other, as we derive it from reading Plato or the novels of medieval Japan – worlds, outlooks, very remote from our own. Of course, if we did not have any values in common with these distant figures, each civilisation would be enclosed in its own impenetrable bubble, and we could not understand them at all (...) Intercommunication between cultures in time and space is possible only because what makes men human is common to them, and acts as a bridge between them. But our values are ours, and theirs are theirs. (p. 29–30).

(3) if Berlin's evaluative pluralism can be qualified as objectivist (it would not be a case of simple relativism) this is due, in my opinion (and here perhaps is where his approach appears to be most obscure or imprecise) to the fact that not all the ultimate ends proposed and pursued by a culture or an individual can be considered valid. Not everything is valid, but rather there are criteria that define limits. One of those criteria (of those limits) arises, as we have just seen, from the need for intercommunication. However for Berlin: "Ends, moral principles, are many. But not infinitely many: they must be within the human horizon." (p. 30). There are some values such as freedom which cannot be dispensed with: "without some modicum of which [freedom] there is no choice and therefore no possibility of remaining human as we understand the word" (p. 31). In the case of some principles, as formulated by Berlin, it would appear that they would need to be considered as inalienable; as in "The first public obligation is to avoid extremes of suffering." (p. 35); and therefore it is not possible to accept (his source of inspiration here is Alexander Herzen) sacrifice "of living human beings on the altars of abstractions –nation, Church, party, class, progress, the forces of history" (p. 34). And ultimately, there are in his opinion, "if not universal values, at any rate a minimum without which societies could scarcely survive." (p. 36); and as examples of this, which would presuppose violation of those minimum values, he cites slavery, ritual murder, the Nazi gas chambers "the torture of human beings for the sake of pleasure or profit or even political good" or "mindless killing" (p. 36).

(4) The fact that conflicts between values exist does not mean that in this regard reason cannot play a role in addressing them. Values (the ultimate ends) can be, and they frequently are, incompatible with each other but Berlin's position in this regard is far removed for example, from the irrationality of a Nietzsche. Thus, among other things, Berlin warns that "we must not dramatise the incompatibility of values": "there is a great deal of broad agreement among people in different societies over long stretches of time about what is right and wrong, good and evil". (p. 36); and as a result precisely the possibility of reaching agreements and making "mutual concessions" (p. 36). What Berlin rejects (and I believe this is particularly clear in his reply written jointly with Bernard Williams to a work by Crowder on pluralism and liberalism) is simply that conflicts between values can always be resolved by appealing to a rule (for example, the utilitarian rule or the lexicographic priority that Rawls gives in terms of freedom and equality,) that is, to some value that should always prevail over others. Values are incommensurable, in that there is no measurement of common comparison, such as that suggested by utilitarianism and which therefore has no algorithmic procedure for resolving conflicts. But it does not follow from this that the judgement made regarding a conflict between values in a particular context, would establish the priority of one value over another has to be considered "as non–rational or subjective or a matter of taste" (Berlin and Williams [1994,](#page-56-0) p. 2). And this leads to Berlin and Williams' comments regarding Crowder's approach:

In his talk of 'underdetermination by reason', Crowder seems unsure which of two quite different views about potentially conflicting values he is ascribing to the pluralist: that it is not a requirement of reason that there should be one value which in all cases prevails over the other; or that in each particular case, reason has nothing to say (i.e. there is nothing reasonable to be said) about which should prevail over the other. Pluralists – we pluralists, at any rate – see the first of these views as obviously true, and the second as obviously false (p. 3).

(5) In my view, there are several practical consequences of all the foregoing (the "normative" aspects of Berlin's thesis), although they are linked, and perhaps can be synthesised in the idea of political liberalism. A consequence is that what could be termed as the assumption of inevitability of the conflict and the need for choice (but choice with rational criteria): "The notion of the perfect whole, the ultimate solution, in which all good things coexist, seems to me to be not merely unattainable – that is a truism – but conceptually incoherent; I do not know what is meant by a harmony of this kind. Some among the Great Goods cannot live together. That is a conceptual truth. We are doomed to choose, and every choice may entail an irreparable loss" (Berlin [2013,](#page-56-0) p. 13). Another consequence (deriving largely from the foregoing) is given by what could be called prudentialism or a prudential attitude "the best that one can do is to try to promote some kind of equilibrium, necessarily unstable" (p. 47). And the third is the rejection of moral perfectionism. This last does not presuppose that Berlin is against any type of utopian thought (see p. 33), but we could call it a certain way of understanding utopias: "Utopias have their value – nothing so wonderfully expands the imaginative horizons of human potentialities – but as guides to conduct they can prove literally fatal. Heraclitus was right, things cannot stand still". (p. 33). Thus, what he rejects is political and moral perfectionism which goes against certain features of human nature: "the search for perfection does seem to me a recipe for bloodshed, no better even if it is demanded by the sincerest of idealists, the purest of heart. No more rigorous moralist than Immanuel Kant has ever lived, but even he said, in a moment of illumination, 'Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made.' To force people into the neat uniforms demanded by dogmatically believed–in schemes is almost always the road to inhumanity." (p. 37). Therefore, in what way is a conception such as Berlin's incompatible with the thesis of a unity of value? Of course, Berlin's vision of Ethics is not the same as that of Kant, yet nor would it be meaningful to present them as if they were totally incompatible with each other; that is as if one was the counterfigure of the other. Not by any means. The reference (obviously, in an approving tone) to the Kantian phrase reproduced above is not a rarity in Berlin's work; for example in Appendix to political ideas in the romantic age. The rise and influence in modern thought, Berlin considers that Kant did understand something ("he had a glimpse of this") to which he attaches considerable importance in relation to objectiveness and moral relativism: that the notion of objectivity in ethics cannot be the same as that used in the empirical sciences or in mathematics.4 The two notions of freedom famously distinguished by Berlin can easily be found in Kant's work although it is perhaps true that Kant never actually distinguished them clearly; in accordance with Bobbio, although the explicit definition that Kant gives of freedom is Rousseauesque, namely freedom as autonomy (that which appears in the third formulation of the categorical imperative), however, what he invokes and raises to the condition of the end of political coexistence would be freedom as a non–impediment, negative freedom (see Bobbio [1985](#page-56-0) p. 201). And finally, it would seem that both Kant's thought and that of Berlin unquestionably fall within the scope of political liberalism.

Furthermore, it is also obvious that between the two authors there are contrasting elements that are obvious at first sight. Thus, Kantian rigour the "fiat justitia et pereat mundus", would seem the antithesis of what was previously known as the "prudential attitude", of the need to make mutual concessions and achieve a precarious equilibrium between values in conflict; and Kant's wholesale rejection of any form of moral consequentiality would also seem to radically conflict with the open attitude that Berlin shows towards utilitarianism (although he does not accept it en masse) as is clear for example, when underlining the importance of the principle of avoiding extreme suffering.

<sup>4</sup> "Kant and some among the German Idealists had a glimpse of this in supposing normative statements to be not statements of fact at all, but orders, commands, 'imperatives', deriving neither from an artificial convention, like mathematics, nor from the observation of the world, like empirical statements. And if we follow this line of thought, it becomes clear that normative statements fail to be subjective not in the sense that they might have been objective, but in the sense that they are wholly different from the kind of statements (or beliefs or thoughts) to which the distinction between subjective and objective applies" (Berlin [2014,](#page-56-0) p. 329).

But it seems to me that many of those contractions are eliminated or considerably weakened when passing from individual ethics (which Kant seems to be thinking of when formulating his categorical imperative) to political ethics (which is above all what interests Berlin). And furthermore, it seems to me that the coincidences between the two authors are even greater if one considers the legal perspective in particular, that of fundamental rights. That is, I do not believe that the responses to questions that I now propose to formulate would have to differ greatly depending on whether they were addressed to a Kantian, or to someone who assumed a conception of evaluative pluralism like Berlin: (1) What is the foundation of human rights? (2) Which fundamental rights should be included in a constitution? and (3) How should the conflicts between these rights be resolved?

(1) Therefore, I do not see why being a party to evaluative pluralism has to be against considering (something which—as he says—in recent times is normal) that human dignity in the Kantian sense (the prohibition on instrumentalising a human being) is the foundation of rights as proclaimed in international declarations, or in our constitutions. Rather it seems to me that everything that Berlin writes on the need for intercommunication between cultures, for human realisation, for recognising certain "minimums" (some requirements that should be based on minimum shared values—which means universal–) may without great difficulty be interpreted in terms of human dignity. Both Kant's conception and that of Berlin fall within what could be called a humanist ethic, based on the principle that "the explanation and justification of good or evil of anything depends ultimately on its construction, actual or possible to human life and its quality". 5 The appellations that with more or less frequency Berlin's work makes to human nature (see Encyclopaedia) certainly recall Hart's doctrine of the "minimum content of natural law". And Lon Fuller held that maintenance of communication between mankind was the basic principle of natural substantive law.6 And as a result, perhaps, in short, it is hardly surprising that Berlin would qualify his position as objectivist and not relativist from a moral perspective.

(2) Nor is there any reason to think that some fundamental rights would have to be ruled out (as unjustified) in respect of evaluative pluralism, of the kind included in international declarations and in our constitutions and which—we reiterate—are understood to have their ultimate foundation in human dignity. This idea coexists,

<sup>5</sup> See Rosen [(2012](#page-56-0)), p. 130. Rosen takes the formulation of this principle from Raz.

<sup>6</sup> As is well known Hart and Berlin coincided for many years at Oxford and it may be assumed that they were familiar with each other's work. Regarding the American Fuller (Hart's rival in a famous polemic of half the twentieth century regarding natural law and legal positivism), it is worth recalling here some paragraphs of his work about the morality of Law: "I believe that if we were forced [he's commenting on Hart's famous chapter on "the Minimum Content of Natural Law"] to select the principle that supports and infuses all human aspiration we would find it in the objective of maintaining communication with our fellows" (Fuller 1964–[1969,](#page-56-0) p. 185). And a little later: "If I were asked, then, to discern one central indisputable principle of what may be called substantive natural law – Natural Law with capital letters – I would find it in the injunction: Open up, maintain, and preserve the integrity of the channels of communication by which men convey to one another what they perceive, feel and desire" (p. 186).

without apparently being rejected, with that which holds that in constitutions (or in any other texts containing human rights) there is not a unique supreme value to which all others are subordinate (there would be a plurality of ultimate values), and so it is commonly affirmed that nor is there any right that is absolute, that is, one that never has to give way to the preponderance of another right (or a set of rights). The existence of conflicts of rights (between fundamental rights or within a fundamental right itself) is something that hardly anyone would question (although a greater or lesser emphasis could be placed on the relevance of those conflicts), so that the dispute is more concerned with how to resolve those conflicts, and what role reason plays when a decision is needed in this respect.

(3) Recently, Bruno Celano, based on a conception of conflictualism of values that was to a considerable extent inspired by Berlin, (but also by Nietzsche and Weber), has defended the need to carry out some kind of weighting (when fundamental rights conflict with each other) based on a model which he calls "particularist" and which he believes contrasts with the "minimalist" or "irenist" models. The basic idea is that given that "rights, principles, values and interests that constitute the substantive ethical dimension of the constitutional Rule of Law are truly in conflict, they are truly antinomian, indeterminate, heterogeneous, often immeasurable" (Celano [2013](#page-56-0), p. 46), the weighting that occurs in a specific case in favour of one of the two rights (values, etc.) that are in conflict cannot give rise to a rule in the strict sense, that is, a conditional pronouncement universally quantified and which cannot be revised.

I believe that Celano is mistaken on this point basically because the rules can have exceptions (implicit exceptions: that is what revising or abolishing means) while still being rules (see Atienza [2019](#page-56-0)). But what I wish to highlight here is that Celano's particularism and his thesis that in law (in those difficult cases that require weighting) it cannot be said that there is only one correct response, is not, in my opinion, a necessary consequence of having assumed evaluative conflictualism, as Berlin does. That is, I do not consider that there is a contradiction in assuming the evaluative pluralism of the latter, which is more a concept than a conception of pluralism, as Berlin did not precisely define what his version of pluralism was) and considering at the same time that the weighting carried out by legal practitioners in those cases obeys a model of practical rationality (or reasonability), which clearly cannot be that of the rationality of formal or empirical sciences, but which could be governed by the idea of the correct response. I will return to this later.

### 4 Unity of Value and Human Dignity in Dworkin

In the last of Dworkin's books, Justice for Hedgehogs, Isaiah Berlin is very much present, beginning with the actual title of the book. But Dworkin had already addressed Berlin and his moral pluralism in another previous work, Justice in Robes.

What this last work does is summarise Berlin's thesis that values are plural, that they can conflict and that appealing to an ideal of a perfect whole, is not only false but dangerous. Dworkin recognises the interest and depth of Berlin's approach but disagrees with it, for several reasons. One of these is that he does not agree that the defence of the holistic ideal, (that which Dworkin defends and Berlin attacks) has the consequences that Berlin claims. Dworkin considers, effectively, that such danger exists, (as totalitarian systems such as Stalinism would have effectively subscribed to the thesis of axiological monism), but this is merely contingent. Moreover, the greatest danger of our era in terms of what it does to western societies would be on the opposite side: it is moral pluralism (they are the foxes not the hedgehogs [see below] that endangers any defence of the values of liberalism (to which both Berlin and Dworkin adhere). The depth of Berlin's approach would be based on the fact that the latter does not confine himself to defending cultural pluralism, and extracting from that axiological relativism, as so many authors have done in recent times. Berlin is a moral objectivist and he holds that it is not simply that values may clash for historical, contingent reasons: for example, if a nation has suffered an unjust class system—Dworkin concedes—it may be necessary to limit freedom for a while, abolishing private schools for a generation in order help restore equality. But it is not simply this that Berlin is stating, but rather that those clashes, for example, between freedom and equality are inevitable, they constitute tragic cases; so it is not a question that (in relation to one of those conflicts) we have doubts, uncertainties, as to how they will be resolved, we know that they cannot be resolved; that there is no possible response that would not lead to violation or damage to either one of the two values. And this where Dworkin's main criticism lies.

By highlighting the existence of that conflict, Berlin's approach entails a specific way of understanding, for example, the value of freedom: the capacity to do as one likes without interference from the rest. And this is what Dworkin questions, because for him freedom would be the ability to do what one wants, but always having respect for the moral rights, duly understood, of others (Dworkin [2006,](#page-56-0) p. 112). And if these issues are viewed from this second perspective, then it would be possible to reconcile (in the event of any conflict) the value of freedom and, that of equality, for example, or any other. What underlies this issue is the fact that freedom, equality etc. are what Dworkin calls "interpretative concepts" which will be addressed below. But in order to dispense with Dworkin's approach in that work, it is necessary to clarify that here he does not claim to have demolished evaluative pluralism with his previous arguments; that was to be the subject of his other book: Justice for Hedgehogs. What he believes he has proven is that in order to defend that position, it is also necessary to demonstrate that the way in which the value or the values that come into conflict have been understood is adequate (Dworkin [2006,](#page-56-0) p. 116). And this adequate conception of values is not one that can be found in dictionary definitions, nor does he depend on empirical discoveries; Dworkin recognises, by the way, the importance of an historical analysis of those concepts—interpretative concepts—but the history of political ideas cannot give us, shall we say, the most adequate concept of freedom. To achieve this we need to have recourse to a moral and political philosophy of a substantive nature (p. 113).

And now let us turn to Justice for Hedgehogs. As is known, Berlin (taking his metaphor from the ancient Greek poet, Archilochus) classified intellectuals as foxes and hedgehogs. Whereas the fox knows a lot of things, the hedgehog only knows one, but that one thing is very important. And for Dworkin, that big thing is unity of the value, the idea that ethical values (on how to live well) and morals (how we should treat others) are interdependent—they configure a complex unit; they support each other rather than coming into conflict. That thesis, in Dworkin's opinion, opposes the most extensively propounded perspective in philosophy in recent times (especially in the Anglo–Saxon world) which is inspired more by the way that the fox acts or which is equivalent, by moral pluralism which, as we have just seen, to affirming that there are many values (justified moral principles and ideals) and it is inevitable that they will clash.7

What Dworkin defends—it is appropriate to emphasise this—is not that conflicts between values (or between rights) can be resolved by rational procedures; but that such conflicts do not exist, that there are only apparent conflicts, but and that there are no such things as genuine conflicts of values (see Dworkin [2011](#page-56-0), p. 119). As a result, there could be no conflict between, by way of example, safety and freedom, or between freedom and equality and so on, and that the problem can only be resolved by sacrificing one (or an aspect of one) of those two values, as tends to be stated. And one of the examples that Dworkin provides to dispense with what in his opinion, would be an equivocal or, rather an error of approach, is Berlin's celebrated conflict between two notions of freedom, namely, negative freedom (such as non–interference) and positive freedom (as autonomy).

Berlin—Dworkin tells us—considers that both notions of freedom constitute ends in themselves, values, and they may well clash when, for example, in order to promote democracy (positive freedom requires some form of democracy and equality) some kind of limit needs to be placed on individual freedoms (on negative freedom). But Dworkin considers that this approach is erroneous. And Berlin's error would be in having failed to distinguish between two ideas or two aspects that come within the scope of what the author considers to be "negative freedom". For this reason, in the interests of clarity, Dworkin proposes that two different terms be used: "freedom" and "liberty". Although these words are often interchangeable in English, he proposes the following distinction: "Someone's total freedom is his power to act in what ever way he might wish, unimpeded by constraints or threats imposed by others or by a political community. His negative liberty is the area of his freedom that a political community cannot take away without injuring him in a special way: compromising his dignity by denying him equal concern or an essential feature of responsibility for his own life" (Dworkin [2011](#page-56-0), p. 366).

That is, freedom is a value, and therefore has a concomitant claim of justification; or in other words, if something (an action or a state of affairs) is qualified as valuable, then that means that someone cannot carry out a valuable action which, however, was lacking in justification. Freedom (like other values) belongs to the area that Dworkin calls "interpretative" concepts, which he places in contrast to "criterial"

<sup>7</sup> As representatives of that position, Dworkin cites in the first place Berlin, and then Thomas Nagel (Dworkin [2011,](#page-56-0) p. 425, note 2).

(or classificatory). Concepts. These last are characterised by a series of notes (which would be the connotation of the concept), so that when there are discrepancies in the use of a concept of this type, this would be due to the fact that in reality, they are not dealing with the same criteria, or in other words, that a concept is not shared. However, in relation to interpretative concepts, the disagreements would be due to causes other than those mentioned previously. Using a (same) interpretative concept presupposes that a practice is shared (not simply a set of defining criteria, as in the other case), and the correct use of the concept is concerned with whatever is the best interpretation of that practice; that means that the same concept can be shared freedom or equality—although there are considerable differences of opinion regarding when such cases are manifested, such as whether or not an action of an authority is an example of violation of freedom etc. (see p. 161). Our disagreements in relation to the use of those concepts, are concerned, in short, with the fact that we interpret the practices that we share differently (p. 6).

Thus freedom, according to Dworkin, does not presuppose any value (it is simply a question of the wishes that a specific person may have regarding the manner in which they want to act) and therefore it is not part of what should be understood by negative freedom or liberty. Naturally, there may be a clash between the wishes and preferences that an individual or set of individuals may have, but that could not be considered a conflict between values; nor, by the way, could it be considered such by Berlin, as we have seen earlier. So that if what we take into account is the value of negative freedom (if "negative freedom"—or more generally "freedom"—is considered as an interpretative concept), then this could not conflict with positive freedom, as those two notions of freedom constitute two aspects of the same value, responsibility which, in turn, is one of the components of human dignity: "Because responsibility has those two dimensions, so does liberty. A theory of positive liberty stipulates what it means for people to participate in the right way. It offers, that is, a conception of self – government. A theory of negative liberty describes which choices must be exempt from collective decisions if personal responsibility is to be preserved" (p. 365). Or in other words, establishing the duty not to kill and supporting it with a strong sanction does not mean—Dworkin tells us—any restriction on anyone's freedom, that is, does not jeopardise any value, because it does not affect the dignity of anyone but conversely, promotes human dignity. The (alleged) conflicts between values—we insist on this—should not be confused with conflicts between wishes or conflicts arising in terms of phenomena, reality; and thus, for example, Dworkin does not deny that in some cases is it necessary to impose limits on political freedom in order to prevent destruction of democracy: "But such constraints are as much injuries to democracy itself as they are to negative liberty: these are circumstances in which—allegedly—both democracy and negative liberty must be compromised immediately to protect both from graver loss later, not cases in which one of these virtues is preferred to another" (p. 366).

Dworkin's idea of unity of value, as he recognises, is very close to that of Kant and in fact they are both differentiated by the philosophical idealism of the latter; "Kant's unification of ethics and morality is obscure because it takes place in the dark: in what he called the noumenal world, whose content is inaccessible to us but which is the only realm where ontological freedom can be achieved" (p. 19).

In Dworkin's case what that unity provides is the value of human dignity which he indubitably characterises in Kantian terms and in a manner in line with the field of ethics and morality. In the first case (ethics for him refers to the individual plane, to what living well means), human dignity has two dimensions, which gives rise to two ethical principles, self–respect and authenticity. Those two principles, taken jointly, offer a conception of human dignity: "The first is a principle of self – respect. Each person must take his own life seriously: he must accept that it is a matter of importance that his life be a successful performance rather than a wasted opportunity. The second is a principle of authenticity. Each person has a special, personal responsibility for identifying what counts as success in his own life; he has a personal responsibility to create that life through a coherent narrative or style that he himself endorses" (pp. 203–204). In the field of morals (we refer—it should be recalled—to how we treat others) dignity, that is, self–respect and authenticity, extends to others, and gives rise to what we could call the principle of equal treatment (treating everybody in the same way), and autonomy (respecting the ethical responsibilities of every individual); for this purpose Dworkin uses the Kantian thesis that we cannot adequately respect our own humanity if we do not respect the humanity of others. Dworkin's two principles of justice thus express jointly the idea of dignity and constitute the two requirements that public authority must observe in order to be legitimate: "First, it must show equal concern for the fate of every person over whom it claims dominion. Second, it must respect fully the responsibility and right of each person to decide for himself how to make something valuable of his life" (p. 2). The unity of value would attain morality in general, which according to Dworkin, has a tree–like structure and also includes the law: "Law is a branch of political morality, which is itself a branch of a more general personal morality, which is in turn a branch of a yet more general theory of what it is to live well" (p. 5).

However the theory of Dworkin's unity of value is not the antithesis of Berlin's evaluative pluralism either. As has been mentioned several times, for him, values do not constitute wishes, but rather they possess an objective entity. Berlin's historical perspective when analysing moral concepts does not appear to be too distant from the Dworkinian notion of interpretative concepts either: it could be said that perhaps the latter are highly likely to be analysed historically, although history is a source of conceptual clarification, but—as we saw above—a parameter of justification cannot be provided, that is, it cannot permit it to be said when such use of those concepts is correct. However, there is also a coincidence between these two authors relating to what Dworkin considers "the most radical view I defend: the metaphysical independence of value" (p. 9), which is simply Hume's thesis (adequately interpreted) which was also decisively important for Berlin: which is that the objectivity of morals (moral values) is independent of the truth in formal sciences or in empirical sciences. There is unquestionably a significant difference between them: whereas for Berlin, values frequently come into conflict, without it being possible in those cases to obtain a "final synthesis", Dworkin defends that final synthesis in a very radical manner, that unity of value, because he denies, as we have seen, that is possible to speak of conflicts between values. But it is possible, however, that this difference is not in fact as profound as it might seem in principle, that is, it is possible that when resolving those conflicts (for one, apparent, for the other real) the positions are actually so very far apart. This will be explained below.

### 5 A Possible Synthesis

If, as I have suggested, the differences between Berlin and Dworkin (or Kant) are not so radical as it might seem in principle, this is due to the fact that they may all be considered as representatives of political liberalism and that Berlin—like the other two—is also a moral objectivist, although it is, as we have seen, a question of a somewhat special type of objectivism which, moreover, seems only to have been touched on in his work rather than properly developed.

Moral pluralism can be understood, in principle, as a conception according to which, both in individual and in social or cultural terms,—there is a plurality of values, of what are considered ultimate ends, which are not structured in such a way that they can all be considered as forms or manifestations of a single value. Obviously, the thesis is not particularly interesting if it is interpreted merely in a weak or descriptive sense: as a statement that effectively, there are individuals, societies or cultures that interpret what they consider to be their values in this way. As such, it is a statement that at least in many cases is unquestionably true. And as proof of this, we need only refer to the texts of our constitutions and the manner in which they are understood, in general, by those who need to apply them. In the case of the Spanish Constitution, for example, a number of "higher values" of the system are enunciated (in article 1 in which dignity happens to be notably absent), and it is a cliché that almost all legal practitioners accept today that those values (principles or rights) can conflict with each other, without there being any rule that allows such conflicts to be resolved. So what is interesting then, is when moral pluralism is considered as the stronger thesis, according to which, as there is no such thing as a single value, with a criterion for creating a hierarchy of all those values, possible conflicts could not be resolved in a fully satisfactory way, as opting for one of those values in conflict would to some extent entail damaging another (the one that clashed with it).

If understood in this second sense it could be held that there are still diverse conceptions of legal pluralism. One of those conceptions (perhaps the most current) is relativist pluralism, according to which, when those conflicts arise, it is not possible to rationally justify a decision in favour of one of the two values that clash; that is, reason cannot say anything or says very little regarding which of the two values should prevail, so that if one of them is not satisfied, it can only be seen as a sacrifice, a loss of value. Or, more precisely, perhaps moral relativists may well think that, given the nature of values, it is essential as far as is possible, through institutional means etc. to avoid conflict between them, and where this is impossible, endeavour to mitigate their negative effects. But those conflicts cannot be resolved (rationally), as there are no objective criteria (irrespective of what an individual or a group might think; that is, not relative) that can be applied to the situation.

Another possible conception of axiological pluralism consists of making it compatible with some type of more or less robust moral objectivism, that is, with the idea that not all values are equal, so that there are some objective criteria (regardless of the ultimate ends of a culture or an individual) which could be used when attempting to resolve a conflict of values. Those who support this type of objectivist pluralism do not deny the need (in some cases) to sacrifice all or one dimension of some of those values, but they consider that sacrifice to be rationally justified. And this would seem to be the case of Berlin. That is, as we saw previously, he thinks that there would be some principles, some values, which cannot be dispensed with; for example, the need for intercommunication (between cultures and between individuals), for a minimum of freedom and equality, the obligation to avoid extreme suffering, etc. Those would be the criteria that would be appropriate to use, or would need to be used when rationally choosing one conflicting value over the other.

This last conception still differs from Dworkin's view, as he does not accept that this type of conflict exists, for reasons that we have already seen. However, it is worth pausing for a moment here in an attempt to more effectively specify what this author really wants to say, at least as I interpret his comments. To do so I will propose some examples taken from the law.

Let us take the well–known situation (imagined by Judge Holmes) in which the spectator shouts "Fire!" in a theatre full of people, when there is actually no fire in the building and his cry is tantamount to creating a risk to all those present. It would be clear to anyone that this is not an action covered by freedom of expression as it is expressed in our constitutions, but the method used to reach that conclusion is different, depending on what—for example, a lawyer would follow for this purpose, a procedure offering a theory of weighting such as Robert Alexy's, or conversely, that suggested by Dworkin. The first of our two legal practitioners would more or less say that given the circumstances, personal safety of people carries much greater weight than freedom of expression so that it would be justified to place a limit on the latter by virtue of the principle of proportionality (weighting in a strict sense); the harm to this value is very small compared to that which would be caused to personal safety, were this limitation not established. Whereas a Dworkinian legal practitioner would argue otherwise, holding that in those circumstances it would be pointless to speak of the "value" of freedom of expression (as there is no value in this type of linguistic action), so that freedom of expression (properly understood) would not have been affected in the slightest: quite simply, no clash between values (or between principles that express values) has occurred; prohibiting someone from shouting "Fire!" in a theatre cannot be considered a restraint on freedom of expression.

This last reasoning can also be applied to the examples that we provided at the start, (or at least, partially). Thus, permission (or non–punishment) in some cases of abortion cannot presuppose an attempt against the dignity of human life (this is not a question of weighing freedom against autonomy), as the value of life (a dignified life) would not begin with conception but at some point subsequent to development of the foetus. The same could be said in respect of euthanasia. Or in the case of surrogate maternity: if this institution is considered to be legitimate, it cannot be because here priority has been given to the potential parents' autonomy, and that of the pregnant woman in respect of her dignity and that of the child, but because it does not affect the dignity of anyone; if this were not the case—that is, if the dignity of persons were at stake—that type of practice would not be justified.

I believe that this way of presenting the "conflicts" between values, that is, Dworkin's way, is perfectly plausible, at least in many cases. Or in other words, not all that the legal practitioners usually call conflicts of values are in actual fact real conflicts, that require weighting in the strictest sense; that is, in many cases there would not seem any point in stating that some values (or principles) cancel out others. But I see two disadvantages to Dworkin's position.

One is that from a practical point of view, there is not really much difference between an approach based on the unity of value and which denies the existence of conflicts between values, and an approach based on evaluative pluralism and which considers (as is customary practice—it seems to me—in our courts) that there are criteria, rational criteria, for resolving, if not all, at least quite a few conflicts arising in legal practice. If we return to the two aforementioned methods, all the difference would appear to be in that some (those who would have recourse to weighting: leaving aside the specificities of weighting as Alexy understands it) start from the premise that there is a conflict between values (or principles or rights) prima facie which would be resolved, when all the elements of the case have been considered, in favour of the reasonable proposal; whereas the Dworkinians would also deliberate, considering the reasons, even though that operation is carried out within a single value, but—it should be recalled—a complex value which has many dimensions. The final normative judgment, however, does not vary and will consist of establishing that shouting "Fire!" in a theatre full of people is prohibited, that the practice of abortion or euthanasia is legal (it should be permitted) if such and such circumstances are present etcetera.

The other disadvantage (but this could be also levelled at many who defend weighting), is that it is not at all clear that both the law and morals need to exclude the existence, despite these being exceptional situations, of tragic cases, that is, cases which cannot be resolved without being detrimental to some essential element of a value, of that which we have good reasons to consider as being an ultimate end. I propose two examples of what I consider to be tragic situations.

One of these would have been that faced by Socrates when, as is common knowledge, he was accused of impiety and ultimately condemned to death. He never stopped considering life as a value (despite reasons given in the Apologia as to why death should not be feared), but he considered that authenticity as a value was superior to continuing to live, and therefore he did not reject the penalty imposed on him. However, unquestionably, his situation was tragic, in those conditions it was impossible to preserve those two values at stake: life and authenticity. And regarding judges who operate in legal systems in many rich countries, the laws that order (through they themselves or the administrative authorities) expulsion of immigrants that have entered the country illegally, are frequently faced with the need to make decisions of a tragic nature; if they did not apply the current law, they would be failing in their duty as authorities subject to higher powers, and would be placing at risk values that we consider essential—in general, those which we relate to the Rule of Law and democracy–: but applying that law, in turn, would appear to be incompatible (at least in many cases) with the requirements of human dignity, as it would be discriminating against someone (depriving them of essential rights) due to circumstances that are beyond their control, having been born in an "inadequate" country.

If we were to ask how someone who subscribed to a conception similar to that of Berlin's evaluative pluralism would react in relation to the questions raised, my response would be that they would probably be in favour of weighting, although this person would still recognise—it seems to me—that Dworkin's position (or that of Kant) takes into account—and perhaps exaggerates—an important element of these situations, namely, the requirement to pursue consistency in moral matters.

Thus, those who adhere to Berlin's thesis could not fail to recognise the existence of tragic cases of dilemmatic situations. However, I see no reason why the thesis of the single correct response should not also be assumed, in relation to the cases that judges are presented with; in Dworkin's version, or in any other slightly weaker form (but in reality, very similar to Dworkin) such as that of Alexy. Subscribing to this thesis presupposes in reality accepting that the values (at least in general) are commensurate; and that there are no cases (or only very exceptionally) of equivalence, or of an absolute tie. In relation to Dworkin, that unit of measurement arises from his idea of human dignity (this is what unity of value consists of); and the practical impossibility of there being a tie, an equivalence between reasons would, according to him,—and I believe he is right in thinking this—be a rather banal thesis: however difficult a legal case may be, ultimately, having deliberated sufficiently on all the circumstances of the case, it is almost impossible for the reasons that favour one decision to be exactly the same as those that defend another alternative decision (judicial issues are generally bivalent).

A Berlinean advocate, as we have seen, would reject any mention of a commensurability of values, but in the sense that they would not believe that situations of conflict can be resolved (or can always be resolved) by utilitarist rule (such as maximisation of wealth or reduction of human suffering) or the famous Rawlsian rule of lexicographical priority of freedom as opposed to equality, nor, of course, would they be prepared to give any credit (I believe that they would be more likely to disdain), construction such as the Alexian formula for weighting. However, moral objectivism presupposes recognition that there are, in fact, some criteria that can be used in cases of conflicting values, as not all the values have the same worth. The criteria that Berlin suggests are, of course less articulate than those of Dworkin (or the three Kantian formulas of the categorical imperative), but they still constitute, as mentioned previously, a version (reduced if you will) of what could well be qualified as human dignity. Perhaps these cannot be applied to all cases in which values conflict. But they do apply to many. And among those many would be, I think, the alleged conflicts of values that have to be resolved by judges in the context of a constitutional state.

Thus a Berlinian jurist would perhaps operate in a similar way to someone who followed Dworkin's or Alexy's conception (in the case of the latter, having dispensed with the numerical paraphernalia). That legal practitioner would find that almost always, having studied the substance of a case, there would be better reasons in favour of one of the two possible solutions; that is, I do not think that taking into account the characteristics of our legal systems (which include constitutions that include values of political liberalism, and the existence of presumptions, burdens of proof and other mechanisms that help to resolve cases), a Berlinean jurist would come across many situations which resulted in a complete tie, perfect equivalence of values, not even when having to face a tragic case, as here, naturally, here could be recourse to the lesser evil which would permit, at least on many occasions, opting rationally for one of the two options available, namely, the least worst.

And finally, I do not believe that this type of jurist would have to opt for the model of weighting that Celano called particularist. That is, either those difficult cases (with conflicting values) would be resolved with the Dworkinian method, or that of weighting, the result of deliberation (which we could call weighting in its broadest sense) which are not simply casuistic solutions, which are valid exclusively for that case, but solutions based on rules, that is, on regulations formulated with a view to universality, although they remain open, at the same time they are likely to be interpreted as defeasible conditionals.

And the conclusion reached by all this is, in my opinion, that it would not be in any way ridiculous to propose a theory of values that combine in some way the Kantian and Dworkinian monism with moral pluralism in a version more or less close to that of Berlin. What I do consider should be ruled out is relativist pluralism, as that is a conception of ethics that does not permit the provision of a foundation for human rights, or for articulating a plausible conception of weighting (considering weighting in a broad sense and equivalent to deliberation).

I believe that on one hand, the unity of value should be considered at the very least as a regulatory idea, a requirement of practical rationality. If this were not the case, it would be at least problematic to speak of unity of practical reason; that is, if moral reasons are ultimate reasons which could be outlined in practical discourse, it would appear that those reasons have to be imbued with some sense of order, they should speak with one voice. It seems to me that this is what is behind our constitutions and declarations of rights (beginning with the UNO) when they use human dignity as the basis of all rights but, at the same time, they continue to recognise that those rights (values or principles) are plural and at least potentially, conflicting. It also underlies the Kantian notion of moral law: a complex unit in which it is possible to distinguish various components or perspectives. And also the Dworkinian theory of unity of value: the diverse elements of dignity—on a personal and social plane—are complemented and provide mutual support.

But this unit also has some limits, or if you will, it comprises a plurality of elements that form a dialectic unity, which will inevitably conflict, and it is not possible to think of some kind of final synthesis in which they will all be reconciled. <span id="page-56-0"></span>Hence the importance in my view of recognising the existence of tragic cases, of irreconcilable tensions, as it is not possible to reach a solution that does not erode an essential aspect of any ultimate end. As we have seen, the Dworkin tendency would seem to deny those situations, in the sense that he would not attribute their existence to values as such but to social reality, it would be a consequence of human activity and, therefore it would be on the plane of empirical reality, not on that of values. But this is hardly satisfactory, and is a rather artificial way of avoiding the real conflict in our past and present societies. I believe that a theory of values has to be adapted to the way our societies have been in the past and as they are today, and what the human beings that live in them are like. And if this taken into account, then inevitably it must be recognised that there are situations in which whoever has to make a decision finds themselves faced with the impossibility of satisfying both evaluative demands raised (albeit many or just one, but with several irreconcilable elements). The only way of avoiding this I think, is to have recourse to a kind of idealisation, albeit Kant's world of noumena, or the thesis of metaphysical independence of the value, things which I am not quite sure are really differ from each other or not.

And in this context, the conflicting vision of history and societies that are represented in Berlin's conception can play a very positive role. As although it is true that the theory of law cannot dispense with aspiring to moral correction, what the law generates, and as a result, also the theory of law is in fact, social conflict.
