# The Legal Meaning of Human Dignity: Respect for Autonomy and Concern for Vulnerability

António Cortês

Abstract Human dignity is the supreme principle that defines the ultimate limits and frontiers of the whole system of basic rights. We must therefore identify its legal meaning, range and specific content. Duties to oneself and self-harm are beyond the limits of law. Legally speaking, only otherness, only one's relationship to others, is relevant. The legal principle of human dignity demands that the humanity in each person should be treated by other people and by the state as an end in itself. This primarily means respecting people's autonomy, freedom of choice and personality. However, it also implies understanding the phenomenic reality of the human being as an embodied and vulnerable creature. People's capabilities must be developed within certain favourable social conditions: some people are especially fragile and therefore need special care from others and/or protection provided by the state and the law; moreover, people's bodies, life and health are vulnerable and technology increases natural risks and dangers. Limit situations in biolaw, such as euthanasia and so-called designer babies, should be discussed in the light of an integral conception of humanity. In fact, treating the humanity in each person as an end in itself implies respecting their autonomy and personality, but also demands that we take human vulnerability into consideration. This conception is essential to defining the boundaries of law.

### 1 The Foundation of Rights and the Limits of Law

Human dignity is the most fundamental principle of justice and law. In a hypothetical original moment of communication on the structure of a well-ordered society, human dignity is the minimum we all would fight for. The system of individual liberties and the equitable social distribution of opportunities and goods necessary for the self-fulfilment of each person logically presupposes a prior moment of

recognition and respect for human dignity.1 Moreover, the limits and frontiers of law defined by the political and judicial powers in each period of history depend on the normative force, meaning and range of this primordial principle.

Human dignity is firmly enshrined in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Preamble refers to the "inherent dignity" of "all members of the human family" and Article 1 solemnly declares that "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights." The idea here is that dignity is not a special honour or aristocratic privilege of the few, but a democratic feature of all human beings.2 Every person is important in their own right.

This principle is also expressly consecrated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Article 1 categorically states: "Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected". The inviolability of human dignity therefore implies that it must not only be respected, but also positively protected by states and the law. Many constitutions also present human dignity as the supreme principle of the legal order and thus the supreme, most radical limit on the validity of all legal norms and decisions.

However, even when constitutions and international conventions such as the European Convention on Human Rights are silent, it may be argued that human dignity underlies and is central to the whole system of rights.3 In fact, the premise that there are human rights and constitutional rights that prevail over ordinary laws is founded on the idea that human beings are the ultimate reason or justification for all legal systems. As Habermas notes, there was always "a close connection" between the concept of human rights and the notion of human dignity, "although initially only implicit", 4 as human dignity is the "moral source that nourishes the contents of all human rights". 5 This idea is reflected in the two binding UN Covenants on Human Rights, adopted in 1966 as further developments of the Universal Declaration, in which it is explicitly proclaimed that the recognized rights therein "derive from the inherent dignity of the human person".

The principle of "equal respect and equal concern", Dworkin's basic norm upon which the entire legal order should be founded, is essentially an appeal to human dignity.6 From a legal perspective, the destiny and life of each person cannot be fully subsumed to considerations of social utility or preservation of communitarian

<sup>1</sup> This means that the two basic principles of justice affirmed by Rawls [(1971,](#page-181-0) 1999), p. 266, are based on the recognition of the equal dignity of each and every person.

<sup>2</sup> Kriele [(2004](#page-180-0)), p. 169, states that human dignity implies that every person, regardless of her capacities or behaviour, possesses a certain nobility, simply by being human.

Government must not only treat people with concern and respect, but with equal concern and respect."

values. Each person matters and deserves respect and concern in their own right and beyond all political, economic, social or scientific reasons.

Human dignity does not adopt the normative form of a "rule" with a hypothetical structure, establishing a certain legal consequence for a well-determined and typified fact situation. It is a "principle" with a categorical normative structure, valid for an unpredictable number of new and complex cases.

However, this principle has one peculiarity: it is a primordial principle, because it is categorical not only in its logical structure, but also in its axiological validity.

In fact, principles and rights are generally subject to possible weighting or balancing. Every principle or right may conflict with other principles or rights. Weighting or balancing is always possible in terms of concrete rights and liberties founded on human dignity, in view of different factual circumstances, but something different happens with the principle of human dignity. It is true that the scope of the principle of human dignity may be debated and that, in order to determine this scope, we must admit value judgments, gradations and even the balancing of different dimensions of "humanity" (for instance, "conscience" and "life"). Nevertheless, the principle of human dignity, within the scope of its application, is always prevalent. In this sense it may be said, quoting Grimm, that dignity "always trumps" and that it is an "absolute right". 7 However, because we see "human dignity" as the basis of rights, in the light of which the whole system of rights should be interpreted and developed, rather than simply as a specific right, we prefer to consider human dignity as a categorical principle.

Therefore, we say it is a primordial principle, a first principle, a "meta-principle", and indeed the highest principle of a just legal system. In fact, justice is an essential goal of law and its first imperative is to give each person their due ("to each his own"; Ulpian's ius suum cuique tribuere), not only by virtue of conventional or statutory law, but above all by virtue of their dignity.

The limits and frontiers of the human rights and constitutional rights system depend, as previously stated, on the normative force, meaning and range of the principle of human dignity. This principle is the cornerstone that defines the limits and frontiers of the system of basic rights, and therefore of the law as a whole.

### 2 The Starting Point: The Kantian Imperative of Humanity and Its Legal Formula

The philosophical development of the idea of human dignity owes its main tenets to Immanuel Kant's practical philosophy.8 Kant's influence on the post-World War II concept of human dignity may, it is true, be debated: historically, the contemporary

<sup>7</sup> Grimm [(2013](#page-180-0)), pp. 386–391, especially, p. 388.

<sup>8</sup> On the influence on Kant's philosophy of the traditional paradigm of human dignity developed by Cicero, Leo the Great and Pico della Mirandola, see Sensen [(2011](#page-181-0)), pp 152–161.

success of the idea of human dignity is closely linked to the "Never Again" response to the Nazi experience9 and is not simply a consequence of Kant's philosophical influence.10 Nevertheless, I believe that Kant's practical philosophy is still the starkest, albeit insufficient, "starting point" for understanding human dignity.

For Kant, the fundamental key to defining the idea of dignity is contained in the second formula of the categorical imperative which lies at the very centre of morality, including law and ethics. The formula is the following: "Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your person or in the person of any other, always simultaneously as an end and never as a mere means". 11

A person is free and therefore an "end in him or herself", that is, a being who is not "a mere plaything of nature" and "not merely a means to the will of another". 12

For Kant, a person is simultaneously "homo noumenon" (a being capable of freedom, "wholly supersensible", a "personality independent of physical attributes") and "homo phaenomenon" (a being affected by physical attributes, a person in her empirical existence).13 The homo noumenon, "humanity" as such, is therefore "the capacity for freedom", or one's personality independent of physical attributes. It is this personality, capacity for freedom and autonomy that must be respected in people.14 Nevertheless, we must be cautious when interpreting the assertion that, for Kant, the concept of dignity "means nothing else than the respect towards a person's autonomy". 15 According to the categorical imperative, "person" has a double meaning: homo noumenon (an autonomous personality, a free and rational being) and homo phaenomenon (the human being in his or her empirical or physical existence). This "complicates" the formula and its application.16

It is nonetheless true that, for Kant, in law and ethics, the noumenal reality of the human being, his or her autonomous personality, is decisive. And autonomy is beyond sensibility: it is a "stoic" autonomy, a rational freedom according to moral law, which implies multiple "duties" to oneself and to others.

The Kantian philosophical framework is still the basic starting point for understanding human dignity as a legal principle. However, for legal purposes, only "duties to others" matter, not duties to oneself. Furthermore, we must understand the notion of "autonomy" in a more realistic way.

<sup>16</sup>See Welzel [(1990](#page-181-0)), p. 172, where he observes that "humanity" has a double meaning: "homo noumenon" and "homo phaenomenon".

First of all, it is necessary to determine whether there is a specifically "legal" formula for the principle of human dignity. We should begin by stating that the way each person treats humanity in his or her own sphere is a matter of ethics or personal morality, but not a matter of law. Only relations between individuals and other people and between individuals and the state are a matter of law. At this point, reference can be made to the notion of the "intrinsic otherness of law". 17 For the law, as a specific normative order, the relevant perspective is not the way in which people, on the basis of self-responsibility, treat themselves. Unless the capacity for autonomous decision is not guaranteed, self-harm without the interference of others is not a matter of law. Only "otherness" concerns the law. From a legal perspective, there are no duties to oneself, only duties to others and the corresponding rights.18

The idea that the law is only concerned with otherness goes back to Aquinas's theory of justice. In fact, Aquinas offered a clear explanation: justice "implies the relationship of one man to another", "justice is concerned only about our dealings with others ( justitia est semper ad alterum)". 19

Although in a more radical and liberal form, the intrinsic otherness of law also underlies John Stuart Mill's harm principle: "The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant". 20

Within the scope of contemporary philosophy of law, Kaufmann also concludes that "apart from their relationships to others, human beings may have religious and moral duties, but not legal ones". 21

Moreover, in law it is important how each person's humanity is treated by other people, but also how it is treated by the state. In fact, as the history of totalitarian regimes clearly shows, states may not only protect and promote, but also offend against human dignity. Human rights therefore appear primarily as rights or liberties against the state. In fact, history is teeming with situations in which states, even democratic ones, surpass the limits of their power, disregarding people and considering them merely as the means towards presumed higher collective or public ends. Sometimes people are treated by the state as disposable objects rather than free agents. Yet the law must ensure that each person is treated with dignity, as an agent and possessor of a sphere of autonomy. The humanity of each individual must be respected.

<sup>17</sup>Domingo [(2010)](#page-180-0), p. 150.

<sup>18</sup>Today we consider human dignity from the perspective of rights: Kant stressed the perspective of duties implied in the consideration of people as autonomous beings. See Cortês [(2005](#page-180-0)), pp. 610–614.

<sup>19</sup>Aquinas [(1947](#page-180-0)), Question 58, Article 2.

<sup>20</sup>Mill [(1989)](#page-180-0), p. 13.

<sup>21</sup>Kaufmann [(1993](#page-180-0)), p. 216.

Taking these arguments concerning the necessary otherness of law into consideration, and the fact that human dignity must also be affirmed in relation to the state, my proposal for the legal formula for the principle of human dignity is as follows:

The humanity in each person shall always be treated by other people and by the state simultaneously as an end in itself and never as a mere means.

#### Or simply:

The humanity in each person shall always be treated by other people and by the state as an end in itself.

People cannot just be a means, that is, useful or disposable "objects" 22 in the hands of others or the state. They must be considered as autonomous beings and ethical personalities, never as a mere means (object) in the hands of the state or other people. In Kantian terms, this implies respect for each man's unique innate right: the right to "liberty". 23 Kant never differentiated between specific human rights and basic liberties,24 as the 1789 Declaration of Rights of Man and of the Citizen did and as many international law instruments do today. Nevertheless, he changed the traditional normative perspective of natural law by clearly placing liberty at the centre of the legal order.

### 3 The Most Obvious Implication: Rights and Liberties as "Trumps" and Limits on Power

The idea of human dignity remains fundamental to understanding the whole logic of human and constitutional rights as "trumps" against the majority. As Dworkin explains, "we need rights ... when some decision that injures some people finds prima-facie support in the claim that it will make the community as a whole better off". 25 In other words, human rights basically limit global utilitarian calculation and communitarian perfectionism. The aggregate maximization of the happiness of the majority, in the manner of Bentham, or the pursuit of a communitarian ideal, perhaps in the manner of Plato's republic or Marx's classless society, should not be achieved by sacrificing the personal liberty of individuals, as if they were disposable or negligible objects, a "mere means" towards a higher communitarian end.

As previously mentioned, each person is of the utmost importance, as an autonomous being with his or her own goals and life plans. Of course, the exercise of rights and freedoms must take "due recognition and respect for the rights and

<sup>22</sup>See Dürig [(2011](#page-180-0)), p. 218: "Human dignity is violated when the concrete human being is degraded to an object, to mere means...".

<sup>23</sup>Kant ([1997](#page-180-0)), p. 345: "The innate right is only one: liberty (the independence towards others' arbitrariness)".

<sup>24</sup>For an emphasis on this point, see Holzleithnerm [(2009](#page-180-0)), p. 88.

<sup>25</sup>Dworkin [(2009](#page-180-0)), p. 166.

freedoms of others" into consideration and, moreover, "everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible" (Article 29 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights).

However, as Seelmann and Demko assert, "The individual never exists [...] exclusively for the good of the other" or for the good of the "community". 26 This implies a basic duty not to sacrifice a person's autonomy for the sake of others or the state. Thus, the law cannot admit the heteronomous use of one person without considering him or her an agent or autonomous pole.

Arguing that rights are trumps means they have priority, which is not to say that they are absolute. No right is an absolute. Every right admits restrictions justified by other rights or even by the basic demands of the common good. However, in speaking of rights as trumps, I mean to convey that it is up to any given power, whether political, economic, social, technological or other, to justify restraints on personal liberty. In fact, human dignity, at the core of which we find personal liberty, is the ultimate reason for all types of power.

A person may be treated as a means, as useful and as having utility as a means of production, for instance, or as a means towards the common good. Nevertheless, human beings should always be "simultaneously" treated as an end in themselves, that is, with humanity. This essentially means respecting their personality and personal freedom—life, physical integrity, personal identity, reputation, privacy and so on. People are treated as an end in themselves when the state and other people respect their humanity as something of prevailing importance, and therefore when the person is not treated as a utilitarian good that offers some kind of advantage to other people or to the state. Personal liberty breaks the logic of utilitarian calculus. Kant's formula does not exclude situations when people choose to freely serve as a means by being useful to benefit another, such as a company or the state, as is the case in a working relationship, for example. Without cooperation, humanity could not achieve any progress. Being useful for the benefit of others or the community corresponds to the basic condition of humanity. What we must exclude is the possibility that the "humanity in each person" may be disregarded as a mere means or mere utility, an object without humanity.

The different dimensions of personal liberties are not equally important but have a distinct normative force in different factual circumstances and may, according to their relative importance, be sacrificed for reasons of strict necessity. However, the principle of human dignity should not lose its categorical force. Personality and the corresponding personal liberties—such as life, physical integrity, personal identity, reputation or privacy—have priority and a prevailing force.

In some cases, the essential nucleus of the principle of human dignity is directly violated. This is particularly the case in extreme forms of nullification of personal liberty such as slavery, torture, the death penalty or punishment without sufficient guilt, even if there is a potential social value to this, such as the prevention of crime.

<sup>26</sup>See Seelmann and Demko [(2014](#page-181-0)), p. 259.

In these cases, the person is reduced to a mere object in the hands of others or the state and is treated as such, as an instrument, not a person or an autonomous agent.

In the case of slavery27 and torture28 in particular, the person's "humanity" amounts to nothing: the person is completely reduced to an instrument in the hands of others. He or she is treated as an object, not as an autonomous agent. His or her personal freedom is nullified by others.

Yet even aside from extreme possibilities such as those mentioned above, in situations where personal liberty is not completely nullified but merely impaired, it is important to affirm that only reasons of strict necessity, based on the rights and liberties of others or on the primary conditions of the common good, may justify a restriction of personal rights and liberties. The more important a specific personal liberty or personal good is, the more important the rights or public interest that justify restricting the personal liberty or good in certain circumstances should be.

The burden of proof always lies with the public powers. It is up to the authorities to justify and explain the specific and concrete reasons for restraining personal liberty. Furthermore, there can be no doubt that aiming to strike a balance is not admissible when the practical nullification of personal liberty is at stake. The "heart" of personal liberty should always be respected.

### 4 Reinventing Human Dignity from the Perspective of "Vulnerability"

The legal formula for human dignity postulates that "The humanity in each person shall always be treated by other people and by the state simultaneously as an end in itself and never as a mere means". Yet does this simply amount to respecting an abstract and decontextualized capacity for freedom? I do not believe so. We must reinvent the Kantian categorical imperative.29 We need an integral concept of humanity. More specifically, we must re-understand the notion of "humanity" in the light of vulnerability. It is impossible to understand human dignity in isolation from human vulnerability.30

Kantian "humanity" must be reinvented or, at least, re-understood. In terms of Kantian practical philosophy (law and ethics), a "person" should be understood

<sup>27</sup>See Scott [(2013)](#page-181-0), p. 74: In the ownership of slaves as property the person is reduced to the legal status of a "thing", but even after its formal abolition, slavery still exists in situations of extremely humiliating and degrading work conditions.

<sup>28</sup>See Rosen [(2018)](#page-181-0), p. 158: "When you torture me, you humiliate and degrade me, but the harm is not just that: you cause me extreme pain and thereby deprive me of effective self-control". 29Linhares [(2007](#page-180-0)), p. 51.

<sup>30</sup>Sedmak [(2013](#page-181-0)), p. 566: "The concept of human dignity is linked with the concept of vulnerability in at least two ways: first, because the concept of human dignity has emerged in confrontation with the fragility of human existence; second because situations of experienced vulnerability prove to be the acid test of human dignity in its entirety".

primarily essentially as a noumenal autonomous being, not as an anthropological reality or phenomenon. Rationality and freedom are specifically "human" and man, as a sensible being with empirical existence, is secondary. I would like to propose another understanding of "humanity" which more clearly assumes the phenomenal or anthropological reality of human beings as persons. In this sense, we may try to reconcile Kant and Aristotle. As Nussbaum observes, being "a great biologist and the son of a doctor, Aristotle was never tempted to view the human being as a disembodied creature" 31 and "he understood human vulnerability". 32

Humanity is not simply man's specific characteristic of rationality and freedom. Humanity is more than animality, yet as is the case with other animals,33 also includes the body, life, health, genetic code, sexuality, procreation, food, shelter and other needs. Of course, the way in which human beings deal with all these realities is specifically human; it is in a certain sense more sophisticated and more rational. The differences must be taken into consideration, but the analogies should not be ignored. Man has similarities with other animals in that he is also a sensitive being, capable of pleasure and suffering.

Humanity is not simply a noumenal, but also an anthropological reality. When we talk about "humanity", what is at stake is the autonomy of sensitive beings with concrete and existential potentialities, needs and inclinations, an autonomy that can be promoted or endangered, not simply a stoic abstract autonomy.

It is very interesting that, for Kant, "humanity" was not static, but something that could be promoted. As Kant writes: "it is not enough the preservation (Erhaltung) of humanity in each person as an end", its "promotion (Beförderung)" 34 is also necessary. The promotion of humanity according to "universal laws" should imply the development of individual "talents" and help for those in "need". 35 Therefore, if the "humanity" in each person is to be treated by the state as an end in itself, a person should not be deprived of the possibility of developing his or her own talents, nor should he or she be deprived of the essential goods or services required to satisfy his or her own basic needs.36

Thus, having started with Kant, we must now think beyond his premises.

<sup>31</sup>Nussbaum ([2011](#page-181-0)), p. 127.

<sup>32</sup>Nussbaum ([2011](#page-181-0)), p. 127.

<sup>33</sup>MacCormick [(2008](#page-180-0)), p. 30, argues that "Humanity [...] is not in radical contrast with animality. [...] There are therefore things that are of value to us simply in virtue of our animal nature".

<sup>34</sup>Kant [(1994](#page-180-0)), p. 53.

<sup>35</sup>Kant [(1994](#page-180-0)), pp. 44–45.

<sup>36</sup>Kant [(1997](#page-180-0)), p. 446: "It is rightful for the government to oblige [through taxes] the rich to supply the means of subsistence to those who are incapable to provide their own most basic natural needs".

First of all, humanity implies certain "central capabilities", 37 as Nussbaum would say, but also basic needs in the Rawlsian sense38 (basic needs will naturally be satisfied if all basic capabilities are secured, but the lack of one single central capability might be enough to prevent one person from satisfying his or her own basic needs). In this context, vulnerability is the difficulty in developing central capabilities, namely through access to "education" (as in Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights), and the difficulty in providing for one's own basic needs, such as "food, clothing, housing and medical care" (as in Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Therefore, in order to treat the humanity in each person as an end in itself, states should create conditions that ensure people are not deprived and are able to develop their "central capabilities" and, on a subsidiary level, the state should ensure that no one is deprived of the essential goods or services required to satisfy their basic needs.39 Aiming to treat the humanity in each person as an end in itself, the law must enlarge its frontiers or limits, protecting in minimum and differentiated terms the so-called social rights—which include education, work, health care and social security—in order to make liberty effective. As Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights stipulates, everyone is entitled, "in accordance with the organization and resources of each state", to "the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality". An economic, social and cultural minimum is a requirement for human dignity: it is a matter of "humanity".

Secondly, the law must assume that some people are especially vulnerable but nevertheless as "human" and entitled to dignity as everybody else. The law must assume that "humanity" does not simply mean autonomy, but also "vulnerability". In this context, we will consider vulnerability as the incapacity or difficulty associated with avoiding harm (being injured) or acting with full autonomy. As Ricoeur has clearly pointed out, Kant stressed autonomy but did not take into sufficient consideration human vulnerability or fragility. Now, human existence is a "paradox of autonomy and vulnerability". 40 Vulnerability, as the incapacity or difficulty associated with avoiding being harmed by others, is part of human existence, and, as Hart showed, the first reason for the inevitable existence of the law.41 However, some human beings, such as children, women in certain contexts and the

<sup>37</sup>Nussbaum [(2011)](#page-181-0), pp. 33–34: capabilities such as life, bodily health, senses, imagination and thought, emotions or capabilities referring to each person's relation to others, to animals and to material things. On page 94, Nussbaum stresses that "the principle of each person as an end [which she defends] is a version of Kant's idea of the duty to respect humanity as an end and never as mere means".

<sup>38</sup>See Rawls [(1996](#page-181-0)), p. 166: "below a certain level of material and social well-being and education, people simply cannot take part in a society as citizens".

<sup>39</sup>Connecting a "social minimum" ("Existenzminimum") to human dignity, see Seelmann and Demko ([2014)](#page-181-0), p. 245, and Shaber ([2016)](#page-181-0), pp. 257, 260 and 261.

<sup>40</sup>Ricoeur [(2001](#page-181-0)), pp. 85–105.

<sup>41</sup>Hart [(1994](#page-180-0)), pp. 194–195. In fact, "human vulnerability" is the first truism that justifies the "minimum content of natural law".

handicapped, disabled or terminally ill, are especially vulnerable. In more general terms, this includes any person subject to discrimination, whether due to race, colour, sex, language, national or social origin, or property (as in Article 2 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). Their autonomy and their personality must not only be respected, but also protected by the state and the law (see again, in particular, Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, based on the tradition of the post-World War II German Basic Law). Treating these people's humanity as an end in itself means considering them as they are, that is, in their specific fragility, with separate levels of, and potential for, autonomy. This vulnerability demands special protection by the law and sometimes—as in the case of children or handicapped and terminally ill people—care by others.

Finally, we must remember that Kant died at the beginning of the nineteenth century. He could never have imagined the risks that scientific and technological development would impose on nature, on which human beings depend (climate change being the most glaring example), far less the risks of applying technology to human beings themselves, through genetic manipulation of reproductive cells (maybe "the most serious question that can be posed to man" in the age of technology42). Humanity is not simply rationality and freedom, but also its physical and biological support. Being human does not simply mean being rational and free, but also having a body and being a specific animal. Our body, our life and our health are vulnerable. Genetics deals with the most delicate equilibria of our vulnerable nature. In fact, the genome is a very complex book of instructions for our cells and organs, including the brain. When we change one single gene, it may cause immediate and/or unpredictable long-term problems for the whole equilibria of the human DNA. We would do well to recall Hans Jonas' imperative of responsibility, contained in the formula "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life", or expressed negatively as "Act so that the effects of your action are not destructive of the future possibility of such life". 43 It is only with this sense of responsibility towards the uncertainties of biotechnology that we may claim to be respecting "humanity" as an end in itself.

### 5 Humanity in Biolaw Limit Situations: The Question of Voluntary Euthanasia and the So-Called Designer Babies

We should interpret the principle of dignity as applied to complex problems in biolaw in the light of the above notion of "humanity". What are the limits on medicine imposed by the legal principle of human dignity? Let us now turn to issues such as euthanasia or parents choosing their children's genetic features. Is Dworkin, who accepts both voluntary euthanasia44 and designer babies,45 right or wrong? In my view, he overestimates ethical independence and undervalues the full meaning of "humanity" as vulnerability.

Let us start with the difficult question of voluntary euthanasia. The law cannot forbid suicide (otherness of law), nor can it compel people to receive medical care that they, in full awareness, do not wish to have (patient's autonomy). If the legislative power attempted to forbid suicide or compel people to receive unwanted medical care, it would exceed the limits of law. However, in principle, the law may never leave homicide unpunished, leading to the controversial matter of voluntary euthanasia, which takes place when a doctor not only witnesses the death of a patient but also, in accordance with the patient's wishes, kills him or her, even though this is done at their bidding and in a context of irreversible extreme suffering. This question must be examined, as Seelmann and Demko suggest, without legal paternalism or the imposition of a unique image of the person. Nevertheless, we must treat the humanity in each person as an end in itself, because human dignity is the supreme limit of law. Dworkin accepts voluntary euthanasia, even if he affirms the "sanctity of life" conceived in its dual dimension: biological and biographical. However, he does not consider the minimal content of the "ethics of care" as a precondition for any discussion on voluntary euthanasia. He does not consider palliative care (on a medical, social, psychological and spiritual level), the caregiver's status, or the procedure to secure true autonomy (the procedure to ensure that the request for euthanasia is not just a request for the care of others in the context of extreme suffering). Dworkin respects individual freedom of choice, the choice of a personal biography, but does not take the demands of personal vulnerability into sufficient consideration.

On the contrary, it seems to me that the law would exceed its limits, imposed by human dignity, if it were to decriminalize euthanasia simply as a consequence of freedom of choice in situations of terminal illness with irreversible and unbearable suffering, without guaranteeing that the vulnerable person had previously had access to a reasonable standard of palliative care (or physical and moral pain relief). A law that intends to decriminalize euthanasia merely as a matter of abstract freedom of choice, ignoring this ethics of care (as an ethics of life and active compassion), does

not respect "humanity" (the autonomy of sensitive beings) as an end in itself and therefore exceeds the limits of valid law. Freedom of choice in situations of extreme irreversible suffering, and thus of extreme vulnerability, is inconceivable without very strict and demanding procedural conditions in the context of an ethics of care or active compassion.

Dworkin also accepts human genetic engineering, assuming, in line with Rawls, that the "genetic lottery" is a source of injustice. He accepts the idea of so-called designer babies: children genetically manipulated to have certain specific physical or intellectual attributes, a possibility made more and more plausible by recent "gene editing" techniques which could be applied to man in the future. From Dworkin's point of view, talents are good and positive and thus if we can improve them, we may do so: "there is nothing in itself wrong with the detached ambition to make the lives of future generations of human beings longer and more full of talent and hence achievement". 46 I believe, however, that the legal principle of human dignity must lead us to draw a very clear boundary in the case of genetic engineering and that this principle is incompatible with the possibility of designer babies.

a Sandel contends, following Habermas, that "to think of ourselves as free, we must be able to ascribe our origins "to a beginning which eludes human disposal", beginning that arises from "something – like God or nature – that is not at the disposal of some other person"". 47

This premise cannot be fully accepted. Taking this idea to the extreme would exclude the possibility of reproductive medicine and even the possibility of family planning. The very existence of a child usually depends not only on some transcendent reality (such as God or nature), but also on the responsible choice of his or her parents.

We must nevertheless reject the possibility of the genetic editing of babies.

The genetic manipulation of human beings involves risks and uncertainties that are difficult to control and implies treating the humanity in each person as a mere means to perform the arbitrary preferences of others. A law based on human dignity must distinguish between, on the one hand, the legitimate aim of avoiding a serious illness with a well-determined origin leading to unusual suffering, as a universally shared desire that can be achieved without the risks of genetic manipulation through pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and, on the other hand, the illegitimate promotion of eugenics through gene editing, according to the arbitrary preferences of parents, which risks destroying the delicate equilibria of the genetic constitution of the human being.

When Dworkin argues that genetic engineering based on "ethical individualism"

is admissible, given the "absence of positive evidence of danger", he disregards the precautionary principle, according to which the more uncertain the effects of 48

technology are, the more we should refrain from using it. As Hans Jonas explains: "Experience has taught us that developments set in motion by technological acts with short-term aims tend to make themselves independent, that is, to gather their own compulsive dynamics, an automotive momentum, by which they become not only, as pointed out, irreversible but also forward-pushing and thus overtake the plans of the initiators." 49 In genetics, given the risks of irreversible harm for future generations, we should always adopt Hans Jonas's principle of the "prevalence of bad over good prognosis" 50 and an "ethics of preservation and prevention, not of progress and perfection". 51 We must therefore reject the "extreme anthropocentrism, to which all of nature (including human) is but a means for the self-making of a still unfinished man". 52

Moreover, even if we consider the improbable hypothesis that there are no risks to human physical and mental health, human dignity implies respect for human plurality and imperfection, for the plural differences and natural vulnerabilities of each person as he or she is. We cannot transform human procreation into a global competition for perfection without endangering the idea that people are ends in themselves. We should not abandon the Kantian premise that perfection is a duty of virtue that each person has to oneself53; it is not something to be imposed, without the autonomous collaboration of the self, by others or the state. Perfectionism without consideration for personal autonomy is not simply a dangerous ideology, but an ideology incompatible with the limits of human dignity.

There is therefore a legal imperative to preserve the genetic identity of the human being, a right to genetic integrity, which categorically forbids so-called designer babies.

### 6 Conclusion: Respect for Autonomy and Concern for Vulnerability

The legal formula for the categorical imperative is this: "The humanity in each person shall always be treated by other people and by the state simultaneously as an end in itself and never as a mere means". A person is never merely a useful or disposable object in the hands of other people or the state. Treating the humanity in each person as an end signifies respecting their autonomy, but also taking their vulnerability into consideration. In order to consider vulnerability, the law should

<span id="page-180-0"></span>expand its boundaries beyond the strict purpose of securing autonomy and civil liberties. Respect for personality and autonomy, and concern for vulnerability are the essential objectives of a law oriented by human dignity.

The limits of law must always be defined in the light of human dignity. On the one hand, the law should respect its limits in restricting personal freedom and, on the other hand, it should expand its frontiers in response to the multiple forms of human vulnerability.
