A Response to Brettschneider

*Larry Alexander*

## **I. The Paradox of Liberalism**

Liberalism's hallmark is its endorsement of certain basic freedoms: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom of association. Yet the content of some speech, religious doctrines, and criteria of association are inconsistent with liberalism's tenets. Speech might advocate restrictions on speech as well as the abolition of democracy, the expulsion of religious and racial groups, and so forth. So might religious doctrines. And associations might require various "illiberal" conditions for membership and might seek to advance various "illiberal" goals. I shall refer to illiberal speech, religion, and association as "illiberalism" for short.

What should be the liberal state's response to illiberalism? If it outlaws illiberalism, its credentials as a liberal state appear to be undermined. If it permits illiberalism, it licenses Robert Frost's derogatory quip that liberalism can't take its own side in an argument. Either way, liberalism appears self-contradictory and incoherent. It must either betray its principles or betray itself (and thereby betray its principles). Liberalism both appears to be possible—we've seen it done—and impossible (it can't be done).

That is, in brief, the paradox of liberalism. Elsewhere, I have diagnosed the problem as one that stems from the impossible-to-realize idea of evaluative neutrality that defines the liberal freedoms.1 I there argued that the paradox was real and insoluble.

## **II. The Brettschneider Solution: Paradox Lost**

Corey Brettschneider, in his contribution to this book (see chapter 19) and in his monograph, *When the State Speaks, What Should It Say? How Democracies Can Protect Expression and Promote Equality*,2 believes he can cut the Gordian Knot of this paradox. Although his focus is on freedom of speech, his approach has obvious applications to religion and association as well. My discussion, like his, will be focused on freedom of speech. What I say about his approach in that context will, however, apply to that approach in the religion and association contexts as well.

<sup>1</sup> Larry Alexander, *Is There a Right of Freedom of Expression?* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2005).

<sup>2</sup> Corey Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks, What Should It Say? How Democracies Can Protect Expression and Promote Equality* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2012).

Brettschneider's solution to the paradox is to distinguish between government coercion and government persuasion. Coercing illiberal speech by punishing it would be an illiberal government response. On the other hand, countering illiberal speech by publicly arguing for liberalism and its fundamental tenets—the free and equal citizenship of all—is perfectly consistent with liberalism. And although this argument is prominent in Brettschneider's book but not in his contribution here, there he contends that government is also permitted to refuse to subsidize illiberal speech, religions, and associations on an equal basis with speech, religions, and associations that are not illiberal. For refusals to subsidize are not coercive. So the government *can* take its own side in an argument so long as it is doing so non-coercively, as when it speaks and subsidizes on behalf of liberalism. Paradox solved!

### **III. Paradox Regained**

Although I believe Brettschneider has made a valiant attempt at solving the paradox of liberalism, the sword he has wielded has left the knot that is the paradox intact. Indeed, Brettschneider's sword is, I believe, more dangerous to liberalism in today's world than the illiberalisms that generate the paradox.

#### **A.╇ Just hate speech and hate groups?**

Brettschneider writes as if the major illiberal threats were hate speech and hate groups. Although he isn't clear on this point, I take Brettschneider to view the threat of hate speech to stem from the possibility that unless it is countered, enough others might be persuaded by it to eventually abandon the key values of liberalism and deny equal rights to the targets of hate speech. I do not take his principal worry to be that hate speech might offend its targets and cause them emotional upset. Although the emotional upset caused by offense is undoubtedly painful, that is not the harm that concerns Brettschneider. Plenty of speech that he would protect can cause emotional pain.

Brettschneider's examples are typically Nazis, the Klan, the producer of an anti-Muslim video, and (in his book) Bob Jones University, a small college that banned interracial dating. In all truth, the purveyors of hate that Brettschneider identifies are realistically no threat to anyone's status as a free and equal citizen. They are beyond marginal. (The only substantial group Brettschneider attacks as a hate group is the Boy Scouts because of their exclusion of gays—but not because of their exclusion of girls, or the Girl Scouts for their exclusion of boys.)

The real threats to liberalism and to the free and equal citizenship of all come not from hate speech, and surely not from the marginal characters Brettschneider identifies. The real threats are more likely the advocacy of policies that will threaten national bankruptcy or persistent high unemployment, or that force major religious groups to bend to governmental demands they oppose in conscience. Economic stagnation and decline might usher in wholesale scapegoating of certain groups. It might lead to a coup and autocracy. Think about Weimar Germany or Argentina in the 1930s. Measures opposed by religions with a significant number of devout adherents might likewise threaten to bring down liberal democracy.

Indeed, it could plausibly be argued that racist and sexist speech, Brettschneider's villains, is far less likely a threat to free and equal citizenship than the current millet regime of preferences for various groups. The latter fosters an unhealthy identity politics that balkanizes the populace and pits groups against one another in a competition over scarce benefits. My guess is that these group preferences are a far greater threat to free and equal citizenship than the tiny number of Nazis, Klansmen, and their sympathizers.

If this is a correct diagnosis of where the real threats to free and equal citizenship reside, what would Brettschneider urge the government to do—assuming, of course, that it is the opposition, not the government in power itself, that is advocating these dangerous (to liberalism) policies? Speak out against monetary and fiscal excesses? Speak out against intruding too much on religious conscience? Speak out against group preferences? Refuse to subsidize groups that advocate imprudent spending measures, measures vehemently opposed by some religions, or group preferences? Do we really want government *qua* government, as opposed to politicians and citizens, to enter these battles over policy? The outcomes of these battles, however, and not the kinds of hate speech and hate groups that Brettschneider identifies, are likely the truly consequential ones for the future of free and equal citizenship.

#### **B.╇ Will government be effective?**

If illiberal policies have gained enough popular support to truly threaten free and equal citizenship, will the non-coercive measures Brettschneider proposes be successful in preventing the eventual success of those policies? Perhaps, though there is reason to doubt that they will. Government speech, as opposed to speech by particular members of the government, will be viewed by many as bureaucratically generated propaganda. (Imagine, if you will, government public service announcements on radio and television telling people "Don't believe the Klan; blacks should be regarded as equals." Would these persuade people who would otherwise have been persuaded by the Klan? Or would they on balance bring more attention to the Klan's message than the Klan could have garnered on its own? Often, the most effective repudiation of an idea in terms of effect on the public is for its expression to be "loudly" ignored.)

The threat to withdraw or withhold various subsidies is likely to be more effective in modifying behavior than is government speech. Brettschneider distinguishes between coercive measures, which he believes are illiberal, and refusals to subsidize, which he believes are not illiberal. I shall raise doubts about his distinction in sections III.C, III.E, and III.F of this chapter.

#### **C.╇ Whose liberalism?**

The core of liberalism for Brettschneider, underlying the freedoms of speech, religion, and association as well as democracy, is the notion of free and equal citizenship. That notion, however, can either be regarded as a "thin" one or a "thick" one. Regarded as a "thin" notion, free and equal citizenship would be consistent with libertarianism, the welfare state, luck egalitarianism, thoroughgoing egalitarianism, perfectionist liberalism, and a number of other versions of liberalism. The "thin" notion is analogous to the Rawlsian overlapping consensus among reasonable views of the Good.

Free and equal citizenship might, however, be regarded as a thick notion, with definite implications for the choice among liberalisms. My own view, which I shall merely state but not defend here, is that thin views are philosophical cop-outs. "Free and equal," to be defensible, should have thick normative implications. And if it does, then much more speech will be illiberal than will be on a thin notion.

Moreover, if free and equal is a thick notion, but there is disagreement over *which* particular thick notion it is, then when government speaks out against illiberal speech and religion, its speech will reflect the partisan views of whoever has managed to take control of propaganda. If those who are currently in control of the government believe, say, that "free and equal" entails luck egalitarianism, they will deem advocacy of libertarianism and thoroughgoing egalitarianism to be illiberal speech. On Brettschneider's view, then, government should speak out against those views and refuse to subsidize groups that promote those views. When those with a different conception of "free and equal" ascend to power however, the tables will be turned, and the luck egalitarians will have their government subsidies withdrawn and their views publicly denounced.

One can see why Brettschneider would prefer a thin conception of free and equal citizenship, as it makes his endorsements of government counter-speech and withdrawals of subsidies more palatable.3 Only "unreasonable" views, those outside the liberal overlapping consensus, would be the targets of governmental speech and subsidy policies. But whether "free and equal" can be given a coherent and non-arbitrary thin reading is, as I said, a matter about which I have a serious doubt.

Here is a related point. Just when does speech qualify as hate speech even on the "thin" conception of free and equal? What if someone speaks out against gays, not because he denies their equal worth, but because he believes gay *sex* is immoral? Or what if he believes gay men serving as boy scout leaders or as infantry men, being sexually attracted to persons of the same sex, will be more prone to improper or disruptive sexual liaisons than heterosexual men? If he speaks out on these subjects, has he engaged in hate speech? Or what if one urges that Muslims not be hired by the CIA, not because he denies their equal worth, but because he believes their beliefs make them security risks? Or what if one urges discrimination against blacks or women based on statistical predictions rather than bigotry? Hate speech?

#### **D.╇ Whose hate speech?**

Even on a thin conception of free and equal citizenship, however, Brettschneider seems to lack the courage of his convictions. As I said, the principal purveyors of hate speech that he mentions are anti-black and anti-Semitic groups like the Klan and the Nazis.

<sup>3</sup> Indeed, Brettschneider makes it clear that advocacy of libertarianism is not a denial of free and equal citizenship even though it is obviously not Brettschneider's own conception of liberalism. Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 36. Thus, he favors the "thin" notion of free and equal citizenship. Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 14, 19–21, 53–5.

And in his book, the one example of withdrawal of a subsidy that serves as his model for a proper subsidy policy is the Internal Revenue Service's denial of tax exempt status to Bob Jones University because of its rule against interracial dating.4

To repeat, the Nazis, the Klan, and Bob Jones University are truly fringe groups. What is curious is why Brettschneider singles out them rather than much more significant groups. For example, he never mentions the virulent anti-white and anti-Semitic views of Black Muslims or the New Black Panthers, nor the anti-gay and misogynistic views of elements of Islam. Nor does he mention the homophobic views heard in many black churches. And while he endorses the withdrawal of the subsidies for Bob Jones University for its religiously motivated policy of racial segregation in dating, he gives a pass to the sex discrimination of the Catholic Church and the sex segregation in Orthodox Judaism.5

Brettschneider's arguments for not withholding subsidies and tax exempt status from the Catholic Church and Orthodox Judaism, and for not urging the government to publicly gainsay the tenets of Catholicism and Orthodox Judaism, are quite strained.6 He distinguishes between a church's theological doctrines that have implications only for matters within the church and those that implicate statuses in the wider society. The Catholic Church's ban on women priests and opposition to gay marriage, and Orthodox Judaism's similar distinctions between men and women and straights and gays, surely spill over into public policy positions, particularly with respect to gay marriage. Moreover, Brettschneider's position regarding Catholicism and Orthodox Judaism seems flagrantly inconsistent with what he says about the Christian Legal Society (CLS), the group that lost its suit for recognition as an officially recognized student group at Hastings Law School.7 The CLS did not deny anyone membership and only banned from leadership positions persons who had engaged in extramarital sex. (Because gay marriage was not available at the time, the rule against extramarital sex impacted gays more severely than others; but non-gays were also excluded, and gays who were chaste were not.) Brettschneider incredibly dismisses the distinction between status and conduct with the offhand remark that "such an attempted distinction between status and choice of behavior is inconsistent with the ideal of free and equal citizenship."8 I call that remark incredible because it would imply that any organization that requires particular conduct or forbearance from particular conduct as a condition for membership, particularly if it advocates that conduct or forbearance as a public ideal, has engaged in hate speech, inimical to free and equal citizenship. Thus, if one's organization takes a stand against adulterers or polygamists, not to mention murderers and rapists, it should be publicly denounced and denied tax exempt status! (Is condemning adultery hate speech directed at adulterers because of their status? Can we not hate the sin but love the sinner?) I find it hard to believe

5 See Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 134–6.

6 Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 134–6.

7 Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 117–20. The case is *Christian Legal Society v. Martinez*, 561 U.S. 661 (2010).

<sup>8</sup> Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 119–20.

Brettschneider really believes that condemning conduct is condemning status, but what he says about the CLS surely suggests that he does.

Nor does Brettschneider mention the satirizing of Mormonism in the Broadway musical, *The Book of Mormon*, even though I suspect he would have condemned as hate speech a similar satire of blacks or Muslims—indeed, he mentions the anti-Muslim video as an example of hate speech. There's much more than a whiff of political correctness in this. It is far more palatable to pick on the Klan, the CLS, and Bob Jones than on Catholics and Orthodox Jews, Black Panthers and Black Muslims, or successful Broadway musicals.9

My point here is that identifying hate speech that government *qua* government should, according to Brettschneider, publicly condemn, will likely turn out to be much more partisan a matter than Brettschneider imagines. Experience on campuses with speech codes should alert one to this danger. And the worry is only amplified by Brettschneider's remarkably selective application of his own theory.

#### **E.╇ What's a subsidy?**

Brettschneider approves of the government's not subsidizing illiberal groups even if otherwise comparable groups are receiving government subsidies. In the *Bob Jones* case, the subsidy at issue was the tax exempt status granted to charitable and educational institutions. On Brettschneider's view, tax exempt status is government largesse and equivalent to a monetary grant. For him, treating illiberal groups unequally with other groups with respect to such largesse is perfectly acceptable and indeed commendable.

To determine whether some benefit is a subsidy, however, we need to know what the baseline is. If the baseline is that charitable and educational organizations pay taxes on the donations they receive, and the donors get no tax deductions, then Bob Jones University did suffer the withdrawal of a subsidy, as Brettschneider contends. Perhaps the proper baseline for determining subsidies, which would explain the Bob Jones outcome, is that it is the worst condition in which the government could constitutionally place the organization. If the government could deny tax exempt status and charitable deductions across the board, then the baseline for Bob Jones University is no tax exempt status. That status was a subsidy, which has now been withdrawn.

Suppose, however, that Bob Jones University needs a level of fire and police protection, the cost of which exceeds the share of its taxes that goes to pay for fire and police services. If the government provides Bob Jones with the fire and police protection it needs, is it thereby subsidizing Bob Jones? Could it then withdraw police and fire protection beyond the amount Bob Jones's taxes pay for as a withdrawal or withholding of a "subsidy"?

<sup>9</sup> Hillary Clinton, too, denounced the anti-Muslim video, but she attended, apparently enjoyed, and surely did not denounce *The Book of Mormon*. Nor did she condemn Andres Serrano's Piss Christ, featuring a crucifix immersed in the "artist's" urine, which was originally exhibited with the support of federal money. Was that "hate speech" on a par with the anti-Muslim video, and if not, why not?

My point here is only that if certain groups because of their views or practices need not be subsidized by government, we need to know when they are being subsidized. And it will not be an uncontroversial matter whether a group denied some governmental benefit or service is having a subsidy withdrawn or withheld or is instead being penalized for its illiberal views.

#### **F.╇ Regulatory subsidies**

We might imagine that subsidies exclusively consist of monetary benefits, such as cash, services, or exemption from taxation. However, there are other forms subsidies can take. For example, in *Police Department of City of Chicago v. Mosely*,10 the teachers' unions were exempted from a regulation banning picketing near a school in session. The Supreme Court held that the exemption unconstitutionally treated some speakers (the teachers' unions) better than others (everyone else). The Court in another contemporaneous case (*Grayned v. City of Rockford*)11 had approved of a complete ban on demonstrations, such as picketing, near schools. So if the latter decision was correct, the unions in *Mosely* were receiving a subsidy, one that the Court thought illegitimate. For exemption from regulations that comparable others are subject to *is* a subsidy, albeit a regulatory rather than a monetary one.

It follows from this that on Brettschneider's view of *Bob Jones*, illiberal groups could be singled out for regulations that did not apply to any other groups—so long, that is, that it would have been permissible to subject everyone to such regulations. If all groups of comparable income could be taxed at a 95 percent rate, then illiberal groups could be taxed at that rate even if other comparable groups were not taxed at all. Once we know the extent of the permissible regulatory regime, we can subject illiberal groups to its full extent while regulating all other groups with a much lighter hand. For we are "subsidizing" the latter groups rather than penalizing the former.

In his book, Brettschneider attempts to allay this concern. He argues there that hate groups have a right, not just to advocate their views, but to have the resources necessary for such advocacy. If, for example, other groups are allowed to hold rallies under conditions that impose costs on the public, hate groups must also be allowed to do so.12 I think Brettschneider is being inconsistent here. If the costs to the public are such that all groups could have been denied the right to hold rallies at the times and places in question, then the groups that are allowed to do so are receiving a regulatory subsidy, which the hate groups can, by hypothesis, be denied.

#### **G.╇ Is government speech coercive?**

The principal axiom on which Brettschneider relies for his claim to have solved the paradox of liberalism is that government speech and government subsidies of speakers it favors do not coerce the disfavored speakers. Their speech is not banned nor penalized. It is merely subjected to governmental counterspeech and not subsidized.

> 10 408 U.S. 92 (1972). 11 408 U.S. 104 (1972). 12 Brettschneider, *When the State Speaks*, 113–14.

Now I have already noted the difficulty of determining whether a group is being penalized or is only not being subsidized. As I said, if the proper baseline for determining what is a subsidy is the maximum scope of the government's coercive reach, then groups engaging in hate speech can be treated quite harshly without being coerced. If government could permissibly ban most demonstrations, signage, and public speeches because of non-message related concerns, then denying only hate groups these avenues for expression would only be denying them "subsidies."

Beyond the problem of defining subsidies is the reality that government counterspeech uses resources that are in part extracted coercively from those whose speech is countered. That is, government speech costs money, money forcibly extracted from taxpayers, many of whom may object to government's message. As I pointed out in my book on freedom of expression, government speech and monetary subsidies, which are paid for in part by taxpayers who object to government's messages, leave those taxpayers with fewer resources for advocating their opposing views.13 Depending upon how much the government speaks and how much it subsidizes groups other than the illiberal groups—and this could be a substantial amount depending upon what the baseline for deeming something a "subsidy" is14—the resource loss for those opposing the government's message might be crippling.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has been quite tough on schemes that force some to pay for others' speech with which they disagree. In a series of cases it has held such schemes to be violations of the freedom of speech of the dissenters.15 And it has also held violative of freedom of speech laws that penalize speech beyond a certain amount by funding opposing speech.16

Brettschneider might believe those cases were wrongly decided. However, even he, I suspect, would object to a government speech campaign on behalf of, say, classical liberalism, with government urging support of classical liberal candidates and subsidizing classical liberal groups but not more redistributionist liberal groups.

Of course, he will reply that government should only oppose hate groups and support a thin version of liberalism. I have already discussed that point. The point here, however, is that if Brettschneider thinks it wrong and violative of his right of free speech for government to be partisan on behalf of liberal principles that he opposes, it must be because he believes such government partisanship is akin to a penalty on those who oppose it. And members of hate groups would feel no differently about governmental opposition in the form of speech or discriminatory subsidies.

In short, it is a mistake to think that Brettschneider's speech and subsidy approach to hate groups is not coercive. It does not, it is true, send people to jail for voicing illiberal views. But it does coercively extract resources from them to support views they oppose, leaving them with fewer resources with which to advance their views.

## **IV. Conclusion**

So what have I shown in my criticisms of Brettschneider's views? I have not shown that government speech opposing hate groups is necessarily wrongheaded or a violation of anyone's rights. Nor have I shown that withdrawing "subsidies" from hate groups is necessarily wrongheaded or a violation of rights. All I have shown is that these policies, which are the policies Brettschneider advocates, do not escape the paradox of liberalism. They exemplify instead one side of that paradox—liberalism acting illiberally towards illiberal groups. Because the paradox is inescapable, however, the policies Brettschneider advocates cannot be faulted for not escaping it.

To say that these policies are not necessarily wrongheaded is not to say that they are wise. Indeed, they may be quite unwise, even dangerous. As I argued, "thin" versions of liberalism are philosophically unsatisfying. Because of that, there will be an everpresent temptation for those in power to translate the thin values of liberty and equality into the thick versions of liberalism they happen to favor. And a likely, if not strictly necessary, consequence of enforcing a thick version of liberalism will be a tendency to see those who oppose that thick version on behalf of a different thick version as themselves illiberal hate groups. Thin liberalism easily evolves into thick, and thick liberalism easily evolves into illiberalism.

There is plenty of evidence that this is not armchair hysteria. Colleges have labeled those opposing affirmative action as racists and in some cases subjected them to hate speech prosecutions. The same is true of mandated diversity sensitivity training. Indeed, Brettschneider himself unwittingly exposes this tendency in both his selectivity about whom to label as hate groups and in his comments about the CLS. It is just far too easy for those in power to convince themselves that those who oppose their policies are, despite their rhetoric, really illiberal haters.

Liberalism, and its central liberties of freedom of expression, religion, and association, is a theoretical contradiction. Its successes are instead pragmatic ones. And from my armchair, I have more pragmatic worries about Brettschneider's prescriptions than about the problems for which he offers them.
