*Carol C. Gould*

### **I. Introduction**

The individualism of human rights has been regarded as both their strength and their weakness. As claims that individuals can make against the state and even perhaps against all other individuals for their fulfillment, these rights centrally appeal to an important notion of the inviolability of persons. Further, as pertaining to each individual simply in virtue of that person's humanity, such rights have a universalistic, and in this respect an egalitarian, dimension, stretching in a cosmopolitan way across time and place. Nonetheless, this strength has at the same time been held to constitute a profound weakness in the very conception of a human right. Insofar as such rights assert basic claims of each individual against others, an emphasis on human rights is thought to neglect our social nature, and the need for social cooperation for the achievement of most human goods. This putative asociality would also divert attention from the problematic power relations and forms of oppression that most urgently need to be redressed in contemporary forms of society.

In this chapter, I will consider the philosophical basis for human rights and argue—in contrast to such views—that human rights are in important ways based on sociality and are themselves fundamentally social or relational conceptions, in ways that existing interpretations of them most often fail to recognize. Such relationality at the root of human rights will be seen to go beyond the correlativity of rights to duties or of rights to responsibilities. Further, when properly interpreted, the fulfillment of human rights, when understood in connection with the central norm of equal freedom, is implied by any critique we might give of domination and exploitation. The recognition of human rights, I suggest, can foster social cooperation while at the same time preserve an important regard for individuality. In order to develop these sizeable claims, I will appeal to what I have previously called social ontology1 and show its import for our understanding of human rights norms.

1 I originally used this term and elaborated a conception of social ontology in a short course on *Marx's Social Ontology* at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1975, and subsequently in the book of the same title (Carol C. Gould, *Marx's Social Ontology* (Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1978)). A work that influenced me in constructing the term was Lukacs's *Zur Ontologie des gesellschaftslichen Seins*, 3 vols. (Neuwied: Luchterhand, 1971–73). It has recently come to my attention that the term social ontology was used by Joseph Gittler in 1950 in "Social Ontology and the Criteria for Definitions in Sociology," *The Midwest Sociologist*, 13(1) (1950): 8. In recent decades, the term, as well as the general project to which it refers, has become a commonplace in social philosophy. It has, of course, been variably interpreted, from views that seek to place sociality in the context of material factors to more phenomenological approaches. My own account takes social ontology as a theory of the nature of social reality, in terms of its basic entities, relations, and processes, and operates within an experiential or phenomenological framework. It is to be understood as a regional ontology rather than as a metaphysical theory.

In proposing this revisionist understanding of the philosophical basis of human rights, the investigation that follows will go beyond understanding these rights as primarily legal ones that hold against nation-states. The account will focus on their fundamental moral and social dimensions, which I believe can also serve to provide guidelines for interpreting and expanding existing legal notions of human rights. Within the moral sphere itself, it will be evident that we need to go beyond the idea, originally powerfully articulated by Henry Shue, that "human rights are the morality of the depths."2 Rather, the suggestion will be that these norms can and should play a much broader role within social and political life. Further, while traditional views most often take human rights to protect individuals against grave wrongs perpetrated against them by their own nation-states or their governments, for example, in the case of torture or the abrogation of freedom of speech or unreasonable search and seizure, the perspective here follows recent developments in political philosophy that take human rights to require wider-ranging institutional structures (including economic, as well as political, ones), along with transnational, rather than strictly national, institutions, if the rights are to be adequately fulfilled.

Likewise, human rights will be understood to range over a variety of economic and social rights, as well as civil and political ones. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides a useful starting point for this sort of broad legal/moral account (despite its unsystematic and rather too extensive list), and many theorists have followed its approach by regarding the various enunciated rights as mutually interdependent. On this issue, I will instead maintain the distinction I introduced in previous work between basic and nonbasic human rights, keeping in mind that the latter remain essential, if not primary.3 (This distinction between basic and nonbasic human rights makes a human rights framework considerably more practicable than if all the rights are taken as wholly interdependent.)

In what follows, I will delineate key features of my own approach by way of a critical review of a few of the prominent accounts of human rights, focusing on how those accounts either incorporate or fail to adequately incorporate a conception of human sociality. Specifically, I will raise some concerns about the otherwise strong agency approaches of James Griffin and Alan Gewirth, which, I suggest, at important junctures end up not being social enough, and I will consider my own alternative in relation to theirs. I will then turn to two (disparate) approaches that emphasize sociality or certain social and legal practices as at the basis of human rights—those of Jürgen Habermas and of Charles Beitz—but will suggest that these views are (in different ways) ultimately unable to give an account of human rights as well-supported and fully universalist norms.

These critical considerations pose two large and difficult problems for the alternative account proposed here. First, and rather generally, how is it possible to preserve notions of agency and individuality while giving a stronger account of the interdependence of individuals? And second, how is it possible to give a universalist account that nonetheless recognizes varying historical and cultural understandings of human rights? Although these questions are too large to be adequately dealt with in the short frame of this essay, I will point to some directions for their resolution. First, my suggestion will be that an effective constructive account will need to operate with a more open and relational conception of agency than on existing views. And second, it will need to add a conception of what I have called *concrete universality* to the abstractly universal approaches to human rights that have been traditionally advanced as their foundation. The challenge in that connection is to develop a view that gives weight to social practices without making human rights relative to existing, and perhaps pernicious, practices. I suggest that what I have called a "quasi-foundational" social ontological (though not "metaphysical") perspective is best able to mediate between the various desiderata of agency and relationality, and between historicity and normativity. Although I will not be able to fully articulate this basis here, I hope to sketch some of its features as a springboard for further research.

## **II. Strongly Individualist Accounts of the Basis for Human Rights**

One theory that aims to provide a foundation for human rights is that of James Griffin in his *On Human Rights*. Griffin regards his approach as a "bottom up" one, inasmuch as it reflects on human rights as they are conceived in law and society and as they have historically come to be recognized since the Enlightenment. His theory articulates a conception of individual "personhood" as the justificatory core of the human rights idea, and he articulates this in terms of a conception of "normative agency," and as involving autonomy, liberty, and a minimum provision of goods necessary for such agency. The main notion is that persons are agents in having "a conception of a worthwhile life" (which is to be distinguished from having a single "plan of life"). In Griffin's terms, "what we attach value to, in this account of human rights, is specifically our capacity to choose and to pursue our conception of a worthwhile life."4 He regards such normative agency as typical of adult human beings, and stipulates that children are only potential agents in this sense, while some disabled adults lack even that potential. Thus human rights on his view pertain to normative agents in this rather restrictive sense. Griffin suggests that limiting human rights in this way avoids the indeterminateness that has afflicted alternative accounts of them, as well as their inflation in some recent discourse to cover the entire moral realm. Of course, children and disabled adults have other moral rights, but not human rights (though he acknowledges that children could also plausibly be held to have human rights, although he opts for the view that they lack them).5

<sup>5</sup> Griffin, *On Human Rights*, ch. 2.

There are several issues to focus on in Griffin's account. The most obvious one, though not the most central to the theme of this chapter, is his restriction of human rights to a subset of humans (in a way reminiscent of Kant's account of moral personhood). Griffin's exclusionary account strikes me as problematic, since it loses the very force of the notion of the human that makes human rights norms such powerful instruments of social and legal change worldwide (at least potentially, given that this power is far from fully actualized). While it is true that boundary and extension issues inevitably arise with notions of the human, it seems clear that human rights, in their root conception, should pertain to all and only humans. I think we need to take an inclusionary approach such the conception of human rights sees them as fundamentally applying to children and to adults with disabilities, and in short, to all humans from birth to death. It is beyond the scope of this essay to go into the issues surrounding who or what to call potential persons, but I think that Griffin goes astray in regarding children as only potential persons, rather than restricting this latter notion to embryos and fetuses. Even small babies display a sort of agency, though not the rich sense of normative agency that Griffin feels grounds human rights norms, in which such agents must have a "conception of a worthwhile life."

Significant for our purposes, here, is this high-level conception of personhood itself and the interpretation it gives of agency. Any account that builds a notion of "having a conception" into the basic idea of human agency is bound to exclude some humans. Having a conception of a good life is a fairly developed accomplishment. Moreover, the formulation itself seems distinctively liberal individualist in a way that is not obviously cross-cultural.

Yet, in some other important ways, Griffin's account is consonant with the one I gave of agency and human rights in my own *Rethinking Democracy* of 1988.6 I believe that a comparison of the approaches would be helpful to delineate some important similarities but also differences. My own view of agency and its conditions, I have claimed, is better able than Griffin's to support our attribution of human rights to all humans from birth to death, and also offers a more social account than Griffin's own, as well as one that is more open to the full range of human action and cultural expression. We can note that Griffin's emphasis on the high-level notion of normative agency does enable him to incorporate some of the richness and multiplicity of contemporary human rights norms, which more minimal accounts of agency open to all humans (for example, those emphasizing negative liberty) would seem not to support. Thus because Griffin's approach includes the conditions for people to pursue their conception of the good, it requires not only basic civil and political rights, but also rights to a level of welfare. However, I think there is a better way of keeping human rights open to all humans while at the same time making room for this multiplicity of human rights, including the more demanding ones included in the UDHR.7 In the course of the subsequent discussion here, I will point to that approach, elaborated in my previous work, including my *Globalizing Democracy and Human Rights* (2004). It

is an approach that distinguishes basic agency, taken in an open and inclusive sense, from the development or flourishing of this agency, but at the same time ties these two aspects of agency together. Such an account is able to support a useful distinction between basic and nonbasic (though still essential) human rights. I also suggest that this sort of approach enables us to accommodate the important emphasis on both freedom and dignity that pervades the international human rights documents.

My account of agency with its accompanying understanding of human rights is developed most fully in *Rethinking Democracy*, on the basis of a social ontology of what I call "individuals-in-relations," a conception I introduced originally in *Marx's Social Ontology*.8 This conception of agency appeals to a norm of positive freedom, interpreted in a different way from the notion of positive liberty that liberals like Isaiah Berlin were at pains to criticize. I distinguish a basic sense of agency characteristic of human beings, and consisting in intentionality or choice as a feature of human action, from the exercise of this agency in the development of capacities or the realization of long-term projects or goals. The first sense is not to be taken as restricted to purely conscious or conceptual activity but I suggest is evident in human life activity as a mode or way of being. I characterize the latter sense of agency in terms of a notion of self-development (or self-transformation, in more recent work), which can take both individual and collective forms, and emphasize that such self-transformation is a process that transpires over time. If we say that basic agency involves intentional action or choices, we can see that self-development presupposes this capacity for choosing. However, beyond this, a process of self-development (or "freedom to" and, in this sense, positive freedom) requires that choices be effective and involves also the cultivation of capacities. For this agency to be effective, a set of concrete conditions are needed, including both freedom from constraints on one's choices (including the negative liberties and also freedom from domination), as well as the positive availability of what I have called enabling conditions of action (both material and social).9 I have suggested that human rights specify these necessary conditions of action. Where these are conditions for any human life activity whatever (for example, security of the person, subsistence, and liberty), we have basic human rights, which presumably should have priority for fulfillment. Beyond this, the essential conditions for fuller flourishing or for self-development constitute the nonbasic, though still important, human rights.10

The distinctive advantage of this view, versus that of Griffin, is that the notion of basic agency is open and inclusive whereas his is exclusionary. Inasmuch as choice or intentionality is taken as characteristically human, it applies to humans as a class and thus can more easily support the universality necessary for an adequate conception of human rights. Nonetheless, the account here also emphasizes that this bare capacity of choice is insufficient without the conditions for its exercise. It articulates a richer conception of freedom as self-development or self-transformation of persons (including

the development of capacities and realization of goals), understood as a "normative imperative" posited in free human activity at the more basic level. Griffin, by contrast, is forced to introduce a single, high-level, notion of personhood as the justification for human rights, inasmuch as he sees that many of those rights are rather demanding and involve a complex exercise of capacities. Unfortunately, as we have indicated, Griffin is thereby forced to exclude a large number of humans from having human rights, including not only infants, but also children, as well as many people with disabilities. My account, by contrast, takes the basic conception of human agency as what we recognize when we say that human beings have human rights, but also holds that such agency must be cultivated or elaborated in the course of our lives, which requires a substantial set of conditions.11 Unlike in Berlin's account, however, these conditions are not just externally necessary for the achievement of freedom, but are integral to this overall conception of positive freedom itself, since human action always operates on such conditions, or takes place within them.

As I have indicated, among these conditions are social requirements of freedom from domination and oppression, as well as the need for recognition and the provision of care, welfare, and education over the course of a life. Thus the account here is able to make room for both traditional civil and political rights, and the newer social, economic, and cultural rights. The requirement for people to be free from constraint supports both liberty and non-domination, while the broader emphasis on freedom in the positive sense goes beyond security of the person as customarily understood to encompass also the newer requirements for what has been called human security. We can suggest too, but without elaborating it here, that these human rights can be construed as conditions for dignity as well, given the close connection between the notion of agency, taken as free in the twofold sense discussed here (namely freedom as the capacity of choice and its development in forms of flourishing) and the understanding of dignity in the human rights documents. The latter goes beyond respect for purposes to an appreciation of the conditions that make people's lives bearable and indeed potentially flourishing.

It is worth noting as well that the distinction between conditions necessary for human life activity in an ongoing manner and those required for its flourishing, including in diverse social and political contexts, helps to clarify how basic human rights apply to all humans in roughly similar ways, while political and social rights can reasonably take more specific forms (as they do in the international documents) and also can vary to a degree in their application in diverse forms of social and cultural organization. Taking human rights to include both primary (basic) and secondary (nonbasic) rights has the further advantage of retaining the highest urgency for the protection and provision of the basic conditions for life and liberty, while also including among the human rights themselves certain important conditions that are often relegated to optional status as merely civil matters, to be decided by particular nation-states. In this way, this approach explicitly seeks to push human rights theory

<sup>11</sup> While Griffin is able to recognize a number of demanding human rights as well (though not all of them in the UDHR), my suggestion here has been that he is able to do so so only by positing an overly restrictive basis for human rights, in his account of personhood.

and practice to go beyond a minimalist account and to devise ways of institutionalizing the richer set of rights pointed to in the UDHR and other documents. Yet, the distinction between most urgent rights and other of the human rights also suggests how their fulfillment can proceed in a practicable and effective way.

The central understanding of individuals as interdependent proposed in this approach, that is, understood as individuals-in-relations, leads not only to differences in what are taken to be human rights (that is, in the list of such rights), but also affects the basic justification that can be given of human rights, which here appeals to a norm of equal freedom and the conditions needed for making freedom effective. In this proposed approach to justification, we can see a distinction not only from Griffin's theory, but also from that of Alan Gewirth, to whose approach the view here is similar in some ways (particularly in interpreting rights in terms of the necessary conditions for agency).

In his influential approach to justifying human rights, as presented in his *The Community of Rights* and elsewhere, Gewirth formulates an argument for human rights as moral rights to freedom and well-being, which he thinks each agent must recognize in others on pain of logical inconsistency. Without reviewing the argument in detail, or the various criticisms that have been advanced against it, we can note that Gewirth operates with a conception of people as "prospective purposive agents" who act for goals that they regard as good.12 He holds that they must claim for themselves freedom and well-being as necessary conditions of their action. Gewirth further argues that this "must" supports a claim on the part of agents to their having a right to these conditions. Beginning from this prudential perspective of a single agent, Gewirth believes that we can universalize this claiming in that it is a matter of logical consistency that any other agent, similar in all relevant respects, would equally require these conditions. Gewirth suggests that this universalization yields a moral perspective in which all other human beings also have rights to freedom or well-being, as human rights.

Gewirth tends to think that these rights do not apply to infants or to people who are severely cognitively disabled, which is a problem for his view. Although his account of purposive activity is somewhat less demanding than Griffin's, it nonetheless is more robust than the emphasis on choice or intentional activity as a basis for universal recognition that I suggest. But apart from this, the justification Gewirth offers differs at crucial points from the one I would give. Gewirth has been criticized especially for the transition he makes from "must" in the prudential perspective of the agent in which the agent must (ie, needs to) have freedom and well-being as conditions to the idea that the agent has rights to these conditions in that it is not permissible for others (seemingly a different sense of must) to interfere or that they have duties not to interfere.13 Equally problematic for my purposes is Gewirth's move from the prudential to the moral perspective. That is, universalizing my claiming freedom and well-being as

rights might only amount to the idea that I recognize that others will likewise claim freedom and well-being, but not yet amount to their having a right to those conditions of action.14

The account I gave in *Rethinking Democracy* proceeds rather differently. It argues that the moral perspective requires a stronger and pre-existing commitment to the sociality of individuals if the requisite rights are to be generated. It proposes not only that people are agential in the open sense specified earlier but also that they are fundamentally interdependent. The social ontology of individuals-in-relations sees these relations as constitutive of individuals in the sense that they become who they are in and through these relations, to put it in quasi-Hegelian terms. But it crucially differs from holistic social accounts, in which individuals are wholly constituted by their relations or by the community of which they are a part, inasmuch as I locate the power of change as arising from individuals as agents. That is, individuals remain capable of choosing and changing their relations (though often only through collective rather than individual action), but are then formed or constituted by these relations (as well as by previous ones).

In my view, the process of recognizing other human beings as basic agents (ie, recognizing them as manifesting intentional activity) is already a feature of everyday experience. It is evident, for example, in the reciprocity of greetings ("Hello, how are you?" "I'm fine thanks, how are you?") and in such elementary experiences as avoiding bumping into each other on the street (by meeting the other's glance and moving in an appropriate direction), which Goffman called "vehicular interaction." It is also evident in the reciprocity of discourse, as Habermas has emphasized. The basic forms of equality and reciprocity posited in these customary and practical (and most often embodied) interactions, whether verbal or not, are elaborated in other forms of reciprocity, including widespread instrumental ones (for example, "tit for tat," or exchange for mutual benefit), along with more robust social forms of reciprocal respect and the reciprocity involved in group action oriented to shared goals, and ultimately in forms of genuinely mutual aid.15 I suggest that such stronger forms of recognition of others as equals are previsioned in the elementary practices of everyday life, which involve reciprocally regarding others as agents, at least in the basic sense, that is, as choosers who manifest intentionality in their life activity (but who do so in diverse ways).

Needless to say, elementary experience can also include forms of misrecognition, in which denigrating views of others are often built into our ordinary interactions as well. Thus it is certainly possible to internalize and to manifest attitudes that stereotypically downgrade others or display oppressive attitudes of other sorts. In extreme cases, we can almost convince ourselves that the others are no better than animals or things to dispose of, or more weakly and commonly, are simply instrumental to our purposes. So I do not wish to imply that ordinary experience

Gould, "Beyond Causality in the Social Sciences: Reciprocity as a Model of Non-Exploitative Social Relations," in *Epistemology, Methodology and the Social Sciences: Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science*, Vol. 71, ed.

is fully egalitarian by any means. Actual relations of oppression and domination can inform that experience and our modes of perception so that we grasp others as lesser, in very immediate and almost automatic ways. However, it seems to me that the basic idea of recognizing the other as a human being is evident in germ despite that fact. As Hegel early observed in his master–servitude account along somewhat similar lines, the master cannot succeed in subordinating others whom he regards as not fully human in a way that is satisfying (precisely because in their subjugated state they are regarded as lesser and unworthy, and thus incapable of fully recognizing the master as free).16

However, beyond the basic recognition of others in ordinary experience, we can come to see that the choice or intentional activity that grounds it is insufficient or ineffective without access to the conditions that support the development of people's various capacities and the realization of longer-term goals, as well as the cultivation of relationships (what I have called positive freedom). Taken without these conditions, choice remains bare or abstract, without consequence. This recognition of the importance of the conditions for effective freedom is not just a rational matter. Instead, in virtue of our interdependence and embodiment, we each necessarily and *ab initio* make social claims on others for the fulfillment of these conditions. As noted, these conditions include recognition itself (and freedom from domination), care, and education, as well as material conditions such as adequate food, shelter, and the means of work. Although the argument would be more complicated, I would suggest that the social claiming could be extended to the ability to participate in matters that concern groups or collectivities and ultimately to political decision making itself.

But what supports the validity of these claims that we make on each other, ie, their moral status as valid claims or rights? My suggestion is that we cannot get to this dimension of rightness by supposing that we reason from what we need as individuals with specific goals at which we aim to what others similarly situated need (seemingly involving an argument by analogy), along Gewirthian lines. This would yield only the observation that others make similar claims rather than that they have valid claims, although the recognition of equal status implied in that argument is an important feature of it and needs to be retained. Moreover, the Gewirthian argument appears to mistakenly suppose that the individual's interests and goals, as well as the conditions for action can be identified in this elaborated form prior to the recognition of other individuals, whereas in fact the individual in this strong sense (which goes beyond bare choice and intentionality) is already socially constituted. Instead, I think we recognize the basic agential power in others, which is equally characteristic of each of them. Beyond basic agency, we can come to recognize that the agency of each is

<sup>16</sup> G.W.F. Hegel, *Phenomenology of Spirit*, trans. A.V. Miller (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1977), 111–19 ("Independence and Dependence of Self-Consciousness: Lordship and Bondage"). For Hegel, the achievement of mutual rather than one-sided recognition was a product of a historical development. In the account in this essay, reciprocal recognition is understood as posited in germ in certain everyday practices, though it remains far from a robust recognition of each as free and is consistent with the prevalence of forms of domination.

inadequate without access to conditions and without the elaboration of social support through systems of mutual aid that we all need and that shape us, whether in particularistic or more universal ways.

The argument for equally valid claims here, ie, prima facie equal rights of access to the conditions (following Feinberg's account of rights as valid claims) therefore involves several features beyond those appealed to in Gewirth's account: (1) the idea that our experience as agents is already normative, that is, endowed with values and value endowing. More precisely, on my view this agential power is a source of value and this agency also affirms itself as valuable in the process of self-transformation or self-development. In this sense, the social ontology pointed to here is already normative. But (2) this creative and valuing agency is also interactive and socially constituted. It is essentially open to others and expresses our need for and dependence on each other. Such interdependence and mutual neediness involve elements of both inter-constitution through processes of recognition and the necessity for collective rather than only individual action for the realization of many aims and goals. (3) The everyday recognition of basic agency as free and thus as equal in a minimal sense is the germ of the elaborated recognition that each must not be dominated or oppressed, if their capacities are to be developed, their goals realized, and their relationships allowed to flourish. Such freedom from domination and the positive freedom to transform ourselves (individually or in common activity with others) involve claims we make on each other both for recognition of our agency and for the positive provision of means of action. (4) Given the importance not only of interdependence but also embodiment, a set of such means or conditions of action, including basic life and liberty and extending to means of subsistence and other social and economic factors, are needed by each and realizable only jointly.

From these various presuppositions, then, we can see that people can be said to make not only claims but also valid claims on others for the fulfillment of the basic conditions of action. This follows from the normative fact of their equal (basic) agency and from the deep features of mutual neediness and embodiment. In contexts in which there is a need to recognize and adjudicate among the various claims that each makes on others, we can recognize that no one has more of a claim on these conditions for action than any other (by virtue of the equality of their basic agency ingredient in their human status) and they each need to be free from domination for self-transformation (individually or collectively). Their sociality signifies that they necessarily depend on each other and are inter-constituting, such that their agency is what it is only in a social context of cooperation (whether implicit or explicit). Inasmuch as they are equally agents, where this agency is valuable and where it operates necessarily through structures of interdependence, no one has a right to dominate others and they equally require access to the conditions of self-transformation, material and social. The value of access to the conditions arises from the value of the free agency as such, which though recognized in germ, that is, in its basic forms, necessarily aims at further transformation and development by way of institutional structures of interdependence (and especially economic and political institutions, at least in modern forms of society), as well as particularistic

#### *Carol C. Gould* 187

forms of care.17 In my view, while the features of agency and interdependence are given in the basic structure of experience and obtain elemental recognition there, in order that these features can come to be widely acknowledged to extend to the broad requirements of universal human rights, historical processes of development are required.

For the various reasons just given, the normativity of equal claims such as is involved in human rights as moral and ultimately as legal rights cannot therefore be derived simply from a first person perspective coupled with a process of reasoning about its universality, as in Gewirth's account. Rather it only seems to be derivable in this way if we abstract from the feature of interdependence, which, like that of free activity, is a fundamental aspect of human action and interaction. Recognizing interdependence, however, does not mean that the power of agency, evident in ordinary experience and developed over time, can be reduced to any particular set of social relations; rather, it is also capable of transforming the very conditions of agency—material and social—though often only jointly with others. (Of course, this is not to say that this transformation is bound to occur, only that it is a possibility or potentiality of human action.) We can observe too that reason plays a role in this recognition of the equal agency of each, as Gewirth emphasizes, but that empathy and solidarity are also important, both as aspects of such processes of recognition, and in the emergence and development of individuality itself.

On the view presented here, then, the equality of agents can be seen to be the reverse side of the critique of domination or oppression. In order to be able to criticize the latter forms, we need the recognition of the value of agency and of its status as a characteristic feature of humans. I have suggested that when human activity is seen as free human activity, as presupposing both intentionality and its elaboration in processes of capacity formation, realizing individual and collective ends, and cultivating relationships, we can find a basis for the critique of misrecognition and of one-sided forms of recognition. However, such equal agency has hardly been overtly acknowledged in any more than the barest and implicit forms. Even in contemporary societies, there is regrettably considerably more oppression, domination, or exploitation, than equal treatment or reciprocal recognition of agency. This raises for us the need to articulate how the relevant human rights norms are related to social and historical practices, and to further develop the social aspects of human rights and more generally the ways they can be said to be relational.

## **III. Social and Practice-oriented Conceptions of Human Rights**

I would like now to briefly turn to the more social account of human rights found in Jürgen Habermas and to the practice-oriented one advanced by Charles Beitz. I want

<sup>17</sup> Each recognizes the equality of the others implicitly in perceiving the other human being as a (minimal) agent. This recognition is itself mutual (though barely so), in the features noted in ordinary experience. On this basis, equality can come to be articulated more fully as a value. Thus it should not be framed as a matter of reasoning from one's own case where the fully formed individual agent already recognizes the need for the conditions of agency. It involves also a reflection on the reciprocity and recognition in ordinary experience as well as by seeing the other as an agent. It is grounded, however, in their actually being agents, that is, phenomenologically.

to consider some of the implications of their approaches for the question of the basis of human rights, as well as to take note of the differences of the account proposed here from theirs.

In Habermas's relatively late magnum opus, *Between Facts and Norms*, human rights are given an importance beyond that found in his earlier works.18 In a way that partly contrasts with the approach here, Habermas conceives of human rights as emerging in the sphere of law rather than morality. I propose instead that human rights as fundamental normative claims of each on others ground human rights as legal rights. But these are not moral rights in Habermas's sense, taken as strictly individualistic duties towards others. Rather, I want to interpret these basic claims in social terms, though still normative ones. In Habermas's conception, while law and politics are capable of being organized normatively in terms of the discourse principle, that legal–political sphere, as including both democracy and rights, is now understood as separate from the moral domain. For Habermas (at least in *Between Facts and Norms*), as in prevailing understandings of human rights, the classic rights of life, liberty, and property pertain to citizens within a democracy, and he sees these rights as coming into being along with popular sovereignty or political autonomy itself. Popular sovereignty, for Habermas, gives his core discourse principle a legally institutionalized form, which is at the same time the "logical genesis of rights."19 According to Habermas, "This system [of rights] should contain precisely the rights citizens must confer on one another if they want to legitimately regulate their interactions and life contexts by means of positive law." He refers to such rights as "conditions for a discursive exercise of political autonomy."20

In this way, for Habermas, human rights hold against nation-states, as in the classical models, though they presumably could be constitutionalized at supranational levels as well. On such an interpretation, however, it is not clear how they can gain a fully universalist dimension as rights of everyone worldwide, which seems to me to be a great strength of this concept, along with their resulting transnational critical dimension. Habermas indicates that the rights will to a degree be specific to each political community. While this allows for some helpful diversity of interpretation and application, it does not explain their transnational or fully cosmopolitan dimension. Clearly, Habermas is concerned to emphasize a postmetaphysical justification for rights, and to eschew any notion of them as natural, or even as necessarily founded in structural features of human action. But given their tie to legality and democracy in his view, it remains unclear what their basis or justification is beyond the requirement that they are required by formal and procedural principles of law and democratic discourse. Habermas's guidance is to say that they arise from "applying the discourse principle to the general right to liberties—a right constitutive of the legal form as such."21 Inasmuch as they accord with the discourse principle, these rights are understood to arise in a communicative and socially interactive context, and, as

he says, concomitantly with political autonomy, as two sides of the same coin, so to speak. His account is thus a social one, but one in which rights are taken as emerging in post-conventional legal contexts, and pertaining primarily to nation-states. Aside from not doing justice to the cosmopolitan appeal of human rights, this view cannot account for the urgent need to fulfill human rights precisely where states are weakest or even absent.22

Like many other theorists, Habermas understands human rights as primarily civil and political rights, which is not surprising given that he sees human rights as tied to political democracy and political autonomy. Partly as a consequence, his view treats economic and social rights as secondary, and they come in as conditions for effective political democracy. This reflects a common, though I think mistaken, view of social and economic rights, as required for the sake of political equality, rather than for fulfilling basic human needs. It is partly to accommodate the latter requirement, now recognized in many countries worldwide, that I think we have to introduce a more general and fundamental conception of human rights.

The sociality of Habermas's view more generally, arises primarily from the way it connects law to the Discourse principle, that is, the principle that "[j]ust those action norms are valid to which all possibly affected persons could agree as participants in rational discourses."23 What human rights norms protect are both liberties and political rights that are important to citizens within a democratic state and which they can discursively justify to each other, in a way required by their communicative freedom in that context. The conditions of discourse are expressed in historically changing forms, however, rather than being understood as protections of fundamental agency, taken apart from or prior to or other than this discursive context, which Habermas understands here as a specifically legal one. In this way, Habermas's view contrasts with the standard liberal view, which presupposes individual agency as fundamental.

With his emphasis on communication, whether understood in "quasi-transcendental" or in a wholly non-foundationalist fashion, Habermas's view is on the side of those who emphasize the justifications or rational arguments we can give each other to be fundamental.24 Indeed, Habermas seems to see the rights themselves as emerging in an historical context, and thus capable of a reconstructive account. This contrasts with an account of human rights as conditions for human life activity or agency and as involving centrally the fulfillment of needs, including bodily ones. Habermas's approach also privileges one dimension of social practice and interaction, namely communication and discourse, and delimits that to the legal and political domain. In contrast, I seek to build on more recent expanded interpretations of human rights as centrally including social and economic rights that address our embodied and relational existence. I see their basis not only in discourse, communication, and justification, but in the fundamental social claims we make on each other to cooperate to meet needs and common goals, as well as in our caring relations with each other. In such contexts, we

recognize each other as agents, but not only as individualized but as socially interconstituting, expressing our mutual dependence.

Despite its great strengths, then, a Habermassian account is limited in the ways described. I have elsewhere focused on the exclusionary aspects of a view that privileges discourse in this way, and have suggested difficult sorts of circularity that are evident in discursive approaches to justifying norms.25 An implication for human rights, however, is that the freedom and equality of participants in discourse (or politics) are not seen as independently required by their agency but as justified as conditions for discourse (and more specifically in the context of law). But it is then unsurprising that the norms that emerge in such discursive contexts would turn out to include the very freedom and equality already presupposed in discursive practices themselves.

An alternative practice-based account of human rights is advanced by Charles Beitz in his influential book *The Idea of Human Rights*.26 Without elaborating his theory here, we can note that at least relative to the moral individualist views considered earlier, his account is rather deflationary, and emphasizes the contemporary practice of human rights enunciation and protection in the context of international relations. Beitz presents a model of that practice, understanding human rights as the protection by nation-states of important human interests as a matter of international concern. The account articulates human rights in terms of the norms ingredient in that practice, with attention focused on the way human rights operate in that international domain, in a way that is consonant with Rawls' approach if not directly parallel to his. But there is also, perhaps inevitably, an appeal to notions of fundamental human interests, which we will presumably agree on cross-culturally, though Beitz seeks to distance himself from agreement views in the first part of his work, along with giving criticisms of what he terms naturalistic approaches that elaborate contemporary versions of natural rights theory.27

The restriction to contemporary international human rights practice lends the account specificity but also raises questions concerning whether such an approach can retain the important critical and normative edge of human rights as fully cosmopolitan norms. Beitz holds that these norms do preserve that edge, as is evident in his discussions of their role as calling for the elimination of global poverty and in requiring women's human rights. But I suggest that they do so for him by way of his tacit appeal to notions of fundamental interests and that this is comparable to such appeals in more foundational approaches to human rights. Moreover, the discussion sometimes seems simply to posit the priority of contemporary human rights practice and the norms ingredient in it, in a way similar to Rawls's notion that these are essential elements of global public reason, without constructive arguments as to why they should

be taken to have this priority. Certainly, Beitz gives a critique of what he calls naturalistic and agreement views, but it is not clear that the interpretation he gives of those are the strongest existing versions available, particularly of the foundationalist approaches.

In any case, I suggest that the account I propose here is not simply naturalistic in Beitz's terms and certainly does not follow natural rights theory per se. Rather, it aims to combine both given and social understandings of agency and interaction, and also assigns a role to practices, as well as to cross-cultural dialogue. Of course, the practices I draw on are more basic social ones, rather than simply those evident in current international relations and law. I believe that only such a view is capable of guiding the further development of human rights in a way that is relevant to the emerging regionalization in world politics, as well as to controlling the economic forces of globalization in democratic and rights-respecting ways. It remains unclear to me how an analysis of the norms of contemporary practice can have this sort of critical role (beyond holding those who have already subscribed to them to account for these norms). Moreover, it is not clear how, despite its strengths in modeling contemporary practice, such an account can escape a problematic historicism in regard to norms and be able to succeed in providing guidance for future development of either the human rights conception generally or more specific concepts of human rights that articulate features of fundamental human interests.

### **IV. The Universality of Human Rights**

I have questioned whether either of these social or practice-oriented conceptions is able to give sufficient weight to human rights as fundamental protections of individuals. We need an adequate basis for regarding human rights as more than contingent or relative to a given time and place. And we should have reason to expect that human rights will retain their importance even if states became transformed into less state-like entitles, such that these rights give us legitimate claims on others in a more cosmopolitan framework. Thus they cannot be only protections given by our citizenship or our political community, but more fundamentally call on us to devise institutions that may serve to realize them, whether those institutions take the form of states or not.

The question is, then, how an account can be adequately historical and attentive to divergent contexts of practice and the emergence of norms, without at the same time being historicist, such that these norms would be conceived as relative to time and place. As we have seen, this historicism can be a problem for views that place exclusive emphasis on practices, to the degree that they are limited to holding a given practice to the norms implicit in it. Alternatively, procedural approaches to norm discovery may covertly introduce those very norms or values into the process itself and thereby rather too easily achieve the universal range they aspire to. I have suggested that this problem can afflict counterfactual strategies that propose to rely on what people would agree to under ideal conditions, inasmuch as conditions of freedom and equality are implicitly built into these procedures from the beginning. In such cases, it is unsurprising that the same values of freedom and equality become aspects of the norms agreed to under such conditions.28

<sup>28</sup> See also Gould, *Globalizing Democracy and Human Rights*, ch. 1.

I have instead proposed an explicitly normative basis for human rights, understanding it as having two interrelated elements—(equal) agency and its elaboration or development, the first referring to a capacity serving as a condition for the second. While agency as a basic existential capacity or power is implicitly recognized in ordinary interaction, it does not merely exist to the degree that it is recognized. As a capacity for change and self-transformation, it is manifest in the intentionality of human action and in our concrete ways of being in the world. Yet, as inseparable from ongoing processes of human life activity, such agency is partly constituted by previous social relations, and by ongoing contexts of shared meanings and practices, which are appropriated and elaborated subsequently in new ways, through concrete responsive and collective relations with others. This agency-in-relations, moreover, develops over time, both in the life of an individual and of a collectivity or cultural group. As a capacity for freedom-in-interdependence with others, such agency may also come to be explicitly recognized in its normative importance in the course of historical development. Its more concrete elaboration in processes of capacity formation and realization of long-term projects can also come to be acknowledged as important aspects of really effective freedom.

The proposed approach, then, has a quasi-transcendental or indeed quasifoundationalist aspect in its reliance on a norm of equal agency (or more fully equal positive freedom). But the analysis also gives considerable weight to specific social relations as they emerge historically, and particularly the overcoming of relations of domination and exploitation, which in turn enable the fuller and more inclusive recognition of agency. The account thus differs from traditional liberal or transcendental ones in not supposing that agency even as a capacity or mode of being is complete *ab initio*. With historical accounts, it acknowledges the relevance of the method of rational reconstruction of the conditions of emergence of these broader and more universalistic capacities. But I suggest it is not helpful to construe this in terms of what people would counterfactually agree to under ideal circumstances, since the latter does not in my view carry sufficient normative weight, or else it simply tacitly presupposes these very norms of freedom and equality. Such counterfactual approaches are in one sense, then, not normative enough, while in another sense they are too normative. They are not normative enough if they are limited to making a kind of prediction about what people would agree to, or else they are too normative in tacitly appealing to the very norms that are supposed to emerge through the relevant processes of dialogue and discourse. The account given here can, I think, more adequately explain why people should agree to recognize the agency of others and correlatively their human rights, without simply embedding this recognition in processes of interaction or of historical development. Nonetheless, this should also not be taken as traditionally deontological, but is instead based on what I have characterized as an experientially-based normative social ontology.

In this perspective, human rights are emergent in regard to their explicit normative status but should not be reduced to, or seen as merely relative to, existing forms of social life, or to particular stages of social and historical development. The approach attempts to go beyond the abstract universalism of liberalism (or indeed of natural rights conceptions) while avoiding an excessive historicization by making use of the additional notion of *concrete universality*.29 This conception involves the notion that particular forms of social relations are not merely accidental to individuals as human agents. Instead, it sees individuals as in part constituted by these relations, whether egalitarian ones of reciprocal recognition, or else one-sided relations of oppression, domination or misrecognition. This concrete universality can be usefully tied to what Marx characterized as a historical process of cultivating a many-sided individuality, one that is multiply related to others within particular structurally important forms of relationships and institutions (particularly economic ones).30 For Marx in the *Grundrisse*, this is a matter of the emergence of a multi-dimensional personality, which is universal in the sense of being open to multiple and wide interactions and constituted by a plethora of such diverse interactions, which Marx sees as for the most part supplanting abstractly universal notions of the human. But while Marx at times conceives of the person simply as the node of a set of relations, in a way comparable to contemporary intersectional analyses, I think it is important to recognize that individuals have the power of agency, whether individually or more often jointly with others, such that they can (at least sometimes) change the conditions of their action, as well as in some ways their agency itself.

Thus, my own view departs from that of Marx in attempting to articulate more fully than he does the relation between an open conception of agency as characteristic of each individual and this universalizing multi-sidedness of persons and their relations, which develops over time. In Marx's trenchant analysis, such elaboration is facilitated by the emergence of a world market along with extensive trading relations, and by an economy that breaks down barriers, in the first instance through capitalist processes themselves. More generally, I think it useful to clarify the role of abstractly universal norms in the context of these constitutive social relations and to more fully consider how such concrete universality is related to those abstract norms. Clearly, the abstractly universal norms have an important critical dimension of their own in positing the equality and universality of individuals as a basis for assessing as deficient the one-sided relations of domination that prevent people from realizing their freedom. But the necessary supplement is a notion of the many-sidedness of the relations that makes it possible for people to become fully aware of these norms and to articulate their ramifications over time. (This many-sidedness can also be seen as part of the notion of positive freedom itself, to the extent that it is understood as a process of the development or flourishing of agency over time.)

The implication for understanding human rights is that they too need to be taken in their concrete elaborations and interpretations across cultures and contexts, and not only as abstractly universal norms. This elaboration involves not only discursive processes of articulating and agreeing to the norms but also concrete constructions of fuller realizations of it, on the ground as it were. This occurs through the cultivation of

<sup>29</sup> I introduced this concept, drawing on a notion of it in Hegel, in Carol C. Gould, "The Woman Question: Philosophy of Liberation and the Liberation of Philosophy," *The Philosophical Forum*, V(1–2) (Fall–Winter, 1973–74): 5–44, reprinted in *Women and Philosophy: Toward a Theory of Liberation*, ed. Carol C. Gould and Marx W. Wartofsky (New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1976). I subsequently discussed it at some length in Gould, *Globalizing Democracy and Human Rights*, ch. 2.

specific (many-sided) relationships, for example, of solidarity both within nations and across borders and also through institutional innovation and development. Thus the relevant universality of agency is recognized in germ but only implicitly in basic social practices of reciprocity and it comes to be explicitly acknowledged only as a result of a process of development that can take more inclusive forms over time (though there is no necessity to this). Wider interactions in practice actually serve to construct the conditions for these norms to come to be recognized as fully universal. So the process of this concrete and differentiated universalizing presupposes the form of agency and the implicit reciprocity which supports the abstractly universal norm but practical processes are also conditions for its coming to be recognized more fully as a norm. It is the openness and multi-sidedness of the agency itself and its differentiation that makes possible such norm recognition.

The notion of concrete universality also ties in with the account of sociality as discussed earlier in this chapter. The suggestion was that human rights have a double basis—(1) in agency, understood as a creative power of self-transformation, taken both in individualistic and social forms; and (2) in interdependence as constitutive of this agency, in that the choices and intentions operate in and through a set of given social conditions and relations. Thus, people are not understood as *using* social cooperation in order to meet independently identified goals and aims, but instead their action presupposes cooperative contexts and their self-understandings are already informed by interdependent relations with others. Power is still identified with agency—whether individual or collective—but the context and the form of the agency, as well as the conditions needed to realize projects and develop capacities, are all social. So the idea of human rights as claims potentially on everyone for supporting institutions that can fulfill them can be understood as an expression and generalization of this fundamental interdependence and of the basic claims that we make on each other for the realization of our needs. This is clear in the case of our early claims on those close to us, especially members of our own families, but there is no principled restriction of such social claims to that context. Yet, it would be impractical for all others, including those at a distance, to have to realize our particular needs (and we theirs) and it seems clear that no one can be expected to do so without the intermediation of institutions. Rather, I suggest that human rights are valid claims on others to work to create the institutions that will enable us and others to fulfill human rights. It is in the first place a claim on each other to create relevant structures that will function effectively to fulfill these rights, basic and (eventually) nonbasic.

#### **V. Human Rights and the Conditions for Agency**

I have suggested that human rights are justified in terms of their connection to (positive) freedom as a norm ingredient in agency and are understood as specifying the most salient conditions for such agency, including basic and nonbasic conditions. These conditions include both negative ones that require freedom from interference, as well as positive or enabling ones. In these ways, these rights are responsive to both embodiment and sociality, and also presuppose some form of political community with others.

Inasmuch as the agents in question are understood to exist substantially in nature and need to interact with it for their continued existence, economic human rights and especially the right to means of subsistence and to security of the person take on major importance. (Needless to say, to recognize the relevance of material needs in this way does not mean that these very needs are not also socially interpreted and constructed.) Other salient conditions for agency are given in the traditional liberal rights that protect individuals from interference by the government or other authorities. But the view here goes beyond such an emphasis on negative liberty or freedom from interference to call attention to the requirement of freedom from domination or exploitation, omitted from these traditional accounts. It also goes beyond all those negative freedoms to propose the importance of enabling conditions for effective freedom, for example, education, health care, welfare, rights to work, etc., themselves specified in other human rights.

To understand such rights as providing for the conditions for both basic and developed forms of agency is distinct from emphasizing the provision of primary goods or even of resources for goal fulfillment. In a way similar to capabilities approaches, the notion of conditions for action is understood in terms of a conception of development or effective freedom. But unlike some capabilities approaches, the relevant notion of equal positive freedom here eschews any lists of essential capabilities or of functionings. Instead, it makes room only for lists of human rights themselves, and even there it sees them as provisional. Although rights specify necessary conditions of agency, they nonetheless can be variably used and need to be understood in a way consistent with the open conception of freedom advocated earlier. Moreover, the list of human rights can be thought of as somewhat variable for different social and historical contexts, though the basic rights, as conditions for any human life activity whatever, are likely to be relatively stable through time, although subject to different interpretations and elaborations.

Since such lists of basic and nonbasic (though still important) human rights pertain to conditions rather than actual functionings or even exclusively to capabilities, they avoid essentialism as well as the potentially ideological aspect of lists. And although lists of capabilities have certainly proved helpful for assessing a country's (or society's) development, it is not plausible to claim that such lists are definitive for all human development through all time. Lists of human rights, by contrast, somewhat more modestly address not agency itself but its conditions, which can be variably used or appropriated. Thus, the role of ideological bias or one-sidedness is minimized, though probably not eliminated. Further, such lists of human rights are best understood as provisional and as articulated through cross-cultural dialogue. This does not undermine their fundamental character, however, since they are rooted in the features of agency, interdependence, and embodiment. Yet, as conditions, they go beyond abstract goods and resources, in gaining their significance from the uses that people can make of them (a feature also emphasized in capabilities and other positive freedom approaches). In this way, such human rights should be understood as speaking to our shared needs and our potentials for cultivating fuller freedom, both individually and collectively.
