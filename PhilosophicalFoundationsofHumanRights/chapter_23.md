## [The Right to Security](#page-8-9)

#### *Liora Lazarus*

### **Introduction**

<span id="page-437-0"></span>The right to security is enshrined in international human rights treaties and constitutions globally. In many of these provisions, the right is articulated alongside the right to liberty from the state. In others, the right is linked to freedom from violence or bodily invasion from non-state actors. These rights give rise to correlative duties which can at times appear diametrically opposed. One right calls for protection from the state, while the other calls for state protection. These opposing dimensions give rise to different philosophical justifications for why security ought to be regarded as a human right.

At first blush, both aspects of the right to security seem axiomatically a good thing. All people share the ambition to live free from fear of attack, loss of life, arbitrary arrest, detention or coercive interrogation. This chapter explores the theoretical arguments that support the recognition of that ambition as a right worthy of legal and moral protection. Section I identifies competing conceptions of security in the theories of Hobbes and Locke. Section II discusses the philosophical justifications for the right to security in the work of Blackstone, Shue, Fredman, Powell, and Ramsay. Section III exposes the problems associated with broad conceptions of security as a meta-right, and argues in favour of a specific and narrow conception of the right.

#### **I. Competing Conceptions of Security**

Before embarking on this analysis it is worth our setting out some key distinctions. There is a difference between recognizing the 'good' of security, and recognizing whether specific actions taken in its pursuit constitute a social good. There is also a difference between recognizing the social good of security, and deciding that we ought to recognize and protect an individual's right to security. Finally, there is a difference between recognizing a right to security in principle, and determining the scope of the correlative obligations it places upon states and the weight it holds relative to other rights.

What makes security a good? Loader and Walker argue that security is a '"thick" public good', a 'great civilizing force', and a 'necessary and virtuous component of the good society'.1 Their arguments are not without key antecedents, for Hobbes and Locke thought carefully about security too.

#### **A.╇ Hobbes and the primacy of peace**

Ever since Hobbes' *Leviathan*, security has been identified as the primary benefit of political community, and the good against which we trade off our natural liberty. The rationale of the Hobbesian state, and the foundation of its legitimacy, rest on its assurance of the security of its citizens. Hobbes' social contract is the route through which mankind averts the social conditions whereby 'every man is enemy to every man' and 'men live without other security'.2 In this condition of 'war', Hobbes was convinced that no civilization, no self-realization, nothing good about being human, could be achieved and life would be 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short'.3 Humanity's transition from a state of nature to a political community is thus motivated by the promise of security, which in turn provides conditions in which our lives can become meaningful, and culturally and socially expressive.

Little to dispute thus far. But Hobbes went on to give security such primacy that no one in his society can contest the power of the provider of peace: the sovereign power constituted by the mutual consent of those inside a commonwealth. Hobbes' social contract was a bargain between individuals to cede their liberty—or 'right to do every thing'—to the extent necessary to avoid war.4 In so doing, they agreed to afford the sovereign—which he referred to as the 'Mortal God'—unlimited power.5 Security, then, for Hobbes, was both the rationale for the existence of the state, and the justification for unlimited sovereign power over the subjects within it. The sovereign 'may use the strength and means of them all, as he shall think expedient, for their peace and common defence'.6

Hobbes drew a stark distinction between peace (or bare security) assured by the absolute power of the sovereign, and war where such power is limited, divided or infringed. Because individuals contract with one another to mutually obey the sovereign in return for security, the sovereign cannot be held to account for breach of that contract.7 The powers which constituted the 'essence of sovereignty' were indivisible.8 It mattered not whether sovereignty was vested in a monarch or a democratically elected power, but whether that power was capable of eliminating war and the threat of war between men in his society.

This concern for peace was by no means abstract. Writing at the end of the English Civil War, Hobbes was evidently motivated by an immediate and concrete concern with peace and security in his time. Making sovereign powers divisible, in the sense of constitutionally accountable, had been the route to failure in the past.9 While well aware that there would be complaints about the sovereign, Hobbes thought the good of security too valuable to be threatened by civil dispute. Individual grievances with the actions of the sovereign could never be compared with 'the miseries, and horrible calamities, that accompany a civil war; or that dissolute condition of masterless men, without subjection to laws, and a coercive power to tie their hands from rapine and

revenge'.10 Averting this condition was Hobbes' persuasive mission, as he was convinced that men were incapable of knowing what was in their own interests: 'for all men are by nature provided of notable multiplying glasses. . .but are destitute of those prospective glasses, (namely moral and civil science,) to see afar off the miseries that hang over them. . . '.11

But looking with our retrospective 'glasses' over the last three centuries, it is easier to disagree with Hobbes about what is in our interests. Hobbes' account is instructive insofar as it highlights the value of security and its intimate connection to political power. Further, his understanding of the way that the good of security allows human flourishing and social and cultural development is seminal. But the primacy Hobbes affords to the assurance of security, and the power he gives to the sovereign in its pursuit, is less persuasive, as he fails to appreciate how the state itself might pose a threat to individual security. Notwithstanding, Hobbes' recognition of the value of security as a prerequisite to the realization of other individual and social goods has echoes in contemporary justifications for security as a meta-right.

Hobbes' account is also instructive in another way. It is the paradigmatic example of the way that fear of war, and an immediate sense of insecurity, can forge an inextricable logic towards a security state. The immediacy of insecurity, and the strength of our fear of harm, can lead us to prioritize security at the cost of corroding other social goods. Centuries after Hobbes, liberals generally agree that security has to be balanced with other goods, and that its attainment at the expense of all liberty, and all capacity to challenge political power, is a step too far. So for liberals, some conceptions of security, and their resultant implications for the ordering of political life, can in themselves constitute the wrong kind of society or even the wrong kind of security.

#### **B.╇ Locke's conception of liberty as security**

It is imperative therefore to craft a conception of security that is good, not just for security's sake, but for the social arrangements that flow from its pursuit. For Locke, Hobbes' society threatened the security of citizens themselves. He believed that individuals were equal to each other in their enjoyment of their natural rights to life, liberty, and property, which he referred to collectively as 'property'. He also believed that individuals had in equal measure the natural right to 'self-preservation'. This right included each individual's executive power to punish and police invasions of their 'property'. While Locke agreed with Hobbes that 'Safety and Security' were the 'end for which [individuals] are in Society',12 he was clear that individuals yielded up their power to others on the 'express or tacit Trust, that it shall be employed for their good'.13

Unlike Hobbes' agreement between 'subjects' to cede their liberty to an unrestricted sovereign power, Locke's social contract imposed reciprocal obligations on the state which had to be liberty regarding. For Locke, the point of entering into a political community was precisely to optimize the enjoyment of one's liberty and property. In

<sup>13</sup> Locke, *Two Treatises of Government*, §171.

entering into society from the state of nature, men give up certain freedoms, but they do so 'only with an intention in every one the better to preserve himself his Liberty and Property', because 'no rational Creature can be supposed to change his condition with an intention to be worse.'14

Locke did not share Hobbes' view of the state of nature as a state of war, nor of the benefits of an absolute monarchy to preserve against such a condition. He brought sovereign power down from Hobbes' pedestal. Rather than viewing the sovereign as a 'mortal God',15 Locke argued that '*absolute Monarchs* are but Men' and favoured limits upon their power.16 In opposition to Hobbes, Locke viewed 'absolute power' as the greatest threat to the security of individuals. Absolute power was, in his view, both a declaration of war against the people and an act of enslavement. As a consequence, Locke argued, 'to be free from such force is the only security of my Preservation'17 and that the '*Freedom* from Absolute, Arbitrary Power, is so necessary to, and closely joined with a Man's Preservation, that he cannot part with it, but by what forfeits his Preservation and Life together'.18

For Locke the power vested in the state or Sovereign can therefore have no other 'end or measure . . .but to preserve the Members of that Society in their Lives, Liberties, and Possessions'.19 Where this end was not fulfilled, and where those in power 'endeavour to grasp themselves or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust they forfeit the power, the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty'.20

If arbitrary power constituted the greatest threat to the security and preservation of individuals, then its antithesis constituted the greatest source of security for Locke. This meant that power must be constrained by law. Locke called this 'security within the limits of law'. He argued that men simply 'would not quit the freedom of the State of Nature' if what they stood to gain was government subject to 'Absolute Arbitrary Power, or Governing without settled standing Laws'.21 Since the power of the government was 'only for the good of the Society', then 'so it ought to be exercised by established and promulgated Laws'.22 This would mean 'that both the People may know their Duty, and be safe and secure within the limits of the Law, and the Rulers too kept within their due bounds'.23

Locke's conception of security thus differed greatly from that of Hobbes. He agreed that security underpinned meaningful human existence, and constituted the object of civic or political community. However, Locke's ideal of security was a rich conception embedded in the enjoyment of basic rights to liberty, life, and property. It was the law's capacity to protect these rights and the law's limits on sovereign power that kept individuals 'safe and secure within the limits of the Law'.24 Thus, while Locke himself did not expressly articulate a right to security, his theory forms the foundation of a

liberal conception of the right to security grounded in the protection of liberty, life, and property.

Our choice between Hobbes and Locke therefore rests on a choice about the ordering of values in a good society. Either we believe, as Hobbes did, that peace (or bare security) was a value so important as to supersede other goods in a political community, or we believe, like Locke, that a rich conception of security is inseparable from the enjoyment of the liberties and property that is naturally ours to enjoy. Locke certainly found favour with political thinkers of his time. Benjamin Franklin echoed his sentiments in his famous words, 'they who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety'.25 But the balance between liberty and security remains a perennial debate in liberal theory, and is certainly no less contested now than it was in Locke's time. We shall see in section III that the choice of whether security or liberty 'comes first'26 is a key element of our understanding of what the right to security should protect, the weight it should hold relative to other rights, and whether we believe this right should constitute a meta-right—the right of rights.

## **II. The Right to Security**

The theories of Hobbes and Locke laid the foundations for our competing conceptions of security and the social ordering that is consequent upon its pursuit. But neither of them ever spoke explicitly about a right to security. Section II of this chapter explores the theories that explicitly develop such a right. Here we make the transition from theories identifying security as the rationale of political community and a valuable social good, to theories of security as an individual and subjective right. This transition was first made in Blackstone's *Commentaries on the Laws of England*.27

#### **A.╇ Blackstone and the right to personal security**

Blackstone was a jurist, and not a political philosopher like Hobbes or Locke. His *Commentaries* were a systematic treatise offering explanatory structure to the common law in the eighteenth century, and identifying rights and principles from existing legal doctrine. Like Hobbes and Locke, Blackstone identified security as the prize of entering into social and political community: 'for no man, that considers a moment, would wish to retain the absolute and uncontrolled power of doing whatever he pleases: the consequence of which is, that every other man would also have the same power; and then there would be no security to individuals in any of the enjoyments of life'.28

<sup>27</sup> William Blackstone, *Commentaries on the Laws of England* (1753) (hereinafter 'Blackstone's *Commentaries*').

<sup>28</sup> Blackstone's *Commentaries*, 125.

Blackstone identified a 'right to personal security' as the first of the three absolute and natural rights of man. He argued that the rights of man could be 'reduced to three principal or primary articles; the right of personal security, the right of personal liberty, and the right of private property'.29 By absolute rights, Blackstone meant those 'primary' rights which belong 'to persons merely in a state of nature, and which every man is entitled to enjoy, whether out of society or in it'.30 The law's primary goal was the enforcement and balancing of these rights: 'the first and primary end of human laws is to maintain and regulate these absolute rights of individuals'.31

Blackstone's right to personal security included rights to protection from the state as well as rights to resources. As the right to personal security protected natural life, the 'immediate donation of the great creator'32 it placed considerable restrictions on the state's use of capital punishment, which he viewed as a central limitation on an accountable state.33 Consequently, English law ensured that no that 'no man shall be put to death, without being brought to answer by due process of law'.34 Blackstone also saw the right to personal security as the source of the common law prohibition of murder, the basis of the right to 'necessary self defence' and the foundation of the prohibition of abortion.35 Interestingly, Blackstone also identified a legal right to the resources necessary to sustain life: 'the law not only regards life and member, and protects every man in the enjoyment of them, but also furnishes him with every thing necessary for their support. For there is no man so indigent or wretched, but he may demand a supply sufficient for all the necessities of life from the more opulent part of the community, by means of the several statutes enacted for the relief of the poor, of which in their proper places'.36

Blackstone's conception of the right to personal security went beyond protecting life. It also included protection against injury of 'those limbs and members that may be necessary to a man, in order to defend himself or annoy his enemy'.37 He went on to argue that the right to security included protection against insult or injury, as a 'person or body is also entitled, by the same natural right, to security from the corporal insults of menaces, assaults, beating, and wounding; though such insults amount not to destruction of life or member'.38 Finally, Blackstone believed the right to security prompted the law to protect against risks to health, and even damage to reputation. In his words the law protected 'the preservation of a man's health from such practices as may prejudice or annoy it, and. . .the security of his reputation or good name from the arts of detraction and slander'.39

Blackstone's right to security was the first extensive account of security as a personal and legal right vested in individuals. While Hobbes thought security was the primary rationale for the sacrifice of absolute liberty, his account was so inimical to the idea of personal or civic rights that the notion of a right to security did not feature. For Hobbes, security was the inverse of liberty. While Locke included the right to life

amongst his list of natural rights, he did not extend this into a broader right to personal security within a political community. Blackstone identified the right to security as a natural right expressed in the content of the law in his time. An important dimension of Blackstone's account of the right to personal security was his inclusion of the right to resources necessary to sustain life. This anticipated later accounts of the socio-economic aspects of security, and gives lie to the idea that civil and political rights were initially and exclusively conceived as constraints upon the state. Moreover, it is noteworthy that Blackstone gave the right to personal security a broader remit than mere protection of life, including in its remit the protection of health, reputation, and bodily integrity.

However, Blackstone's account offers little guidance on the balance between the absolute rights he views it as the law's job to regulate. While the balance between security and liberty is a continuing discussion in political theory, the issues are even sharper when we introduce the notion of a basic right to security. Rights bring with them immediate demands for indications of weight and of relative balance. They introduce correlative duties on the state to act in certain ways. Without clear guidance on where to place the right to security in the hierarchy of rights, states may face irreconcilable legal duties. So the definition of the right to security matters in more immediate ways than many philosophers realise. Blackstone presents a starting point in recognising the primacy of the right to security, and by setting it alongside in equal measure to liberty and property. But it is the thornier question of the relative balance between these rights with which section III of this chapter is concerned.

#### **B.╇ Shue and the basic right to security**

We skip now to the latter part of the twentieth century, when Henry Shue's book—*Basic Rights*—marked a turning point in Anglo–American rights theory. Shue viewed basic rights as specifying 'the line beneath which no one is to be allowed to sink', providing 'some minimal protection against utter helplessness to those too weak to protect themselves'.40 Rights are 'basic' if and when 'enjoyment of them is essential to the enjoyment of all other rights.'41 He took the instrumental view that 'whether a right is basic is independent of whether its enjoyment is also valuable in itself'.42

Like Blackstone, Shue identified security as one of the three basic rights, alongside 'liberty' and 'subsistence'. For Shue, security is therefore a right of utmost importance, a meta-right which acts as a precondition to the enjoyment of all other rights. This is a novel claim regarding the right to security. Unlike Blackstone, Shue does not draw the foundation of his argument from the moral claim that basic rights are intrinsic to our human nature, and basic because of their intrinsic value. Rather, Shue makes an instrumental and pre-conditional argument that security constitutes a basic right because the enjoyment of all other enumerated rights would be impossible without it. Indeed, for Shue security is a 'constituent part of the enjoyment of every other right'.43

<sup>40</sup> Henry Shue, *Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and US Foreign Policy*, 2nd edn. (Princeton University Press, 1996), 18.

<sup>41</sup> Shue, *Basic Rights*, 19. 42 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 20. 43 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 67.

Shue defines the right to security as the right 'not to be subjected to murder, torture, mayhem, rape or assault'.44 He argues that at the very least 'if there are any rights (basic or not basic) at all, there are basic rights to physical security'.45 This is because:

no one can fully enjoy any right that is supposedly protected by society if someone can credibly threaten him or her with murder, rape, beating, etc., when he or she tries to enjoy the alleged right. Such threats to physical security are among the most serious and—in much of the world—the most widespread hindrances to the enjoyment of any right. If any right is to be exercised except at great risk, physical security must be protected. In the absence of physical security people are unable to use any other rights that society may be said to be protecting without being liable to encounter many of the worst dangers they would encounter if society were not protecting the rights. A right to full physical security belongs, then, among the more basic rights—not because the enjoyment of it would be more satisfying to someone who was also enjoying a full range of other rights, but because its absence would leave available extremely effective means for others, including the government, to interfere with or prevent the actual exercise of any other rights that were supposedly protected. Regardless of whether the enjoyment of physical security is also desirable for its own sake, it is desirable as part of the enjoyment of every other right. No rights other than a right to physical security can in fact be enjoyed if a right to physical security is not protected. Being physically secure is a necessary condition for the exercise of any other right, and guaranteeing physical security must be part of guaranteeing anything else as a right.46

The scope of Shue's right to security is broad, not because the dangers against which it protects are necessarily diffuse, but because the duties that flow from it are potentially wide ranging. He enumerates three duties that correlate to the existence of a basic right to security:

- I. Duties not to eliminate a person's security—duties to *avoid* depriving.
- II. Duties to protect people against deprivation of security by other people—duties to *protect* from deprivation.
- III. Duties to provide for the security of those unable to provide their own—duties to *aid* the deprived.47

The state's correlative duties to act are a key insight into the scope of Shue's right to security. Without the state fulfilling these duties, the enjoyment of all other rights (of which security forms a constitutive part) is impossible.

Shue leaves unresolved the relationship between security and liberty, and the trade-offs that might have to be made between them. For Shue, in order for liberty to attain the same *basic* status as the rights to security and subsistence, it has to be constitutive of the enjoyment of other rights. In this constitutive sense, Shue sees a smaller role for liberty than he does for 'security' and 'subsistence'. While he argues that the basic rights to security, subsistence, and liberty are mutually dependent, he nevertheless admits 'that the dependence is not completely symmetrical: the enjoyment of rights

47 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 52.

<sup>44</sup> Shue, *Basic Rights*, 20. 45 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 21. 46 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 21–2.

to *every liberty* is dependent upon the enjoyment of security and subsistence, but the enjoyment of rights to security and rights to subsistence is dependent upon the enjoyment of *only some liberties*'.48 Consequently, Shue goes on to identify those aspects of liberty which constitute essential elements of the enjoyment of other rights: namely rights to participation and rights to freedom of movement.49 His account of liberty as a basic right is thus a thinner rendition of the kind of liberty Locke viewed as intrinsically valuable.

When viewed from the perspective of the correlative duties flowing from Shue's right to security, the right to liberty certainly appears more limited than the right to security. Shue is vague on the practical forms that the correlative duties might take. He is clearly aware of the coercive potential of duties to protect, and the deleterious effects that overblown coercive powers can have on society:

[R]eliance on duties to protect rather than duties to avoid would constitute heavy reliance on something like national police power rather than self-restraint by individuals. . . and would involve obvious disadvantages if—probably, especially if—the police power were adequate actually to enforce duties to avoid upon a generally reluctant society . . .What division of labor is established by one's account of duties between self-restraint and restraint by others, such as police forces, will obviously have an enormous effect upon the quality of life of those living in the social system in question.50

As a consequence, Shue suggests that the appropriate way to fulfil such protective duties is to build organizations and society in a way that encourages self-restraint, rather than bolstering the coercive duties of state agents over individuals. In this way, he hopes to mitigate against the risk of coercive overreach:

The duty to protect ought not to be understood only in terms of the maintenance of law-enforcement, regulatory, and other closely related agencies. A major and more constructive part of the duty to protect is the duty to design social institutions that do not exceed the capacity of individuals and organizations, including private and public corporations, to restrain themselves. Not only the kinds of acute threats of deprivation that police can prevent, but the kinds of chronic threats that require imaginative legislation and sometimes, long term planning fall under the duty to protect.51

Notwithstanding Shue's worthy intentions, section III argues that the potential for the state's coercive overreach is shaped by the environment in which the right to security—and its attendant duties—is articulated. States seeking to legitimate extensive security measures may draw on the notion of security as a basic right in more pernicious ways. Shue's account of broad state duties to mitigate threats to personal security, coupled with his thin conception of liberty, provides more ammunition to proponents of the security state than he might have anticipated.

51 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 62.

#### **C.╇ Fredman, Powell, and the capabilities approach**

Sandra Fredman's expansive conception of the right to security is grounded in her broader theory of socio-economic rights. She argues that 'protection against hunger, want and other material deprivations that threaten a person's existence are . . . as much part of the right to personal security as protection against assaults by the state or others'.52 Her emphasis is on the social aspect of the right, viewing it as 'arising directly from the need to co-operate'.53

Like Shue, Fredman identifies security as an essential prerequisite to the exercise of liberty. Liberty is conceived in the positive sense of 'autonomy and genuine freedom of choice, rather than freedom from interference'.54 Once we view autonomy in this way, Fredman argues that socio-economic 'constraints' on individual choice become the focus of 'the right to security from want'.55

Fredman comes to this conclusion via Sen and Nussbaum's theory of human agency.56 They believe that a human being must have certain 'capabilities' protected in order to allow them to actualise their autonomy and freedom of choice. Autonomy can thus only flourish when key social conditions are in place: 'economic opportunities, political liberties, social powers and the enabling conditions of good health, basic education, and the encouragement and cultivation of initiatives'.57 This requires a view of constraints that go beyond those associated with the 'tyrannical' or 'repressive state', to one that includes economic deprivation. For Fredman, freedom from economic deprivation is as essential to 'security' as freedom from 'state repression'.

Powell also relies on capabilities theory when addressing her conception of 'the right to security of person', but for different reasons and ends. She argues that 'security' is nothing more than a referent to the goods, attributes and things we want to secure and 'thus, [it] represents the endurance of certain valuable interests without threat'.58 For Powell, security is inherently a relational concept, and it requires a set of referents to give it meaningful content. As a consequence, one must ask the questions: (1) security for whom (an agent or patient), (2) security of what (the 'referent object' or an interest or value to be protected), (3) security against/from what (a risk or threat), and (4) who or what will provide protection.59

Security thus describes the relation between these four factors and derives its meaning, in any particular context, from them. Crucially, for Powell the 'referent object' of 'the right to security of person' is, without question, 'the person'. Hence, the meaning of the right will depend crucially on the meaning attributed to 'personhood': a concept

which itself invites normative discussion, and to which the attachment of the word 'security' adds little clarification.

Powell develops a theory of 'personhood' in order to give meaning to the right to security. Like Fredman, she invokes capabilities theory to identify the interests protected by the right. For Powell, a theory of the right to security which doesn't engage with material conditions risks being lopsided, and preferencing a particular political agenda. Hence:

[T]o not recognize capabilities as relevant to security of person amounts to retaining the bias in the policy agenda whereby freedom from fear is automatically privileged over freedom from want. In other words, not to recognize these issues as security issues only protects a limited part of what is essential to 'the person'. Conceptions of security of person, which assume a particular content (for example freedom from arbitrary detention or freedom from violence), import a bias into the analysis. These are the questions for legitimate political debate.60

Fredman and Powell's use of capabilities theory thus provides justification for both the positive and negative aspects of the right to security. They particularly emphasize the material provisions required to facilitate the development of capabilities. This echoes Blackstone's original conception of the right, where he identified the material context of the right. Section III will explain however that there are grounds for caution in deploying the right to security to support other concrete socio-economic rights such as the right to subsistence, food, health, and housing.

#### **D.╇ Ramsay, the right to security, and vulnerable autonomy**

Peter Ramsay offers the most recent formulation of a right to security, which he grounds in his broader theory of 'vulnerable autonomy'.61 He locates the right to security in the individual's subjective need to be free from the fear of crime, which itself is a precondition to the exercise of autonomy. For Ramsay, autonomy requires 'self-respect, self-esteem and self-trust', and these fragile preconditions demand protection as a matter of social justice. Drawing on Anderson and Honneth, and in a similar vein to capabilities theory, Ramsay argues that individuals depend on 'supportive and recognitional' social institutions to exercise their autonomy.62

One aspect of the citizen's sense of self-esteem is her experience of 'ontological security'—an individual's subjective sense of security.63 Ontological security is achieved through a reflexive process of mutual reassurance and trust between individuals.64

See also Peter Ramsay, 'The Theory of Vulnerable Autonomy and the Legitimacy of the Civil Preventative Order', London School of Economics Legal Studies Working Paper No. 1/2008.

Ramsay explains the preventive provisions of the criminal law as a consequence of a citizen's vulnerable autonomy and their duties of mutual reassurance. On this view, failure to reassure others justifies imposing liability through preventative criminal law means, such as Anti-Social Behaviour Orders and their successors. This is because the 'responsibility to protect the vulnerability of others is the reflex of those others' right to be free from the fear of crime, which is to say their *right to security*'.65

Ramsay argues not only that his conception of the right to security is implicit in mainstream political theories,66 but also that it is fundamental to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). Although the right appears only obliquely in Article 5 ECHR, Ramsay correctly notes that security constitutes a ground for legitimate rights limitations in a range of qualified Convention provisions. Hence, he argues that an 'individual has no cause for complaint if their human rights are interfered with when the interference is necessary to uphold another's right to security'. From this he derives the novel, and rather questionable, legal conclusion that 'the right to security is enforced by means of a liability for failure to reassure others, and this liability implies a positive obligation to be aware of what will cause others insecurity.67

Ramsay's broad-ranging theory seeks to provide a coherent normative foundation for the emerging paradigm of prevention within the criminal law. In his search for this underlying paradigm he develops the broadest possible conception of the right to security, stretching it to include subjective feelings of insecurity, and applying a rather unique interpretation of human rights law. Section III of this chapter takes issue with this conception and with Ramsay's argument for it to be 'legitimated in the language of human rights'.68

#### **III. Securitizing Rights**

This chapter has discussed the arguments supporting the moral and political claim to a human right to security. Blackstone views the right as the consequence of a social contract in which the state gives security to individuals in return for restrictions of their natural liberty. Shue sees the right as basic, as without it all other rights would be incapable of realization. Fredman draws on capabilities theory to justify the right as essential to the exercise of autonomy and self-realization. Powell uses capabilities theory to give content to the idea of personhood, which she views as the key interpretive stem of the right to security of person. Ramsay grounds the right to security in his theory of 'vulnerable autonomy' and an elaborate view of the ECHR. But Shue, Fredman, Powell, and Ramsay do not take sufficient account of the potential for the right to security to legitimate the state's coercive overreach. My own view, closer to Locke, is that the state's political and moral duty to secure individuals must always be clearly constrained. If there is a right to security correlative upon the state's broader duty of security, it must be balanced within a hierarchy of rights which places liberty, dignity, and equality firmly at its apex.

The remainder of this chapter thus explores how the right to security has been shaped in the practice of the law and contemporary politics. While Blackstone and Ramsay both identify legal material that 'regulates' or 'expresses' the right to security as they see it, there is little concrete discussion of a posited right to security that must operate and have meaning within the law. The final part of this chapter examines the legal material and political rhetoric on the right to security. It concludes with some reflections on the difficulties of aspiring to a meta-right to security.

#### **A.╇ The right to security in law**

Certain consequences flow when we transfer a moral claim to a legal claim. Legal claims engage a set of social institutions and institutional activities that have potentially far reaching effects. When courts afford remedies for violations of legal rights, a range of tangible institutional consequences follow. This institutional force gives the claim a different character in social life to the rhetorical statements of politicians or the well-reasoned arguments of philosophers.

Further, legal claims must be intelligible to those who invoke them, argue against, and adjudicate upon them. Human rights claims may not always meet the standard of formal specificity that some lawyers would like, but they must at least be capable of giving rise to plausible legal arguments. Citizens, lawyers, legislators, and others must be able to discern the scope of the right, what its weight is relative to other rights, what duties it gives rise to, and what interests are protected under the right.

A brief comparative examination suggests that the core legal meaning of the right to security is unsettled. This is despite textual similarity between some of the relevant provisions. In a number of these, the right is linked closely to 'liberty', or 'freedom', and often with 'life'. The 'security' and 'liberty' nexus is present in the constitutions of Canada, South Africa, and Hungary, as well as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the ECHR.69 In the South African Constitution and the Northern Irish Draft Bill of Human Rights, in contrast, the right is expressed as a 'positive' right and protects explicitly against threats to security or violence from non-state actors.70

These more recently drafted documents also express the ordering of the right in contrasting ways. The South African Constitution has a specific right to be 'free from violence whether from public or private sources.'71 It also uses the right to personal security as an overarching title for a cluster of other rights such as 'freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and the right to bodily and psychological integrity'.72 The Northern Irish Draft

<sup>69</sup> Article 5 ECHR states that 'everyone has the right to liberty and security of person'. Article 3 UDHR states 'Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person'. Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that 'everyone has the right to life, liberty, and security of the person'. Section 55(1) of the Constitution of Hungary declares that 'everyone has the right to freedom and personal security'. Section 12 of the South African Constitution provides that 'everyone has the right to freedom and security of the person'.

Bill articulates the right to security as a self-standing preambular principle: 'everyone has the right to live free from violence, fear, oppression and intimidation, with differences to be resolved through exclusively democratic means without the use of threat or force'. However, the right to be protected against violence is also expressly grounded in the 'right to dignity and physical integrity' under section 6 of the Draft Bill.

These legal provisions are subject to varying judicial interpretations even where they share similar wording.73 In Canada, the right to security is understood very broadly, to include 'personal autonomy', 'control over one's physical and psychological integrity' and 'basic human dignity'.74 In contrast, the European Court of Human Rights sees no additional role for the term 'security' in Article 5 ECHR beyond that which liberty already protects.75 Where the legal norms themselves are broadly and positively expressed, as in South Africa, the courts have taken a narrow and restrictive view of the specific positive obligations imposed on the state.76 The broadest conception of all may be that found in the United Nations World Summit notion of human security, encompassing a range of existing human rights including dignity, the right to subsistence, and freedom from fear.77 While this norm is non-justiciable, it has clear normative weight within the United Nations (UN), and has very recently been reaffirmed by the UN General Assembly.78 It is evidently influenced by the capabilities approach.

From this rather brief and sweeping legal summary it is evident that the right to security is now seen to protect dignity, equality, liberty, physical and psychological autonomy, freedom from fear and freedom from want. This extensive range of interests has prompted me to conclude previously that the 'right to security can be deployed to protect most things that we want in life'.79 The breadth and opacity of the right to security gives rise to rule of law concerns about clarity and transparency, but it also gives rise to another concern about the legal legitimation of coercive action by the state. Coercive state action looks very different when it is cast as the exercise of a correlative duty flowing from the right to security, and politicians are only too well aware of this.

#### **B.╇ The right to security in political rhetoric**

An analysis of the use of the term 'right to security' in global political rhetoric since 9/11 indicates that the right has become a popular means to legitimate security measures.80 The term is most frequently used regarding the Middle East and North Korea, and it is commonly engaged when justifying counter-terrorist measures or military invasion in the name of the war on terror.81 Most leading politicians will have engaged the term at some stage in one of these contexts. Importantly, politicians are claiming that the 'right to security' is 'the basic right on which all others are based'.82 They used this premise to argue that negative rights ought to be 'rebalanced' in favour of the right to security and to legitimate strong coercive measures. On only one occasion, out of the 400 examples examined, has a politician invoked the right to security in its negative sense as a 'right to security against the power of the state'.83 This growing tendency to invoke the right to security as a means to extend the state's coercive or military reach is a process I have previously called 'righting security'.

Politicians can hardly be blamed for picking up on this rhetoric, when the UN and a number of leading domestic courts are doing the same. They have found themselves inadvertently bolstered by strange bed fellows within the human rights and development community. Both of these communities have found the language of the right to security to be an effective means to shore up the interests they are most concerned to promote. In the face of the initial onslaught on rights that came with early counter-terror strategy for example, Amnesty International was quick to claim that 'the right to security is a basic human right'.84 Moreover, the development community has clearly been a key part of the human security movement, presumably because the animating purchase of the concept of security is more powerful than invoking the language of the rights to subsistence, food or health on their own.85

So in short, the broad and inclusive capabilities approach to the right to security, and other philosophers' arguments for the meta-right to security have become a staple of international institutions and NGOs. Why should we care if they deploy strategically effective language for increasing human happiness? The problem is that a subtle shift is taking place that may be more pernicious than any well-meaning human rights activist might recognize. This lies in the securitization of rights.

the right to security too broadly carries some unsettling implications. The problems are various, but the most urgent is a subtle transformation of the ordering of human rights. I term this process the 'securitization' of rights.

In order to explore these objections, we need to recapitulate the argument in favour of security as a basic right. For Shue, security is such a right because its enjoyment is the 'necessary condition' of the enjoyment of any other right.86 The right to security is thus the 'right to secure rights'.87 But when we think of this in terms of meaningful obligations that might be imposed on a duty-bearer, what does this actually amount to? These claims regarding a broad and meta-right to security can be reformulated as follows: the right to security gives rise to correlative duties for states to create the conditions in which objective risks of future threats which might reasonably cause subjective feelings of apprehension or insecurity, are minimized to a degree that allows the enjoyment of other rights.88 In other words, the right to security imposes a 'protective' duty on the state to anticipate and mitigate the risks that militate against the enjoyment of all other rights.

There is a range of objections to this broad conception of the right. Two of these are chiefly issues of legal practicality: indeterminability and redundancy. The remainder are broader normative concerns: the argument concerning the weakness of the precondition, and the risk of securitization.

The first objection—vagueness—raises classic rule of law concerns. A right conceived of in this way is simply too broad to be legally workable. This is not only because it lacks specificity as such, but rather because its substance is connected to perceptions of future risk which are notoriously opaque. Potentially, there is no end to the kinds of risks that would have to be averted. Equally, our definition says nothing about how foreseeable the risks have to be in order to establish a breach of the right. How much risk can we tolerate in order to exercise our other rights? There is as a consequence little plausible legal material in the statement that the right to security constitutes a meta-right. We would need far more clarification for this norm to be legally workable, and that is exactly what the courts have found themselves doing when they have to explain the specific obligations flowing from the right.

In any event, we might argue, the idea of a meta-right is nothing more than a rhetorical flourish. The meta-right merely duplicates other rights, or to put it another way, the component parts of the meta-right to security are made up of the enjoyment of other rights. Could it be that the meta-right to security is nothing more than an illusion or a hologram? Or perhaps it is not a thing (or a right) in itself? At the very least, there is no plausible reason to introduce a legally redundant norm. In this formulation at least, it serves little legal function.

At best then, conceptions of the legal right to security as a meta-right amount to rhetorical claims of the importance of security as a value or good. A right so conceived is either so indeterminate as to defy implementation, or simply redundant, adding nothing of substance to the exercise of other rights. The real 'meat' of the legal right therefore consists in the specific obligations and duties which the courts are forced to

<sup>88</sup> Lazarus, 'The Right to Security, 100.

develop when confronted with motherhood statements about security as a meta-right. Beyond the mere impracticality or redundancy of transposing a meta-conception of the right to security into a legal setting, however, there are deeper normative and practical reasons to resist this approach.

The first of these normative objections is pursued by Jeremy Waldron who questions whether security is always a necessary precondition to the exercise of all other rights. Because 'security is not an all-or-nothing matter, but a matter of more or less'89 it may be possible to exercise rights in conditions of insecurity. Certainly, this is the case in many fragile states today where citizens exercise a range of rights and freedoms in conditions of severely compromised security. It may even be that in more secure environments the same is true. I might exercise freedom of expression one day, and have my home burgled the next. This patchy experience of security doesn't always correlate to the negation of all human rights.

Waldron alerts us to a further risk that focusing on the precondition to the exercise of all rights might steer us away from the meaningful enjoyment of other rights. Because security is a 'voracious ideal',90 we might skew the balance between security and other important rights in damaging ways. Waldron highlights this problem of balance when security is viewed as the right from which all other rights flow.

Many people think we would be safer if we were to abandon some of our rights or at least cut back on some of our more aggressive claims about the extent and importance of our civil liberties. Or maybe the trade-off should go in the other direction. Many people think we should be a little braver and risk a bit more in the way of security to uphold our precious rights. After all, security is not the be-all and the end-all; our rights are what really matter. But this alternative line will not work if it turns out that our security is valuable, not just for its own sake, but for the sake of our rights. What if the enjoyment of our rights is possible only when we are already secure against various forms of violent attack? If rights are worth nothing without security, then the brave alternative that I alluded to is misconceived.91

This brings us to the core of the problem. Without a specific and distinctive conception of the right to security—one which has meaningful content and limits—we do not know what it is we are balancing. What we do know is that the amorphous right to security can be used to legitimate measures in political rhetoric that threaten the other rights that security is meant to be 'securing'. We must urgently delimit the right to security in the political imagination; otherwise, the other human rights which security is meant to be serving are under more threat than we might want to acknowledge.

This brings us to the final objection. The argument that security constitutes a meta-right overlooks the distinction between foundational rights (the value-based claim) and pre-conditional rights (a factual claim). To argue that a right is foundational is more than arguing that rights can be enjoyed only in certain factual circumstances. Rather, a foundational right provides the broader value from which more specific rights can be derived. When we say someone has the right to dignity and

<sup>90</sup> Waldron, 'Security as a Basic Right'. 91 Waldron, 'Security as a Basic Right', 166.

therefore they must not be tortured, we are making a value statement that we believe must be respected for basic human existence to be meaningful. This isn't a question of the factual conditions, but a question of the values which guide the way we live and treat others. But the pre-condition argument presented by Shue is not doing the same thing. His argument is self-admittedly instrumental. The intrinsic value of security is less important to him than the purpose it serves to the exercise of other rights.

The puzzle then is whether security represents a non-instrumental value in its own terms, as Fredman and Powell claim. Security might be foundational because of the intrinsic value of its enjoyment, and because of the value-based platform it provides for the derivation of other more specific rights. In my view this is unsuccessful because, as Powell herself argues, security is an empty vessel which only attains meaning through attachment to other goods and interests. Powell's attempt to resolve the opacity of the right to security by reference to the notion of personhood doesn't entirely resolve this problem.

One way of demonstrating my point is to imagine a world in which security is achieved but in which the values of dignity, equality, and liberty are absent. What other specific and distinctive rights would the right to security afford? While we could at least say that the absence of threat to life or limb would be valuable in and of itself, life would have very little meaning beyond the bare fact of survival. And in any event, we could arrive at the same place by protecting the right to life, without importing all sorts of other open-ended interests through the hazy concept of security.

My objections are not purely theoretical however, as the confusion between the instrumental and non-instrumental value of security risks securitizing other rights, particularly when we move beyond the pages of philosophical texts to popular and political rhetoric. Securitization, simply put, is a sociological term used to describe a 'speech act' which results in security becoming the prism through which more and more social issues and categories are viewed.92 Loader and Walker have shown convincingly that securitization occurs when security is 'elevated to an unhealthy hegemonic category and comes to mean the unreflexive, parochial and anxious cleaving to a security-driven conception of a risk free society'.93

When politicians argue, as they have, that 'the right to security, to the protection of life and liberty, is and should be the basic right on which all others are based' they are in effect performing a securitizing act. They mean something a lot less comforting than Shue, Fredman, Powell or Ramsay would like to believe. Rather, by subsuming liberty into security, we can observe a subtle reordering of the value of liberty relative to security. It is reminiscent of a claim far closer to Etzioni's proposition that 'security comes first'.94 But liberty means something different to the anxious avoidance of risk. If it is seen as the subset of the right to security, then it becomes a lot less adventurous. When security is its root, liberty risks being reduced to a single dimension—its complexity and richness removed. Liberty may even mean the right to take risks.95

<sup>95</sup> Mark Neoclaus, *Critique of Security* (Edinburgh University Press, 2008), 24f.

Perhaps the starkest way to emphasize the dangers of securitization therefore, is to promote a *right to insecurity*. As I have argued elsewhere,96 such a right could be used to protect a life of self-creation, the value of unknowns and surprises, the importance of improvization and innovation, and most importantly, of freedom. For if we are to live in a society where the right to security becomes the meta-right upon which we legitimate claims to all other social values, we will, inevitably undermine the freedom which we hold dear. The point, is 'with freedom comes risk and insecurity, it is a necessary concomitant of the liberal society'. 97 For those who think that arguing for a right to insecurity is frivolous at dangerous times like these, we ought at the very least to argue for restraint in the deployment of the right to security. If there is to be such a right, we must find a way to distinguish it sharply from the right to be secure.98

## **Conclusion**

If there is a right to security, it should be meaningful on its own terms: we cannot resolve its opacity by reference to personhood or capabilities or all other rights. The right to security should be distinctive: it ought to protect those essential interests which other rights cannot plausibly be interpreted to protect. The right to security should not detract or distract from other rights: if security constitutes such an essential element of all other rights, then let us secure those rights in the first instance, instead of deploying the language of security to arrive at their protection. The right to security needs to be specific: it should correlate to clear and meaningful obligations and duties, rather than empty rhetorical statements. The right to security must be narrow: a right that is meaningful in law, that cannot be so easily deployed to legitimate the state's coercive overreach in a politics of security.

In short, we need to examine far more closely why the right to security or 'human security' has become such an animating language in human rights discourse today. We need to reflect on the reason why organisations like the World Justice Project single this right out in their Rule of Law index, over all other rights.99 We need to understand why invoking the basic rights to dignity, equality, and liberty isn't quite enough to spur institutional and political action nowadays. Finally, we need to resist the tendency to deploy the right to security as the means through which all other human interests are protected. If we don't, we risk colluding in a subtle reordering of the hierarchy of rights.
