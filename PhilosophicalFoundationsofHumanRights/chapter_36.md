## Care and Human Rights: A Reply to Virginia Held

#### *Susan Mendus*

<span id="page-656-0"></span>Virginia Held begins her thoughtful and engaging chapter by drawing attention to the progress which human rights have made in the last half century.1 She quotes Joseph Raz's claim—'this is a good time for human rights'—and she notes that human rights are now taken 'very seriously not only by many theorists, but by activists pressing governments to improve all sorts of conditions, and by courts deciding cases'. 'Charges of human rights violations have weight' Held notes. They are taken seriously by governments around the world; they can 'cut reputations and influence, and actually affect actions and policies'. In short, human rights claims are very weighty and human rights violations are very serious.

However, despite these positive opening comments, Held is, in the end, doubtful about the value of human rights as a way of addressing the most serious and pressing problems of the modern world. She notes the fragility of our alleged progress, particularly in the area of social and economic (positive) rights, and asks 'how much is achieved by declaring that all persons have rights to adequate food and health care and security and education'.2 More generally, she is concerned that an emphasis on rights and justice may come at the expense of other moral approaches, and she suggests that 'a focus on the moral approaches of care would be suitable for dealing with many of the most serious problems facing the globe's inhabitants. They might' she says, 'supplement or strengthen or perhaps even be more effective than the approach of human rights'.3 So, despite her initial acknowledgement of the importance of human rights, Held is, in the end, deeply doubtful about their power to assist us. On the negative side, she wonders whether they can adequately respond to our most serious global problems and, on the positive side, she suggests that an adequate response to those problems may be found in the appeal to care.

Held's reservations about human rights seem to me to be both important and well-grounded. Indeed, there is a long tradition of philosophical scepticism about human rights, and Held's chapter is an eloquent contribution to that tradition. However, I am less convinced that the appropriate response to those concerns is to invoke the language of care. In this reply, therefore, I will try to indicate the reasons for and extent of my support for Held's concerns about rights, and I will then go on to offer some reasons for thinking that those concerns, important though they are, need

not (and should not) lead us to place undue emphasis on the concept of care. In short, and *pace* Held, I believe that the concept of care is of very limited use in dealing with the most significant and pressing problems of the modern world.

My paper is divided into three sections: in the first section I will outline what I take to be Held's main reservations about human rights. In section II, I will raise some queries about her position—in particular I will ask whether the motivational problems associated with rights might be addressed in ways other than by an appeal to care. Finally, in section III, I will offer some reasons for being cautious about deploying an ethic of care in the way Held suggests. First, however, some reservations about rights.

#### **I. Reservations about Rights**

Scepticism about human rights has a long and distinguished history. As long ago as 1843 both Jeremy Bentham, in *Anarchical Fallacies*, and Karl Marx, in *On the Jewish Question*, expressed grave doubts about such rights: Bentham denied that we have any reason to believe in the existence of them, and (notoriously) he referred to talk of them as 'nonsense, and nonsense upon stilts'.4 Karl Marx's scepticism, meanwhile, had a slightly different character. Marx's concern was not so much with the ontological status of human rights as with the moral values which they seemed to reflect. He wrote: 'none of the so-called rights of man goes beyond egoistic man, man as he is in civil society namely an individual withdrawn behind his private interests and whims and separated from the community'.5 Here, the question is not whether rights exist, but rather what moral attitude an appeal to them evinces. Either way, though, questions arise about the legitimacy and value of human rights, and the passing of time has done little to dispel the reservations expressed by these philosophers. Writing nearly 150 years after Bentham and Marx, Alasdair MacIntyre declared: 'There are no [human] rights and belief in them is one with belief in unicorns and witches',6 while Milan Kundera announced, frustratedly, 'the more the fight for human rights gains in popularity, the more it loses in concrete content, becoming a kind of universal stance of everyone towards everything, a kind of energy that turns all human desires into rights'.7

Running through these quotations we can see a variety of objections to, or reservations about, human rights. Some, like Bentham and MacIntyre, focus on the (allegedly dubious) ontological status of human rights; others, like Marx and Kundera, are more concerned with the moral values which talk of rights reflects or implies. Held's concerns seem to fall firmly into the latter category. She is not especially concerned about how we know that rights exist. Rather, her focus is on the extent to which we can expect an appeal to human rights to help us in our response to the very serious social, political and economic problems of the modern world and, more generally, she doubts whether the values which are implied by human rights are the ones which will

prove to be most efficacious in our struggle against these problems—problems such as inequality, poverty, and hunger. Held writes:

Millions and millions of persons in the world continue to die of hunger and preventable illnesses, to be crushed by poverty, felled by violence, and blocked by ignorance. "About half of all human beings live in severe poverty", Thomas Pogge reminds us, "and about a quarter live in extreme or life-threatening poverty...About one third of all human deaths, 18 million each year, are due to poverty-related causes". How much is achieved by declaring that all persons have rights to adequate food and health care and security and education is unclear. So much of what is needed cannot be best addressed by progress in the law and legal processes.8

In this quotation from Held's chapter we find, in fact, not one, but three distinct concerns about human rights. These are: first, a concern about the status and legitimacy of positive, as distinct from negative, rights; second, a motivational concern; and third, a concern about the significance of law and justice vis-a-vis morality more widely construed. I will discuss these reservations in turn, but before joining the ranks of human rights sceptics, it is perhaps worth reminding ourselves of some of the things which can be said in favour of rights, and some of the reasons why both philosophers and activists have been reluctant to abandon them.

## **A.╇ In defence of rights**

In his 1991 book, *Modern Political Thought*, Raymond Plant draws attention to the political power and importance of appeals to human rights. 'Fundamental human rights' he tells us 'are supposed to answer the question of how *any* human being ought to be treated and what kinds of actions can legitimately be enforced by the state to ensure that persons are treated in this proper manner'.9 Additionally, they 'serve to remind us that the boundaries of nations are not the boundaries of our moral concern'. So the fact that slavery, for example, was legally sanctioned in some states of the United States does not make it any less a violation of human rights, nor any less a matter of concern for the rest of us. In short, human rights are an expression of our views about how people—all people—*ought* to be treated independently of how they are in fact treated. They serve to set minimum standards by which all should abide and to provide a common framework within which all must operate.

In emphasizing this, one of Plant's main aims is to remind us that laws and governments do not stand above criticism, and the fact that something is sanctioned by the laws of a given society does not itself vindicate the practice. Additionally, in a world where culture, religion, and community are taken very seriously, and where there are frequent calls for the recognition of different cultural practices, appeals to human rights remind us that there are nonetheless limits to what can legitimately be endorsed in the name of culture or religion. So whatever doubts we may have about the power of an appeal to human rights, we should note that such rights can serve to remind us

<sup>8</sup> Held, 'Care and Human Rights', 624–5.

<sup>9</sup> Raymond Plant, *Modern Political Thought* (Oxford: Blackwell, 1991), 255.

that governments are not self-legitimizing, that not everything is culturally dependent, and that some values transcend the boundaries of nations, of cultures, and of religions.

Additionally, an appeal to human rights can serve to remind us of the importance of offering, not only *a* reason, but *the right* reason for taking a particular moral stance. In some of his very earliest writings, John Rawls pointed out that we should be wary of appealing to utilitarian arguments when opposing slavery because utilitarianism can furnish us with pragmatic reasons only, whereas our opposition to slavery is (or should be) principled. In his discussion of Rawls and Utilitarianism, Richard Arneson puts the point this way:

Perhaps the animating philosophical idea in *A Theory of Justice* is that utilitarianism does not take rights seriously, that not taking rights seriously is a grave defect, and so we need a theory of justice that better fits our core convictions about ways that people must not be treated. Slavery is morally wrong because it violates fundamental moral rights of the persons who are enslaved.10

And in similar vein Joel Feinberg, in 'The Nature and Value of Rights' notes that one of the most conspicuous defects of a world without rights is that it is also a world in which the notion of claiming has no place. To remove talk of rights is to remove the possibility of a claim against others, and the possibility of claiming is, says Feinberg, a significant factor in self-respect. Thus:

To have a right is to have a claim against someone whose recognition as valid is called for by some set of governing rules or moral principles. To have a *claim* in turn, is to have a case meriting consideration, that is, to have reasons or grounds that put one in a position to engage in performative and propositional claiming. The activity of claiming, finally, as much as any other thing, makes for self-respect and respect for others, [and] gives a sense to the notion of personal dignity.11

Taken together, these considerations suggest that, even though human rights have certainly not expunged the ills of inequality, hunger, and poverty, it may nonetheless be important to retain them in our analysis of the wrongs and shortcomings of our world. After all, if we are to provide solutions to our problems, we first need to be clear about the precise nature of those problems, and here human rights may be very significant.

I shall return to some of these points at the end of the paper. For now, however, I simply want to note that, even though Held is surely right to draw attention to the fact that 'progress' in human rights has not brought an end to inequality, poverty or hunger, she may nonetheless be premature in her suggestion that rights be supplemented by, or rejected in favour of, an appeal to care.

With these preliminary considerations in place, therefore, I now turn to the three reservations which Held expresses about human rights. To recall, these are: a reservation about the value of positive rights; a concern about motivation; and a query about the status and ubiquity of law and justice.

#### **B.╇ Positive rights**

In the quotation given earlier, Held tells us that it is unclear 'how much is achieved by declaring that all persons have rights to adequate food and health care and security and education'. In saying this, she could be saying one of several things: she could, for instance, be doubting whether an appeal to rights is doing any work above and beyond the simple statement that these people are suffering and that we ought to do something about it. If we know that millions of people go to bed hungry each night, and if we deplore that state of affairs, what do we add by insisting that they have a *right* to food? Or a *right* to education? Or a *right* to a decent standard of living? If this is Held's question, then it is a question about, so to speak, the 'value-added' of rights talk, and it is reminiscent of Milan Kundera's concern that rights talk rapidly becomes a 'kind of universal stance of everyone towards everything'.

However, another possibility is that Held is casting doubt on the appeal to so-called 'positive' rights. In the literature on rights, a distinction is often drawn between positive and negative rights, where negative rights are rights to be left alone, or rights not to be interfered with. Thus, a right to life, negatively construed, is a right not to be killed, and other people can respect my right to life in this sense simply by doing nothing.

However, negative rights have been thought to stand in need of supplementing, and this has led to an appeal to positive rights or, as they are sometimes known, social and economic rights. These rights are not simply rights to be left alone, but rights to be given what one needs. In the specific example of the right to life, they are rights to be provided with the food that is necessary to keep starvation at bay, or rights to be given the kind of education that will enable one to escape poverty and destitution, or rights to be provided with the medical care needed to ensure continued existence. Of course the problem with rights of this kind is that, unlike negative rights, they make heavy demands on other people and may even put others under conflicting and incompatible obligations. If my right to life is construed simply as a right not to be killed, then it is a very simple matter for others to respect that right. They may respect my right to life, and indeed the right to life of millions of people across the entire globe, simply by sitting at home and doing nothing. If, however, the right to life is a right to be given what is needed for continued existence, then that will be extremely demanding on others, who may even find that it is straightforwardly impossible to meet all the rights claims made by the poor. If this happens, then the question (Held's question) 'how much is achieved by declaring that all persons have rights to adequate food and health care and security and education?' may be a question about the gap between what is demanded and what is possible.

Either way, though, positive rights are problematic: on the first interpretation it is not clear what is gained by invoking rights, rather than simply saying that we ought to do more.12 And on the second interpretation, it *is* clear that an appeal to rights may be a demand to do what cannot (logically) be done.

<sup>12</sup> Of course, to say this is to presuppose a particular answer to the challenge set by Feinberg, Rawls, Arneson, and others. It is to suppose that the language of rights does not assist in the identification of the real wrong inherent in poverty, eg, or hunger.

## **C.╇ The motivational problem**

A second concern which Held expresses in the quotation given earlier, is a concern about the motivational power of human rights. Even if we suppose that it is (somehow) possible to satisfy all positive rights claims, there remains the fact that, in our world, people are inadequately motivated to do so, and it might therefore be thought that the real problem is not a problem about rights at all, but a problem about motivation.

This concern is very eloquently expressed by Thomas Pogge in his Introduction to *World Poverty and Human Rights*, where he asks two questions:

- 1.╇ How can severe poverty of half of humankind continue despite enormous economic and technological progress and despite the enlightened moral norms and values of our heavily dominant Western civilization? And
- 2.╇ Why do we citizens of affluent Western states not find it morally troubling, at least, that a world heavily dominated by us and our values gives such very deficient and inferior starting positions and opportunities to so many people?13

What troubles Pogge is the fact that we, in the affluent West, could do much to alleviate poverty and suffering, but we do very little, and it therefore seems likely that we are, at root, unconcerned about, or indifferent to, the plight of others and about their fate.

And similar anxieties are voiced by Samuel Scheffler when he writes:

The task of defending moderate cosmopolitanism should not be thought of as a narrowly philosophical undertaking. In other words, it is not just a matter of producing cogent arguments in support of some abstract formulation of the view. Instead, moderate cosmopolitanism about justice will be a compelling position only if it proves possible to devise human institutions, practices and ways of life that take seriously the equal worth of persons without undermining people's capacity to sustain their special loyalties and attachments.14

Both Pogge and Scheffler identify a motivational gap, and both see this gap as a major impediment to improving the lot of the poor. Held's concerns, as reflected in the passage quoted earlier, are very similar.

## **D.╇ Justice, law, and morality**

The third concern which Held expresses is the concern that there is more to morality than mere justice, and that it is a mistake to suppose that the most serious problems in our world will be solved by focusing on law and justice. She emphasizes this point

<sup>13</sup> Thomas Pogge, *World Poverty and Human Rights* (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2002), 3.

<sup>14</sup> Samuel Scheffler, 'Conceptions of Cosmopolitanism', in Samuel Scheffler, *Boundaries and Allegiances* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), 129.

a number of times in the earlier parts of her chapter, noting that 'not all that we do or want or think we ought to aim at can possibly be captured within the essentially legal notion of right or human right'.15 And again 'many of our most important relations are not legal ones except in the most peripheral sense approached by the misleading claim that law covers "everything" because whatever it does not forbid, it allows'.16 And finally, 'certainly legal rights to equal treatment are highly important, but in advancing equality much more than law is needed. Cultural change must precede and accompany and go beyond legal enactments of rights. The experience of the gay rights movement offers much evidence. So too with many human rights'.17 So her concern is that the focus on law and justice which is inherent in rights talk is a focus on the wrong kind of thing.

Taken together, Held's three concerns about human rights are: first, that where human rights are understood as positive rights (rights to receive support and not merely rights not to be interfered with), they are too demanding and not always simultaneously satisfiable; second, that talk of rights disguises, or deflects attention from, the real problem, which is our lack of motivation to help others; and third that the appeal to the language of rights and of justice supposes what is not true—namely, that we should look to the law for a resolution of our most serious problems.

As I noted at the outset, I share some of Held's concerns about human rights. In particular, I share her concern about the motivational problems associated with positive rights. She is surely correct to wonder what is gained by invoking rights in cases where we know that there is little if any motivation to take the actions which would secure the things which the rights dictate. As she pointedly asks, 'What is achieved by declaring that all people have rights to food and health care and security and education?' Since we know that in much of the world these things are not provided, the appeal to a right to them seems at best wishful thinking, at worst a culpable disregard for the realities of others' lives.

Nonetheless, there is a considerable gap between the acknowledgement of these problems about human rights and the move to a morality of care which Held urges upon us. We might agree that there are problems with an appeal to human rights while denying that the solution to those problems lies in a morality of care. This, indeed, is the argument I now wish to advance and my main focus will be on the shortcomings in the morality of care. So although I agree with Held that rights are problematic, I do not agree with her claim that care is the solution to the problem. My reasons for this will be given in the third, and final, section of the paper. First, however, some alternative responses to the problems with human rights.

#### **II. Human Rights and Motivation**

I have already noted the wide variety of ways in which and reasons for which rights have been thought to be problematic, and I have also noted that Held's concerns about rights centre on their alleged motivational shortcomings. She is not alone in noting these shortcomings. Over a long period of time Onora O'Neill has also expressed

- 17 Held, 'Care and Human Rights', 628.
<sup>15</sup> Held, 'Care and Human Rights', 627.â•…â•…â•…16 Held, 'Care and Human Rights', 628.

concern about the motivational power of appeals to human rights and has argued eloquently for the superiority of a theory of obligation over a theory of rights. Moreover, one of O'Neill's main reasons for invoking obligations rather than rights is that the latter are, as she puts it, motivationally inert. She writes:

Claims about rights need only assert what rights-holders are entitled to; only the curmudgeonly will object. Others may be animated and have their hopes raised. But claims about obligations have to specify not only what is to be accorded, but which obligation-bearers are going to have to do what for whom and at what cost. This is a much less charming topic. Unsurprisingly the rhetoric of obligations and duties has an unsavoury reputation, and those on whom burdens fall may often object.18

For O'Neill, the crucial question is not 'who has the rights?' but 'who is obliged to meet those rights?' Like Held, she is concerned about the motivational gap, but unlike Held she believes the best way of bridging it is by appealing to obligation, not by appealing to the morality of care. And her main reason for making this move is her conviction that a focus on obligations will draw attention to the need for claims to be met *by someone*, for rights to be recognized *by someone*, and for entitlements to be guaranteed *by someone*.

Of course, there may be disagreement about who exactly has these obligations, and in the most serious cases—cases of world poverty and inequality—the 'someone' on whom the obligation falls is likely to be a government rather than an individual. Where extensive poverty, suffering, and inequality are concerned, there is often very little individuals can do by themselves, and obligations must therefore fall upon governments or other institutional actors to ensure that appropriate and effective structures are in place to alleviate the suffering and reduce the inequalities. Nonetheless, the prioritization of obligations rather than rights highlights the fact that, in order to fill the gap between a claim of right and an action in fulfilment of that right, we need to identify who it is who is obligated, and of course this is especially true in the case of positive, or social and economic, rights. As O'Neill notes:

A violation of a right not to be raped or of a right not to be tortured may be clear enough, and the perpetrator may even be identifiable, even when the institutions for enforcement are lamentably weak. But the correspondence of universal rights to goods and services to obligations *to provide or deliver* remains entirely amorphous when institutions are missing or weak. Somebody who receives no maternity care may no doubt *assert* that her rights have been violated, but unless obligations to deliver that care have been established and distributed, she will not know where to press her claim, and it will be systematically obscure whether there is any perpetrator, or who has neglected or violated her rights.19

So the appeal to care is only one possible strategy open to those who are concerned about the motivational gap. There is also the possibility of an appeal to obligation. Why might this be thought preferable to an appeal to care? It is this question which I will address in the next, and final, section of the paper.

## **III. Concerns about Care**

I have already identified what I take to be Held's main reservations about rights, and I have noted that, even where we share these reservations, we should be cautious about moving directly to an endorsement of care. Care may not be the best response to the motivational problem inherent in rights, and it is certainly not the only response. But why should we be concerned about the move to a morality of care? What is the precise nature of that move and what are the problems inherent in it? In this, final, section I will focus on two problems with the morality of care, both of which are associated with the motivational gap which Held identifies in her critique of rights.

The first problem arises from the fact that an ethics of care is rooted in our experience of individual, personal relationships. Carol Gilligan's initial work on the ethics of care took its inspiration from differences in the ways men and women respond to small-scale, face-to-face situations. 'The moral imperative for women' Gilligan wrote 'is an injunction to care, a responsibility to discern and alleviate the "real and recognisable trouble" of this world. . .The standard of moral judgement that informs [women's] assessment of the self is a standard of relationship, an ethic of nurturance, responsibility and care'.20 And Held concurs with this understanding of the ethics of care when she writes: 'care is based especially on experience. Without care, no human person would survive into adulthood to become the rational individual of traditional moral theories. Every person has received care that has incorporated moral values, and every person can reflect on his or her experience of practices of care'.21 And again:

Attending to care and its practices brings to the fore such values as empathetic understanding, sensitivity to the needs of others and especially, responsiveness to such needs. It calls especially for trust between care givers and recipients, and for understanding the relations between them as much from the point of view of the recipient of care as of the provider.22

In short, it is actual relationships between actual people which inspire an ethics of care and which lend it its persuasive power. But there is a real question about whether and why we might expect the insights derived from these individual cases to transfer to the wider world and inform our responses to global issues of poverty, inequality, and hunger.

To see what is at stake here, consider two problems associated with the transition from the personal to the global. First, and as a number of commentators have pointed out, there are considerable psychological problems with the transition: the care we have for our friends and family is, by its nature, particular, and is not easily extended to unknown others, or to the wider world generally. Michael Ignatieff puts the point this way:

We recognize our humanity in our differences, in our individuality, our history, in the faithful discharge of our particular culture of obligation. There is no identity we

<sup>20</sup> Carol Gilligan, *In a Different Voice* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1982), 159–60.

<sup>21</sup> Held, 'Care and Human rights', 630.â•…â•…â•…22 Held, 'Care and Human Rights', 630.

can recognize in our universality. There is no such thing as love of the human race, only love of this person for that, in this time and not in any other.23

So it is not clear that the care which arises in individual, face-to-face relationships can (psychologically) be extended to unknown others, or to humanity as a whole.

Additionally, and even if care could be extended in this way, we might find that it is transformed in the process and becomes a vice rather than a virtue. The care which operates at the individual level and which is an admirable character trait may cease to be admirable if it is translated into a policy for society as a whole. To see how this may be, we need to focus less on the perspective of the carer, and more on the perspective of the recipient of care. Proponents of the ethics of care tend to focus their attention on those who provide care—on women as those who nurture, support, and provide succour to the needy and vulnerable.

All this is admirable, but it can take on a slightly different quality if viewed from the perspective of the recipient of care: to receive care and nurture from those whom we love is indeed highly desirable, but when the ethics of care is extended to society more widely it implies the provision of care to unknown others and, from their point of view, to be the recipient of care is, potentially, humiliating and degrading. Put simply, the care and compassion which we embrace at the individual level may become patronizing at the political level. Here, what is desired is not sympathy from those who are better off than ourselves, but rather a recognition of our claims of need as claims of justice, not as requests for compassion or sympathy. The substitution of compassion for justice at the political level was, in part, responsible for the some of the most morally disreputable aspects of Victorian Poor Law in England, and this should serve as a warning against unbridled enthusiasm for the extension of care to the wider political world.

This first concern—that the ethics of care may be transformed when applied to society as a whole—leads to a second, which is that a focus on care, far from supplementing considerations of justice, as Held hopes, may in fact drive them out and thus reduce what are properly claims of right to pleas for generosity. Indeed it is this possibility that informs Joel Feinberg's defence of rights, and his anxiety that a world in which there are no rights is a world in which there are no claims and therefore, ultimately, no dignity or self-respect. To recall, Feinberg writes:

To have a right is to have a claim against someone whose recognition as valid is called for by some set of governing rules or moral principles. To have a *claim* in turn, is to have a case meriting consideration, that is, to have reasons or grounds that put one in a position to engage in performative and propositional claiming. The activity of claiming, finally, as much as any other thing, makes for self-respect and respect for others, [and] gives a sense to the notion of personal dignity.24

So, despite its many advantages, the ethics of care does not speak to the importance of claiming and to its role in human dignity, since care, by definition, is not something to which we can lay claim. Moreover, the rejection of rights, and the claims that are a

<sup>23</sup> Michael Ignatieff, *The Needs of Strangers* (London: Hogarth, 1984), 42.

<sup>24</sup> Feinberg, 'The Nature and Value of Rights', 155.

concomitant of them, is a very dangerous strategy for women in particular. Many, if not most, of the achievements of early feminism were gained through appeals to rights and justice, so to reject or minimize these is to embark on a dangerous journey. Anne Phillips puts the point this way:

Compassion cannot substitute for the impartiality of justice and equality, for compassion is potentially limited to those we can understand—and hence those who are most like ourselves. For feminists, in particular, this would be a risky road to pursue, and it was precisely the demand for equality across seemingly impassable barriers of incomprehension and difference that gave birth to the feminist tradition.25

There are, then reasons for endorsing Held's critique of human rights and for sharing her concern about the motivational gap which exists between claims of rights and the actions required to meet those rights. However, her appeal to the ethics of care may be both premature and problematic: premature because there are other responses to the problem of motivation—notably, but not uniquely, Onora O'Neill's appeals to obligation; problematic because it is difficult to see how care can be extended to unknown others while retaining its character as a virtue rather than a vice, and also risky to relinquish the rights-based appeals which have done so much to improve the position of many people—including women—both politically and socially.

It would, however, be wrong to end on a negative note. Held's article is rich, engaging, and philosophically sophisticated. She sees many, if not all, the problems I have identified here and she tackles them with imagination and skill. My criticisms should therefore be read as different 'judgement calls' about the amount of weight we, as feminists, should accord to the claims of justice vis-a-vis the morality of care, and as a slightly less optimistic analysis of the political promise inherent in the ethics of care. Certainly they are not reasons to reject the ethics of care wholesale, nor are they reasons to forget the very significant contribution to moral theory which has been made by care theorists in general and by Virginia Held in particular. For this insightful and thought-provoking chapter, and for much else, we owe her our thanks.
