### **I. Justifying Human Rights**

On first consideration the project of devising a philosophical justification for human rights looks quite odd. Human rights have a specific and recent origin, and the schedule of rights declared in the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* of 1948 reflects the contingencies of that history. Those who framed the Declaration drew on earlier arguments for conceptions of natural rights and of the rights of man, but what they produced reflects a specific historical situation. The Declaration is a central part of the post-WWII settlement and the institutional structures it established. The rights declared were to be acknowledged by the accession of states to the United Nations, and later by their ratification of the more specific rights set out in the human rights Covenants of the late 1960s. It seems that the answer to the question "Why are human rights binding?" might be simply that the states of which we are citizens have agreed to them. This "justification" assumes the authority of states, and assumes that the relevant exercises of that authority have taken place. It brackets questions about any deeper normative justification of the standards that are set out in the human rights documents.

Nevertheless, the thought that human rights are no more than the assertions and standards of a particular historical moment, to which states have committed themselves (at least for the time being) is widely rejected. For better or for worse, human rights are seen as formulating valid moral claims that human beings can make on one another, and in particular on states and their institutions and officials, even (or especially) when existing institutional structures fail to protect or secure those claims. When the citizens of rogue states are tortured or imprisoned without trials or deprived of their livelihoods, nobody says in justification that those states have not signed up to human rights, or (a common situation) that they have signed up but taken no effective steps to secure or implement the standards to which they signed up. Human rights are typically seen as "moral rights possessed by all human beings simply in virtue of their humanity".* So like earlier proponents of natural rights or of the rights of man, the proponents of human rights face a deeper and more difficult justificatory task. John Tasioulas addresses this deeper task.

If human rights are standards that law and public policy *ought* to secure and enforce—if they are normative for state action and legislation—a demand for deeper justification is entirely reasonable. Accession and ratification do not provide deep justifications: rather they are the first (and *only* the first) steps towards implementation. If those steps were all that lies behind human rights, then human

rights would be on a par with other matters of international agreement or legal enactment, and could be rescinded or amended by subsequent international agreement or legislative enactment. Although there are those who try to suggest that any deeper justification is now otiose because human rights have been widely accepted, or because the more specific conventions on human rights of the late 1960s have been widely ratified by the states party, this strategy evades rather than meeting the demands of normative justification.

Tasioulas begins his rich discussion of the justification of human rights by characterising his aim as that of providing "foundations without foundationalism" (45–50). The point of this distinction is to maintain that justification is needed and not redundant, but not to assume that there is some specific type of foundational consideration that can justify all human rights claims. Tasioulas characterizes the justification that he offers as "a two-level pluralist account of the grounding of human rights, since it appeals to both moral (equal human dignity) and prudential (universal human interests) considerations, and it allows a plurality of human interests to play a grounding role" (70). His approach may seem unconvincing to those moral realists who take it that justification must fail unless it traces human rights back to basics of a single, canonical type. However, Tasioulas does not take such moral realists head on in this paper.

#### **II. Arguments for Plural Justification**

Much of the paper is devoted to showing that an adequate justification of human rights must appeal to a plurality of considerations, and in particular that it cannot rest solely on appeals to the importance of protecting human interests.

Tasioulas's discussion of the limitations of appeals to interests seems to me convincing. Although he accepts the idea that normative justifications, including justifications of rights, need to take serious account of human interests, he argues that appeals to human interests *on their own* would fail to secure the sort of "resistance to trade-offs" that is characteristic of rights (70). Rights cannot be "identified" with interests, even with basic interests, because "[h]uman interests—even our most urgent interests, such as the avoidance of imminent death—can be impaired or neglected in all sorts of ways without any wrong being committed, let alone one that has the character of a rights violation". This consideration tells not only against would-be justifications of rights that "identify" or equate them with interests, but against more guarded positions that seek to justify human rights solely as means to protect and realize (basic) human interests. Interests often go beyond rights: we may have an interest in acquiring another's possessions, or in being the object of another's romantic love, but rights to neither. And rights often go beyond interests: everyone may have rights to freedoms of speech or association, but some individuals may have little or no interest in either, for example if they lack capacities to communicate or to associate with others. More generally, the fact that the interests of a given person may not be wholly compossible, and that the interests of distinct persons are rarely if ever wholly compossible, are sufficient to show that interests constantly have to be traded off against one another. This indeed shows that *by*  *themselves* interests cannot offer a plausible grounding for rights, where trade-offs are generally suspect.

### **III. From Rights to Duties**

But if interests alone cannot justify human rights, what are the alternatives? Should human rights be grounded in the demands of human freedom, of human agency, of human needs or human dignity? Or in all of these?

Tasioulas begins by asking what gives rights their resistance to trade-offs. Some might think that this is simply a definitional matter: a right is a claim that is not automatically defeated by pointing to interests that would be damaged by failure to respect that claim. Tasioulas points out that that "the claims of interests in practical reason are more vulnerable to defeat than those of rights, since the latter inherently involve counterpart duties, and duties are characterized by two features that confer upon them a greater resistance to trade-offs" (47). The first of these features is the incompatibility between rights and aggregating views of the interests that rights are taken by some to protect, and the second is the "equal dignity of the putative right-holders" (60). I agree that the indispensable link between rights and duties is the crucial step in understanding why rights cannot be wholly, let alone merely, responsive to interests, and that this reflects the fact that violations of duties are a general form of wrongdoing (48), and that duties are "exclusionary in force, putting out of normative play *some* countervailing reasons that would otherwise apply" (47).

It seems to me to follow that any approach to justifying human rights will have to consider what can be said about the counterpart duties. Any justificatory potential that may be derived from appeals to freedom, agency, needs or dignity must take seriously the fact that there can be no rights unless some configuration of counterpart duties that could realise or secure them is possible.

Tasioulas develops his justification of human rights by way of a (lightly historicized) justification of moral rights, in which the part played by interests is combined with a requirement to acknowledge the status (the dignity, the moral worth) of all humans and the consequent need to justify any imposition of duties on others. He formulates this position schematically as follows (50–51):

- (i) For all human beings within a given historical context, and simply in virtue of their humanity, having *X* (the object of the putative right) serves one or more of their basic interests, for example, interests in health, physical security, autonomy, understanding, friendship, achievement, play, etc.
- (ii) The interest in having *X* is, in the case of each human being and simply in virtue of their humanity, pro tanto of sufficient importance to justify the imposition of duties on others, for example, to variously protect, respect or advance their interest in *X*.
- (iii) The duties generated at (ii) are feasible claims on others given the constraints created by general and relatively entrenched facts of human nature and social life in the specified historical context. Therefore:
- (iv) All human beings within the specified historical context have a right to *X*.

This schema is supplemented by an open-ended account of a plurality of grounding interests, which is both more abstract than, and in my view more plausible than, some attempts to list basic human interests. (However, I shall not discuss Tasioulas's critical discussions of attempts to justify human rights by appealing either to basic needs or interests, or to the requirements of agency, in any detail.) Tasioulas's own proposal is that the list of grounding interests relevant to justifying human rights should be "*objective, standardized, pluralistic, open-ended* and *holistic* in character" (51). This approach allows that human interests, and with them the configuration of human rights that they can help justify, may change across history.

This approach has, moreover, to show *which* interests are of sufficient importance to justify the imposition of duties on others. How is this to be done? Would not a requirement to judge whether an interest is of sufficient importance to justify the imposition of duties on others return us to the impossible task of trying to rank interests, while lacking a metric for doing so or for trading them off against one another? To what extent does A's interest in health justify limiting B's physical security? To what extent does C's interest in friendship justify limiting D's right to autonomy? How far can E's interest in food and sustenance justify limiting F's right to achievement? When all goes well and in the absence of scarcity and conflict, it may seem that a system of rights can protect and secure all or most interests for everybody. But at many times not everything goes well; and even when it does, we need both to judge which interests are of sufficient importance to justify the imposition of duties, and which are not, and to understand which duties are to be met by which others.

Tasioulas poses the central question: "For an interest-based approach to rights, the operative question is whether any particular interest of ours—any aspect of our wellbeing—suffices to generate duties on others to respect or protect that interest" (51). I think this quite radical question is the right question to ask: for once we take the moral standing of human beings seriously; any imposition on human beings of duties to respect or protect others' interests requires justification. But how is his question to be answered? One response (which, like him, I would set aside) would be to say that a justification of human rights need not (perhaps cannot) generate an account of others' duties because these will only be made determinate once human rights are institutionally secured. It is true that a *fully* determinate account of others' duties to respect and secure rights will only emerge as duties are institutionalized: but we cannot even tell what we should aim to institutionalize without first saying something about the counterpart duties and their bearers that does not depend on but rather can guide institutionalization. The thought that duties come into the picture only *after* or *through* the construction of the institutions that deliver determinate versions of them at a particular time and place evades rather than settles the fundamental issues about the normative justification of human rights. It fails to address Tasioulas's operative question about identifying *which* interests can or should generate duties on others to respect or protect that interest (51). In effect it concedes that the allocation of duties will not be supported by any deep form of justification, but simply by historical or other contingencies.

## **IV. Rights and Feasible Duties**

There are, I believe, two distinct questions to be addressed. The first asks only how are we to tell when "the specified universal interests of human beings, all of them bearers of equal moral worth, generate in the case of each and every one of them duties to secure the object of the putative right" (57)? A further question asks not merely *which* interests have sufficient importance to generate counterpart duties for someone or other, but *who* holds which counterpart duties. Tasioulas deals with the first of these questions, and I shall discuss it in this section. In the last section of this paper I shall offer some comments on the second question, on which he says much less.

Tasioulas approaches the first question, by aiming to show what "distinguishes human rights from a mere shopping list of valuable 'goals' " (57). The basic feature that makes human rights more than a set of goals is, he suggests, that all right-holders have equal moral worth. Human rights are not the rights of some privileged class of humans, but of all human beings. The premise of the equal status or dignity of all persons has large implications, and most fundamentally requires that any human right be one that could be held by all. It is the reason for thinking of human rights as universal, as held by each and every human being.

One argument to this conclusion is based on premise (ii) of Tasioulas's schematic argument for rights, in which he claims that there is no *pro tanto* case for any duty whose performance would be impossible in the face of "internal impediments". Such internal impediments or impossibilities might be logical, metaphysical or empirical. They offer, for example, a basis for concluding that there can be no right to be both alive and dead at the same time, no right to give birth irrespective of one's sex, and no right to inter-galactic space travel (58). Nobody would think that there can be duties to perform the impossible, or that any of these could be human rights. There may be other disagreements about the full implications of "*ought* implies *can*", but not about this central implication.

This line of thought about the feasibility of rights being held by all leads further if we focus not on the task of respecting or securing rights for a particular person, but on that of respecting or securing them for all others. Tasioulas poses the question: "what is generally compossible by way of duty-fulfilment in the case of all supposed right-holders?" (58). He points out that "given that the rights in question are supposedly *human rights*—rights possessed by all human beings simply in virtue of their humanity—their being possessed by any one human being must be compatible with their being simultaneously possessed by all others within the specified socio-historical context" (58). Consequently there cannot, for example, be rights to live in luxury, although there can (in favourable times) be rights to an "adequate standard of living". This point can be generalized: there cannot be rights to positional goods, since by definition they cannot be procured for all. There are no rights to win, no rights to come first, no rights to have a greater than average income, no rights to live the longest or to be the strongest, and no rights for all children to be above average. Equally, there can be no rights to states of affairs which cannot be delivered for all, such as the enjoyment of good health, but at most rights to health care.

In a third step Tasioulas then suggests that premise (iii) of his basic scheme requires rights to be limited because duties to respect and secure them must make claims that are feasible for the relevant duty-bearers. We must take account of the "joint feasibility of the supposed duties generated severally by each and every supposed right-holder" (60). As an illustration of this point he suggests that the duties that would be implied by a right to "the highest attainable standard of health care" would be excessively burdensome, and that any feasible right to health care will not justify duties that impose this level of burden on others. An advantage of this approach, to which he points, is that it is sensitive to the fact that our assessments of what is feasible may have to change over time, so that we may come to acknowledge rights to action that used not to be feasible (for example, rights to reproductive assistance, or advanced cancer treatments) or cease to think that there can be rights as extensive as we formerly assumed, where the counterpart duties have ceased to be feasible (for example, because of climate change or population growth). This lightly historicised view, it seems to me, puts a plausible distance between claims that human rights are universal and claims that our Stone Age ancestors, or our pre-modern predecessors, or future generations, must have had or will have the very same rights as we do today. (This, of course, leaves many questions about intergenerational justice unanswered.)

#### **V. Who Owes What to Whom?**

Although Tasioulas argues that the duties that correspond to any supposed human right must themselves be not only possible but compossible, indeed feasible for duty-bearers at a given time and place, there is a good deal more to be said about these matters. The way in which he poses the question leads him to consider the compossibility for duty-bearers taken together to respect or secure a given right for all supposed right-holders, but not the compossibility for each duty-bearer of discharging any given right, or indeed a wide range of rights, for a plurality of right-holders. He does not extend his comments on compossibility to consider the range of burdens on duty-bearers who face many (supposed) claims of right.

To say more it is useful to distinguish the case of liberty rights from other rights. In making that distinction I do not mean to suggest either that liberty rights are more important than other rights, or that all of the duties that arise if liberty rights are to be respected and secured will be "negative" duties to refrain from action. Evidently, the duties that arise if liberty rights are to be enforced by the police and the courts will not all be "negative" duties: some duties that are needed to secure liberty rights are positive, have to be allocated to those holding specific roles, and are expensive. However, at the core of these duties there are duties to respect others' liberties, and these first-order duties fall equally on all. Your right to freedom of speech (however configured) is compromised if there is anyone who has no duty to respect it; your right to freedom of movement (however configured) is compromised if there is anyone who has no duty to respect it. A more traditional way of making this point would be to say that if anyone is "above the law", others' liberties will be compromised or incomplete. In the case of liberty rights it matters hugely not only that all have the same rights, but that all have the necessary counterpart duties to respect them. We cannot fully appreciate the weight of Tasioulas's claim that duties must be jointly feasible for dutybearers unless we look not only at the duties "generated severally by each and every supposed right-holder" but also at the duties "held concurrently by each and every supposed duty-bearer".

Fortunately, this does not lead to distinctive problems in judging the compossibility of meeting the duties that are the counterparts to liberty rights. Although it may be exacting to identify the optimal way to configure each liberty right, or a complete and compossible set of liberty rights, for a given society at a given time in its history, with its distinctive opportunities and limitations, the first-order duties that are the counterparts to each compossible configuration of liberty rights will also be compossible. Since compossible liberty rights require specific forms of forbearance or restraint, they will not require action that burdens duty-bearers (although conflicts between duties are always possible): there is not a problem of principle in refraining at one and the same time from injury, perjury, and defamation of others, indeed of all others. Although there are many ways to configure compossible interpretations of rights to privacy and rights to freedom of expression, each requiring specific forms of restraint and forbearance, each will define a compossible set of counterpart duties. Here the compossibility of the rights is matched by the compossibility of the counterpart duties.

However, judging the compossibility of duties that are the counterparts to rights to goods or services (the term "welfare rights" is too narrow and something of a misnomer) is a less tractable matter. The counterpart duties to rights to goods and services require "positive" action of specified sorts by some, and not only forbearance or restraint by all. Here aspects of duties have to be allocated to specified and (it is to be hoped!) competent duty-bearers. In this respect rights to goods and services differ from liberty rights. While it is true that enforcing or guaranteeing rights of either sort needs positive enforcing action by specified institutions and office-holders, rights to goods and services also require some effective allocation of first-order duties if others' rights are to be secured. Consequently rights to goods and services are often indeterminate in the absence of institutionalisation that allocates the relevant duties.

One corollary is that while violators of liberty rights can in principle be identified even where there is no effective way to hold them to account or to enforce compliance—Amnesty International often does so with zeal!—violators of rights to goods or services cannot be identified in the same way. *Whose* dereliction of duty leaves a child or a village in a distant part of the world lacking food, or elementary health care, or clean water, or education? There may be many who could have ensured that (some of) these rights were met, but if the duties to meet them were not allocated to anybody in particular, it seems that the duty lies with nobody, and that nobody is at fault for failing to provide. In such cases—alas, all too common—right-holders can claim goods and services to which they are supposedly entitled only if tasks and roles have been defined and allocated to (competent) duty-bearers. Unsurprisingly, we find that where rights to goods and services are not met, accusations often gesture towards violators in imprecise and ineffective terms: the fault is said to lie with governments (which may or may not have the relevant capacities); with "the international community", with "civil society", with "corporations".

The problem, it seems, is that in the case of rights to goods and services we cannot assess the "joint feasibility of the supposed duties" unless we already know on whom those duties are to fall, what capacities they have, and what other duties they are simultaneously to carry, that may shape or restrict their capacities to carry the relevant "supposed" duties. Here, I believe, it may be useful to reverse perspectives and to consider not the compossibility of rights, but the compossibility of duties. This is complicated, but realistic. Any configuration of human rights that can be held by all, must pay attention not only to the "joint feasibility of the supposed duties generated severally by each and every supposed right-holder", but to the "joint feasibility of the supposed duties falling on each and every duty-bearer". There may be a number of distinct configurations of rights and duties—of normative requirements—that meet both of these feasibility constraints, but taken together they may offer a promising and powerful, though perhaps not a complete, justification both of human rights and of their counterpart duties.
