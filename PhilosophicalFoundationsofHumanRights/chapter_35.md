## [Care and Human Rights](#page-9-2)

#### *Virginia Held*

<span id="page-638-0"></span>Human rights have made remarkable progress in the last half-century. As Joseph Raz, a foremost contemporary legal theorist, notes, "This is a good time for human rights."1 At the start of this period, realism in foreign policy, and in thought about international issues and political theory, was so dominant that moral considerations were widely dismissed as pointless, and considerations of human rights were seen as belonging to the realm of ignorable moral exhortation. There were only a handful of books on morality and international affairs.2 Human rights, as little more than moral goals, were taken seriously by only rather a few practitioners and theorists.

Human rights still have a long way to go in becoming enforceable claims. But there is no doubt that they are taken very seriously not only by many theorists but by activists pressing governments to improve all sorts of conditions, and by courts deciding cases. They are taken seriously by governments around the world. Charges of human rights violations have weight, can notably cut reputations and influence, and actually affect actions and policies. They are widely recognized as an actual part of the world's actual international law.3

This progress illustrates well the "normative pull of law" that is so much of what makes law potentially more effective than it is, and capable of significant improvement. Spelling out the arguments for every person's fundamental rights, and how we ought to respect persons and their rights, gradually persuades more and more people to pay attention to such rights and to shame those who disregard them. We have seen the process at work and should not fail to appreciate it.

At the same time, we can recognize the limitations and fragilities of this progress. Millions and millions of persons in the world continue to die of hunger and preventable illnesses, to be crushed by poverty, felled by violence, and blocked by ignorance. "About half of all human beings live in severe poverty," Thomas Pogge reminds us, "and about a quarter live in extreme or life-threatening poverty . . .About one third of all human deaths, 18 million each year, are due to poverty-related causes."4 How

much is achieved by declaring that all persons have rights to adequate food and health care and security and education is unclear. So much of what is needed cannot be best addressed by progress in the law and legal processes.

## **I. Rights and Human Rights**

Rights are elements of law. Of morality also, along with all sorts of values and virtues, norms and judgments. But when we think of human rights as moral rights we think of them as rights that ought to be enforceable legal rights. As we try to make delineations of rights that are no more than moral into rights that can be effective in the cruel world, we try to translate moral rights into legal ones. For instance, when a moral right to freedom of expression is recognized within a given legal system as an enforceable legal claim, we can judge that the relevant human right is respected. And when the human right to freedom of expression is invoked to criticize and perhaps sanction an actual government that fails to respect it, what we are criticizing is that government's failure to provide or protect the relevant legal right. As Pogge expresses it, "human rights are not merely part of the law but also moral standards that all law ought to meet and a standard that is not yet met by much existing law in many countries."5

We ought also to consider, however, how *rights* may not be the best focus to give to the moral considerations with which we have started. It may be that it was the dominant moral theories at the time Declarations of Human Rights were developed that led to the concentration on rights and justice at the expense of many other moral approaches. With different emphases in moral thinking, we might be thinking more about other ways than those of rights and law to address various moral concerns. And that is what I am exploring in this chapter. I do not intend my inquiry here to be a critique of human rights, which I see as highly justified in their appropriate domain. What I question is the nearly exclusive focus of attention on the approach of justice through law and rights. Rights and law belong to a limited domain within the social, which must be composed of relations that are at least somewhat caring. At this level, caring is weak, but essential nevertheless. Without enough of us caring that our fellow members of society are treated decently there will not be sufficient trust and support to enable a legal or political system, or the implementation of human rights, to function. An approach that focuses on care rather than rights might be a promising alternative, at least for various problems.

In the half-century considered that has led to such progress in the development of human rights, a major new approach to morality has been developed by feminist theorists interested in the ethics of care. And from this perspective, the emphasis on rights appears limited at best. Alternative approaches are in need of development and may be highly important.

Fiona Robinson considers the way issues of morality in international affairs have, in standard discussions, emphasized the rights of states and individuals, and their corresponding duties. "Analysis of the ethical dimension of international relations,"

5 Pogge, "Are We Violating the Human Rights of the World's Poor?", 7.

she writes, "is dominated overwhelmingly by the liberal–contractualist language of rights."6 She explores how different the issues would look from the perspective of a critical ethics of care. I agree, and will suggest some ways, for various issues.

Consider the definition of a human right offered by Joseph Raz. He writes that he takes human rights to be "rights which set limits to the sovereignty of states, in that their actual or anticipated violation is a (defeasible) reason for taking action against the violator in the international arena" even when doing so would otherwise infringe on such a state's sovereignty.7 Now consider applying such a conception of violating human rights to an impoverished state dealing with violence between its ethnic groups whose government cannot possibly provide for the basic necessities of each person within its borders. It may be a government so corrupt that it intentionally or just carelessly violates the human rights of its inhabitants on a massive scale, but it may be a government simply unable to respect their rights. Such a government may request outside aid, but intervention against the will of such a state, intervention that violated its sovereignty, would hardly be called for.

Traditionally, rights, including early understandings of human rights, were developed as negative rights against governments and other persons, assuring that persons would essentially be left alone, free from attack and interference. The history of notions of human rights heavily emphasized rights to be free from interference by governments and other persons as we live our lives, pursue our interests, accumulate wealth, and express our views. Such conceptions led to the familiar lists of civil and political rights such as rights to freedom of expression, to a fair trial, and to participate in a government based on the will of the people. More recently it has been acknowledged throughout most of the world, although not in the US legal system, that persons have positive rights to basic necessities, to what they need to live and act. To the traditional lists of civil and political rights have in recent decades been added the lists of economic and social rights that reflect the awareness that if we lack the basic resources of food, shelter, health, and the like, we will be unable to be an agent of any kind, free or unfree.

Those of us writing on morality and concerned with such problems as poverty and health care have argued for decades that conceptions of rights are badly inadequate unless they include what we think of as welfare rights. It is hardly satisfactory to imagine that a person's human rights are respected if they are merely left alone without the food or resources needed to live their lives and pursue their interests.8 Traditional and dominant liberal conceptions of the already self-sufficient individual need revision. It was vindication of the views of those who insisted that rights include welfare rights that, however resistant to them the US legal system remained, lists of economic and social rights became part of the conceptions of human rights recognized

in international law in such documents as the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).9

These rights have never become firmly established even in the human rights discourse. While they may be suitable and important to argue for in the context of adequate social welfare programs in developed countries that can well afford them, they are awkwardly invoked in the context of massive global poverty. They only become meaningful as rights when we have some clarity about how and by whom they are to be fulfilled, and some way to assure that progress toward achieving this will be made. Seen as Kantian imperfect duties, questions about their fulfillment are left so vague as to be of dubious use. And discussion of Kantian obligations to alleviate global poverty, Fiona Robinson writes, "end up faltering on the question of motivation."10 For much of what human rights are used to argue for in the global context, other moral notions may often be more suitable.

How to implement positive rights to food, shelter, basic medical care, and the like in a global context has been and continues to be thoroughly controversial. Doing so would seem to require enormous restructurings of economic arrangements, of governmental policies, of cultural recognitions of the interests of various groups. Much that would be needed reaches far beyond the legal systems of individual states and beyond their governments. Even when conceptions of rights are expanded to include group rights along with individual rights,11 many of the relevant issues seem to fit awkwardly within the purview of rights rather than of other moral considerations. Not all that we do or want or think we ought to aim at can possibly be captured within the essentially legal notion of right or human right. Even with the moral theories that emphasize the moral right as distinct from the moral good, we know that to do what is right is not at all the same as to have a right, and the former is far wider than the latter.

Thomas Pogge holds that the global economic order is responsible for the massive violation of human rights constituted by the annual deaths of many millions of persons from hunger and preventable disease.12 Persistent global poverty results, he claims, from the enforceable legal order of trade and property law. Robert Howse and Ruti Teitel in the same volume doubt that blame can be assigned so clearly, but note that even if it could, it is unclear what respecting human rights would prescribe for the reform of the global economic order.13 Pogge points to the morally deplorable practice of corrupt regimes that enter into commercial arrangements whereby they are accorded large loans they can squander on themselves, while their successors and their impoverished populations are left with the legally enforceable bills to be paid. But interpreting what respect for the human rights of such citizens would

require in the way of changing such practices is hard to discern. As Howse and Teitel point out, it might entail serious costs and questionable benefits to have more responsible successor governments repudiate such state obligations. Undoing the legal foundation that *pacta sunt servanda* (states are to keep their agreements) might be dangerous indeed.

Recognizing the way negative duties are theoretically more compelling than positive ones, Pogge has recently formulated our obligations to the world's poor as a negative requirement that we stop collaborating "in the imposition of unjust institutional arrangements" on the world's poor.14 But when he outlines some concrete measures to be taken to do this, similar doubts arise.

Many of our most important relations are not legal ones except in the most peripheral sense approached by the misleading claim that law covers "everything" because whatever it does not forbid, it allows. Our relations with family and friends only become legal in a significant way when disputes arise, as about custody or unpaid loans. When we interact with our neighbors we seldom need to invoke the law. Even when cities cooperate with other cities around the world to solve various problems, law and legal enforcement and the legal institutions of states often remain in the background.15 Most of the time the rich patterns of connection and relatedness, and dependency and mutual pursuit of mutual interests proceed without the intervention of the law. And yet they are often guided by moral considerations. When we attend to the kind of morality suitable for these sorts of relations, we see how they are not especially focused on rights and their corresponding duties. They concern themselves far more with sensitivity to the needs of others, with responding to actual needs, and with trust and mutuality. It is persuasive to argue that rights *can* protect our fundamental needs. But their focus on individuals is not always appropriate, nor is the focus on law that they require, and it is clear that they often *do* not protect even the most basic needs of millions of people.

Women and members of minorities understand how limited is the reach of law when bias is exercised in offering opportunities or in evaluating performance. Only the most blatant of cases or egregious of practices can be addressed by law and legal remedies. Certainly legal rights to equal treatment are highly important, but in advancing equality much more than law is needed. Cultural change must precede and accompany and go beyond legal enactments of rights. The experience of the gay rights movement offers much evidence. So too with many human rights.

Perhaps a focus on the moral approaches of care would be suitable for dealing with many of the most serious problems facing the globe's inhabitants. They might supplement or strengthen or perhaps even be more effective than the approach of human rights.

## **II. The Ethics of Care**

In the half-century during which the human rights agenda has moved from vague moral goal to somewhat effective influence, a significant development has occurred within the domain of moral theory. The previously dominant theories of Kantian morality and utilitarian ethics have been joined by the new feminist approach of the ethics of care.

The ethics of care is an important strand of feminist thought, though many feminists are not advocates of the ethics of care. Almost all feminists want to revise existing conceptions of justice and human rights to better assure the rights of women.16 Feminists have examined the issues of global gender justice, showing how "women everywhere are disproportionately vulnerable to poverty, abuse, and political marginalization."17 They want to add requirements for women's equality and protections against violence to lists that fail to provide for them. Alison Jaggar considers whether the definition of genocide should be "expanded to include female infanticide, the systematic withholding of food, medical care, and education from girls, and the battery, starvation, mutilation, and even murder of adult women," and rights against genocide understood accordingly.18

Many feminists want to go further and to reconceptualize moral theory itself, recognizing the bias in the approaches of the dominant theories.19 A major way in which this has been done is in the development of the ethics of care.20

The ethics of care has been built on the acknowledgment of the enormous amount of valuable and unrecognized labor involved in care, especially the care of children, without which there would be no persons to fit the traditional images of those for whom morality is devised. The ethics of care starts not with the fully formed individual agent considering how he ought to act, but with the basic recognition that human beings are dependent on other human beings and are essentially vulnerable and in need of care for substantial parts of their lives.

It is remarkable how much the concept of 'liberal individual' at the heart of the dominant moral theories still rests on the Lockean image of a man going off into unoccupied territory (Locke said he could always go to America), clearing the land, tilling the soil, and acquiring property through his own labor. Now, few of us even

grow our own food, let alone make our own possessions. As any number of Marxists have reminded us repeatedly, we are all highly interdependent.

The ethics of care rests on a conception of persons as relational and interdependent, and on an appreciation of the values of care embedded in practices of care. Although existing practices are usually structured by social arrangements in need of reform, especially in the way women are pressed into providing the overwhelming proportion of care, we can discern the values in existing practices and even more satisfactorily in such practices as they ought to be.

The ethics of care has developed care as a value of at least as much importance as justice. And perhaps it is even more fundamental. Persons can exist without justice but they cannot exist without the value-laden care essential for every child to live. Attending to care and its practices brings to the fore such values as empathetic understanding, sensitivity to the needs of others and especially, responsiveness to such needs. It calls especially for trust between care givers and recipients, and for understanding the relations between them as much from the point of view of the recipient of care as of the provider.21 This offers the moral resources for good relations of care, and it is caring relations that are especially valued.

The ethics of care is not a kind of consequentialism, evaluating actions only in terms of their consequences, although attention to the effectiveness of any given activities involved in the practice of care is important in evaluating those activities. But the activities can also be valued on more deontological grounds in terms of the caring intentions and motives they express. Care seeks to meet effectively, and with sensitivity and respect, the actual needs of embodied persons located in actual contexts. It appreciates and relies on the caring emotions and rejects the view of the dominant theories that morality must be based only on ideal, abstract, impartial principles recognizable by reason.

Care is based especially on experience. Without care, no human person would survive into adulthood to become the rational individual of traditional moral theories. Every person has received care that has incorporated moral values, and every person can reflect on his or her experience of practices of care. Many such practices are inadequate, paternalistic, domineering, insensitive, and should be reformed. Those who provide care often fail to provide good care, but they and the recipients of such care can reflect on how it should be improved. The ethics of care has no need for the religious foundations of many other moral theories, foundations that are divisive and unpersuasive to those not sharing the religion of such foundations. The ethics of care is based on experience that truly is universal: the experience of care. Care is both practice and value.

Marian Barnes, who writes on the practice of care in the social services, describes the emphasis of care ethics on lived experience. "A key argument of an ethic of care," she writes, "is that care as practice and as moral and political value cannot be understood in the abstract. We need to consider the lived experience of giving and receiving

<sup>21</sup> For discussion of practices that might adequately bring the perspectives of recipients of care into the making of policies, and provision and delivery of social services, see Marian Barnes, *Care In Everyday Life: An Ethic of Care in Practice* (Bristol, UK: The Policy Press, 2012).

care, and how context, conflicts and power impact the difficult moral decisions as well as the practical tasks of care."22

The care alternative started with feminist attention to the vast area of experience provided by caring work performed mostly by women and almost completely ignored by dominant moral theorists. This area was largely written off by moral theorists as belonging to "nature" rather than morality or the distinctively human. It was seen as "governed by natural instinct" and as irrelevant to morality. As David Heyd wrote, in a comment typical of the time, a mother's sacrifice for her child need not be thought relevant to morality or contrary to assumptions about persons acting on self-interest because it belongs to "the sphere of natural relationships and instinctive feelings (*which lie outside morality*)."23

To feminists, it gradually became clear that the care in which we engaged was infused with moral considerations, presented endless moral problems and possibilities, and was clearly relevant to what we thought about morality. It was clear that emotion had value, not only in carrying out the dictates of reason but in discerning what ought to be done and in acting morally. The emotion of caring was not to be dismissed as irrational or threatening to morality, or simply instinctive, but to be appreciated. Moral action in this context was not simply based on what was an empirically given natural tendency. Nor was it based purely on impartial principles recognized by reason, or on rational self-interest, or on a calculation of maximizing preference satisfaction, as the dominant moral theories would have to construe it to be to fit their assumptions.

Care should not be understood as self-sacrifice. Egoism versus altruism is the wrong way to interpret the issues. Yes, the interests of care giver and care receiver will sometimes conflict, but for the most part we do not pit our own interests against those of others in this context. We want what will be good for both or all of us together. We want our children and others we care for to do well along with ourselves, and for the relations between us to be good ones. If we are the recipients of care we want our care givers to do well along with us. The whole framework of self *versus* other needs to be revised for this context, and then perhaps for others.

The beginnings of the ethics of care can be traced to the work of Sara Ruddick on the thinking involved in the practice of mothering,24 and the work of Nel Noddings in examining the phenomenology of care work.25 The initial delineation of care in contrast with justice emerged with the psychological inquiries of Carol Gilligan, who found differences in the ways most men and boys on the one hand, and many women and girls on the other, interpreted moral problems.26 The men and boys studied tended to construe the problems presented as calling for the application of abstract moral

principles, such as principles of justice, to situations of conflicting rights. Many of the women and girls studied interpreted the problems as particular and concrete, as problems of maintaining human relationships and meeting the actual needs of those for whom they felt responsible. The "different voice" of care was thus distinguished from the more traditional moral approaches. And in subsequent decades the ethics of care was further developed by feminist moral philosophers and contrasted with the ethics of justice of the dominant Kantian and utilitarian approaches.

There are affinities between care theory and virtue theories but there are important differences.27 The ethics of care values caring relations rather than the mere virtuous dispositions of individuals—to be compassionate for instance. Some elements of the moralities of the British sentimentalists and especially of Hume's ethics can be noted and built upon in care theory.28 But the ethics of care sees persons as relational, not the independent individuals of the British moralists. More importantly, the ethics of care is a feminist moral outlook and approach built on experience that has not been the focus of previous moral theories.

As feminists have developed the alternative moral approach of the ethics of care, they have been able to see its potential for more and more of what morality is called on to do: to guide and motivate actions that ought to be taken and lives that ought to be led. It is easiest to see how the approach of care is appropriate for the more personal contexts of families and friendship, where the awkwardness of the dominant rationalistic and universalistic moralities are most clear: we do not play with our children out of respect for the moral law, yet playing with our children is part of good care, care that has moral value. We do not offer sympathy to our friends who are ill because of a calculation that it would produce the greatest good of the greatest number, but because we care for them.

When the inclination flags to do what caring calls for, as often happens when there is too much to do and too many demands on one, one may look to duty for instructions on the most stringent requirements of care. No matter how otherwise busy one may be, one must keep one's child safe and in health if possible. At the same time, one can recognize the superiority of the motive of caring rather than obligation in contexts of care, and recognize that the motivation underlying our performance of duty is our caring.

As the ethics of care has flourished, its relevance to political and social and global issues has been made more and more evident.29 Instead of entrenching the division between "public" and "private" supported by traditional moralities, the ethics of care breaks down the division and shows the relevance of the personal to the political.

Instead of resembling a contract voluntarily entered into between independent, equal, and self-interested individuals, or autonomous and rational individuals making laws for themselves and all others, the ethics of care starts with interdependent embodied persons in actual historical and social and personal circumstances. It applies to persons of highly unequal power in relationships that they often did not choose. Parents have vast power over their helpless infants and morality calls on them not to misuse it. None of us can choose our parents yet morality is heavily involved in how we deal with them. We only become the independent autonomous individuals of dominant moral theories with the enormous help of the many other persons with whom we are interdependent.

The strength of applying the ethics of care to issues such as global poverty and deprivation can be envisioned. Theorists have tried to deal with these problems in terms of human rights, with very limited success. The use of the ethics of care might be more promising and effective.

It may be thought that an advantage of conceptualizing these issues in terms of the rights of the poor is that this avoids the paternalism and imperialism of traditional efforts of charity, benevolence, and humanitarian aid. But care theory is to be based on the experience of care receivers as fully as of care providers. It calls for the relations between them to especially avoid being paternalistic and imperialistic and to be, instead, trusting, considerate, and characterized by mutuality.

Fiona Robinson argues that "practices of care are the basic substance of morality," and recognition of our responsibilities should lead to "sustained attention to people not as autonomous rights-bearers but as relational subjects who are both givers and receivers of care."30 While rights and interests are important to care, "they must always be understood as embedded in and realized through existing social and political arrangements."31 A critical ethics of care, Robinson emphasizes, must pay attention to the ongoing and everyday global relations that so seriously fail to meet peoples' needs. In contrast to the way international relations discussion usually deals with "moral issues" by focusing on moments of crisis, attention to care could "form the basis for a new international political theory." It would challenge "our conventional views of which individuals, groups or states are 'dependent' on which others, and how."32 The increasing dependence of the global North on the global South for the provision of care work is one example. More familiarly, one can recall the dependence of the well-off on the workers who produce value, and the dependence of those who govern on the support of those who are governed. Interdependence surrounds us.

The ethics of care has been shown to be relevant to and promising for the quest for peace and the reduction of violence in international affairs.33 It can be shown that the

ethics of care would lead to respect for international law in the short term, because of the contributions international law can make to peace and civility and mutual benefit among states and groups.34 At the same time, we can speculate that as care became more influential, there would be in the longer term a reduction in the need for and reliance on law, both within states and among them.

The ethics of care calls for the transformation of the different domains within society, as, for instance, it asks that the institutions of the law or of health care be more caring. But it also and especially asks for the transformation of the relations between these domains.35 In a caring society, the state and the economy would not be aimed above all at military prowess and economic dominance, while child care and much health care were left at the margins for people to deal with on their own as best they could. A caring society would enable many forms of care, education, non-commercial cultural expression, and economic activity that actually served real needs to be at the center of attention. As the institutions and practices of care would become more satisfactory, the need for law and it enforcements would diminish.

As the values of care were extended to a global level, the building of more caring approaches to global connectedness would increase. If global problems were addressed more fundamentally in ways called for by the ethics of care, the need for and appeal to law would become less likely. Addressing global poverty and deprivation would be a leading example of the kind of urgent problem that is not primarily an issue of law. It does not have the kind of remedy that legal institutions can well address. It might be more promising to think that it should be addressed not only because it violates human rights, which it certainly does, but more urgently because care demands it.

### **III. Rights and Care**

The foundations of human rights have clearly been the dominant political theories of the liberal–contractualist tradition and the rationalist moral theories of Kantian ethics and utilitarianism in contrast with which the ethics of care developed.

Feminists influenced by the ethics of care may well have reservations about the human rights agenda. Not that it is misguided, but that it may not emphasize what is most important or most needed in many actual situations. Or that appeals to human rights may count for too little without the underlying emotions of caring that needs are met and rights are respected.

Rights and human rights attach to individuals conceptualized as separable entities in a way that is often misleading. The ethics of care works with conceptions of persons as relational, dependent, interdependent. Such a view is much more appropriate for populations dying of hunger and easily preventable disease.

In trying to bring morality into the arena of international relations, human rights, along with the laws of war, have been by far the major focus. This focus diverts our

attention from relational issues, where we recognize the dependency of human beings on others and on their environments.

Rights are tied to justice, and the ethics of care can be seen as contrasting with moralities of justice. It is persuasive to think of the dominant moralities of justice—Kantian ethics and utilitarianism—as generalizations to the whole of morality of moral approaches suitable for law and government but much more questionable as moralities for contexts of family and friendship where care and its values would seem, once we pay attention to these neglected contexts, to have priority. We can then see how relevant care is to social and global concerns as well.

Human rights are tied to liberal conceptions of persons as independent, self-sufficient, autonomous. This disregards the vulnerability, the need for care, the interdependency of actual persons. Rights are primarily *against* others: governments, and other persons. Care focuses especially on *mutual* interests. When we care for another person we do not construe our situation primarily as one of conflicting interests where your gain is my loss and my gain is your loss. As parents, we *want* our children to thrive and to do well. As children grow and become more independent, they want their frail and aged parents to be well cared for. We want what will be good for us together, mutually. The approach of care recognizes the fantastical and distorted picture of human reality in the "state of nature," on which notions of human rights are importantly based.

Economic and social rights are much closer to the concerns of care, but they are still individualized, whereas care understands how often the issues concern groups, collectivities, and relations between persons.

From the perspective of the ethics of care, there would certainly be agreement with Pogge that the advanced countries of the world have a moral obligation to rapidly reduce the hunger and deprivation that afflicts so many millions of people in the poor countries. It is an obvious and outrageous affront to the values of care that in a world that can easily afford it, millions of children die from hunger and preventable diseases. But the basis for the argument would be the care that needs to underlie respect for persons, to motivate assurance of rights, and to guide efforts to meet the needs of the suffering.

Fiona Robinson writes that a critical ethics of care would focus our attention on "the permanent background of those decisions which must be taken in times of crisis. From this perspective, ethics in international relations is concerned. . .with the nature and quality of existing social relations."36 The ethics of care would demand that we attend more to global poverty and the way "normative international relations theory has systematically obscured the extent to which the everyday processes, practices, and social relations in international relations often lead to devastating levels of human suffering."37

Discussion of poverty has focused on rights within a liberal–contractualist framework, but "rights-based ethics," Robinson writes, "exalts the value of individual autonomy."38 What is needed instead, she argues, is a "restructuring of political action in such a way that enduring relationships can flourish and agents can focus their moral

<sup>38</sup> Robinson, *Globalizing Care*, 148.

attention and, ultimately, act with the virtues of care—attentiveness, responsiveness, and responsibility."39 It is our "feelings of connection and responsibility in our personal and social relations" that actually motivate us, Robinson writes.40 To motivate those in rich countries to do what respect for the rights of the poor would require, we need to build the social relations that "encourage agents to be attentive and responsive and to recognize shared responsibilities. . . "41

Sarah Clark Miller examines the "justice-dominated discourse" apparent in dealing with the global problems that morality ought to address. "Cosmopolitan theories of justice," she writes, "have dominated contemporary philosophical discussions of global responsibility."42 In her book, *The Ethics of Need: Agency, Dignity, and Obligation*, she argues instead for "cosmopolitan care." She considers the shortcomings of the dominance of justice and rights in cosmopolitan thinking about global moral issues. These shortcomings are their "hyper-individualism, idealization, abstraction, and acontextuality."43

She delineates instead a feminist ethical outlook based on views of persons as relational, interconnected, interdependent, vulnerable, and located in actual contexts. "Persons," from this perspective, are "vulnerable moral agents with inevitable needs. As embodied and finite, humans share a susceptibility to suffering and needing."44 Hence she aims to respond to the shortcomings of the emphasis on justice in thinking about global moral problems with a "relational, nonidealized, contextual oppression-informed account of feminist global responsibility."45

She shows how an emphasis on "human interdependence, vulnerability, need, and care might transform the current justice-dominated discourse of global responsibility."46 In her view it would lead to recognition of a global "duty to care." She concludes that we should understand care as a "practice of taking responsibility for others' well-being in the context of dependency relations, of responding to their needs," and of "acknowledging and fostering moral atunement to the vicissitudes of their lives." We would then, she thinks, recognize how care ethics is relevant to intimate spheres and also "to ethical, social, and political spheres at the national and international level."47

In her book, *Care for the World: Fear, Responsibility and Justice,* Elena Pulcini shows how inadequate justice is when it is a merely rational principle.48 Building in part on the recent discourse of care, she argues that justice needs the emotions of indignation at injustice to motivate acting to overcome failures of justice. As we survey the extraordinary deprivations and suffering of millions of people in the poor countries of the globe, we can agree that merely recognizing rights is painfully insufficient. From the point of view of care, we could say that we need to practice care, to care that rights

are respected and implemented, and to engage in the caring that will actually meet the goals of morality.

Using the example of the way states deal with asylum seekers, Elizabeth Porter argues that compassion is both possible and necessary in politics. Influenced by the ethics of care, she examines the appropriateness of emotions in political life: anger at injustice, shame at callous governmental decisions, frustration at promises unkept. "Feminists have come to see," she writes, "compassionate empathy as 'the essence of morality' . . . " not only in personal relationships but importantly in political life.49

One of the strengths of the ethics of care is that it deals with the world as it is. It thus avoids some of the problems of ideal conceptions of justice that only awkwardly connect or fail to connect with the actual world.

One can and should agree with human rights theorists, and cosmopolitan justice theorists, that every person has a human right to the basic necessities that they need to live and to be an agent. But this is still a statement of a moral ideal. In the world as it is, this right is not being assured to vast numbers of persons, or even addressed at a reasonable level of effectiveness even by those who recognize the validity of the claims that all have such rights. The numbers of children under five in the world who die of hunger or preventable disease has in recent years been cut to 7 million.50 But it is still 7 million! From the perspective of care this is so outrageous as to be unbelievable. How can responsible human beings be letting this happen? As Pogge points out, only a little more than *half* of what the richest one-twentieth of the world's population have *gained* in the past decades of globalization would have enabled the world's poor to attain an adequate standard of living.51

One moral recommendation that follows from recognizing the rights of all is that we ought to work to increase the implementation of these rights, and we can agree that we ought to do that. But for the foreseeable future there will be many times and places where many of these rights are not being assured. And there will always be emergency cases—natural disasters for instance, and increasingly, weather disasters induced by climate change—where they cannot be.

Trying to deal with situations of dire deprivation in terms of rights will always have limited utility. As David Hume pointed out, justice applies to situations of moderate scarcity. In situations of extreme scarcity, justice breaks down and in cases of complete abundance, there is no need for justice.52

In dire circumstances, we do not want to say that child A has more of a right to limited aid than child B. Both have rights to what they desperately need. But the world as it exists is full of triage and lifeboat-like situations. The ethics of care can handle these where the framework of rights breaks down. We do want to care for both child A and child B, but if we only have the resources to care for one, we should use those resources in the ways that will do the most good. Yes, they both have equal rights, and fairness might require something like a lottery. But in the real desperation of humanitarian

assistance, this might not be the best policy. It is morally legitimate to consider how the constraints of acting rapidly may be more important than the demands of fairness. Those guided by the values of care understand these moral considerations where those looking to the legalistic framework of rights and justice are left with the conclusion that morality breaks down in these situations.

It is certainly true that we ought to work to reduce the occurrence of lifeboat situations. We ought to move towards recognizing the human rights, including rights to what they need to live, of all. Justice requires it and the ethics of care will agree. But we also need moral guidance for when assurance of such rights is no more than a distant goal, and for all the situations when it is impossible to assure them.

The ethics of care starts with actual, dependent, often helpless, vulnerable human beings: for example, a child. Care responds to the needs of such beings. Good care, morally recommended care, does so with sensitivity, effectiveness, intelligence, and good will. It reflects the experience and points of view of recipients as well as providers of care. And it does not give up or break down even when law is ineffective. It recognizes the urgency of need and moves us to respond. And in contrast with views that recommend versions of Pareto optimality and primarily counsel gradualism, care has ways to demand that we respond to urgent problems urgently.

The distinction between positive and negative rights and duties that creates such difficulties for rights-based efforts to deal with global poverty is much less of a problem for the ethics of care: of course you ought to not bludgeon your child, but above all you should feed her; as elderly and infirm, of course you want to not be assaulted, but you especially want to be able to eat. As Fiona Robinson notes, starting with our "contextual, situated experience," as we would from the perspective of care, the goals of impartiality and universality would "recede into the background."53

### **IV. Care, Migration, and Climate Change**

Other global problems for which the conceptual framework of justice and rights may be inadequate include the vast migrations of care workers currently taking place. In recent years, massive numbers of workers have been migrating from poor countries to developed ones to engage in care work.54 Economic pressures lead them to leave their own families in the global South to provide care work in the global North. Often they have been trained as nurses or teachers in their own countries, but they can earn more as domestics or in the ill-paid positions of health or elder care institutions in rich countries than if they worked at their professions in their home countries. This causes a shortage of trained care workers in the poor countries where they are most needed. Frequently, migrants headed for care work become pressed into sex work or are the victims of sex

trafficking and then unable to send funds to the families they left out of concern for their welfare.55

Defenders of markets and globalization accept these developments without serious objection. Care work has been increasingly commodified, bought and sold in the market, for many years. As more women in the developed world enter the labor market, there are opportunities for others to replace them in their previously unpaid care work. Migrant care workers are usually not overtly coerced. They and their families benefit from the additional earnings the migrants receive. Often their home countries support these migrations because their economies benefit from the remittances sent home. And yet there are other factors to consider than market ones.

Eva Kittay tries to articulate the harm involved when mothers in poor countries leave their own children in the care of relatives to do care work in households and nursing homes and hospitals in the developed countries. Because the distances are great and the costs of travel high, they may not see their own children for many years at a time. Kittay asserts that "there is an important harm to the migrant women's central relationships."56 It is a harm not just to the individual woman but to the whole transnational family, and the issues are not easily addressed, she finds, in the traditional theories from which challenges and defenses are usually drawn.

Kittay notes that "because caring relationships and the right to nurture these (a right to give care) are so critical to one's self-respect. . .the injury to the migrant careworker is also an injury to her self-respect. . . "57 Using conceptions derived from the ethics of care, she argues that "among the most serious harms people experience are the fracturing of central relationships."58 Care workers suffer a grievous injustice in having to choose between caring for their own families or migrating for remittances because of unjust global and national basic institutions. Kittay argues for a right to provide care as well as a right to receive the care one needs. Fiona Robinson asks that attention be paid "to the ways in which parents themselves may be empowered to care adequately for their own children."59

Kittay thus tries to deal with the issues involved in migrant care labor by revising the conceptions of rights and justice of traditional theories such as Rawls'. Others examining the transnational "care chains" that have developed conclude that the traditional language and concepts of rights and justice are not satisfactory for understanding and evaluating the issues. As Rianne Mahon and Fiona Robinson write, "traditional concepts of rights, justice, and citizenship may be inadequate to address the contemporary challenge of care and well-being at the transnational scale . . .[A]n ethics of care is best suited to illuminate these issues. . .Care ethics can serve as a lens through which to focus and organize our thinking about the ways in which care is delivered... "60 And Yasmeen Abu-Laban concludes that the ethics of care, better than

the dominant cosmopolitan approaches, allows us to deal with problems at a global level.61 It is attuned to the relationality of persons and to power differences. It may allow us to move from the "world of strangers" of traditional moral and political theories to the "world of relationships" that exists and is involved in such issues as migration. Care ethics, Abu-Laban writes, has great potential for re-envisioning policy.62

We seem to need to move beyond our established understandings of justice and rights to deal with and to evaluate such developments as the migrations of care workers. We also may need to do so with issues concerning the environment and climate change. Our obligations are to future generations and perhaps to the environment itself. Such obligations can only metaphorically be thought of as based on the human rights of persons who do not yet exist. The moral issues may be more fruitfully handled in terms of care for future persons and groups, and care for the environment.

When considering environmental issues, it is entirely unsatisfactory to think that the moral problems involved reduce to questions of human rights. Then, when we move beyond the domain of the human, it may be more satisfactory to think in terms of the values of species rather than the rights of individual members, and, in turn, of ecosystems rather than of individual species.63 This does not suggest, however, that we should be indifferent to the non-human individuals involved. Caring about their well-being is appropriate, as is caring for the environment. It is also important to understand the role of gender in how traditional views of "man and nature" have been construed.64 Configuring moral problems in terms of the rights of man, and then belatedly adding women to the category of rights-holders, hardly addresses most environmental issues.

Problems such as that of climate change, like the problems of global poverty and of migration, will require serious and fundamental changes in our economic arrangements. The ethics of care would have the normative resources to guide the restructuring of economic orders so that economic activity really would meet the needs of all, instead of primarily enriching the already advantaged. The ethics of care would recommend limits on markets in ways that ethics of justice and rights have not.65 It would comprehend the relations, relations of power and dependence and attachment and interdependence, within which and with which economic activity is conducted.

### **V. Law, Society, and Care**

Legal systems are created and exist within societies. Societies are much more than their legal systems. A collection of liberal individuals all pursuing their own interests,

or rationally contracting with each other to agree on the rules within which they will do so, but with nothing to hold them together, do not make a state or a society, or a world willing to respect the human rights of all.

There has been in recent years a large and welcome growth of appreciation for the importance of civil society. The members of civil society may find other institutions than legal ones appropriate for any number of the purposes with which they interact. When persons come together to play sports, engage in artistic productions, share interests in religion or intellectual activities, these engagements of civil society are not primarily legal ones. And for the rights of law to be upheld, the members of society must care enough about their fellow members to care that they are.

Before democracy can work well or legal systems of rights and obligations function adequately, the connections and interactions of civil society must be sufficiently developed.66 Social bonds are needed to hold the foundations of law and political institutions together. For law to uphold rights and assure the fulfillment of obligations, civil society must provide sufficient trust and practice at cooperative interactions for there to be functioning legal institutions.

The most useful way for us to think of the social connections of civil society, with its associations and clubs and groups and congregations and leagues, is, I have argued, in terms of caring relations.67 These are not the strong caring relations of family and friendship, but they are a long way from the indifference at the heart of the leading theories of justice.68

Before people can agree on the political principles underlying their legal institutions, they need to understand who are included among those between whom agreement is to be imagined or sought. Political theories standardly assume rather than confront these problems of boundaries and membership. We have begun to see the large-scale development of civil society organizations at the global level.69 Increasingly, it can be hoped that all persons everywhere in the world can agree on human rights, including rights to basic necessities. But to have institutions that can make such rights more than very distant moral goals, people everywhere would need to have sufficient trust and mutuality and responsiveness to the needs of all to make such institutions work. Even Pogge says that "if citizens of Western states cared about the avoidance of [global] poverty, then so would their politicians," and action would be taken.70

The priority of social ties is an empirical condition for the relevant institutions. It is also a normative priority since moral recommendations must have sufficient moral force for persons to care whether morality is honored or not. The ethics of care is capable of providing such normative force and is suitable for doing so.
