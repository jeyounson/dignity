## *Victor Tadros**

It may seem that the central question to ask when considering the human right to security is: Is there a human right to security, and if so what is its source and content? This question, though, is unhelpfully unspecific for two reasons. First, until the object of security is clarified, the scope of the question is unclear. The main focus of the right to security has been on security from serious criminal offending. But we ought also to be interested in security from state wrongdoing and security from natural disasters. Hence, in a discussion of the right to security, we could include food security, water security, security from disease, security of accommodation, and so on.

Secondly, and more importantly, what the question asks depends on our conception of human rights. Many think that human rights are rights that we have in virtue of our status as human. Some think that human rights are distinctive in being rights held against states. Some think that human rights are distinctive in that international interference with sovereign states is permitted to enforce only these rights. Theories of human rights differ about which of these features are essential features of human rights. For reasons outlined later, I think that there is no good way of adjudicating these disputes, and that even if there was there would be no point in doing so. We should abandon the philosophy of human rights.

For this reason, I will not aim to answer the question with which I began. Nevertheless, making progress on the ethical questions that some of the discussion of the human right to security has been concerned with is important. I aim to make modest progress with these questions by distinguishing between different kinds of rights. That will help to structure our thinking about the relationship between rights and duties with respect to security at national and international levels.

As Liora Lazarus notes, the right to security has been understood as both a negative and a positive right.1 On this understanding it grounds both negative duties not to harm or affect others in various ways and positive duties to protect others from being harmed or affected. I think that the right to security is better understood solely as a positive right—the correlate of the right is a set of positive duties of protection. Understood as a negative right, the right to security is simply an umbrella term for a range of more specific rights, such as the right not to be killed or the right

to bodily integrity. Even understood as a positive right, the right to security is problematically umbrella-like given the range of threats that people may face. But at least in evaluating the right to security as a positive right we focus on a distinctive moral question: to what extent are there positive duties of protection against threats, and how are they related to duties and permissions on states and on the international community?

Debate about the right to security can usefully be structured by answering these four broad questions:

- (1) Are there any enforceable positive duties to protect others?
- (2) To what extent do these duties fall on states?
- (3) Under what circumstances and in what way should the right to security be enshrined in a state's constitution?
- (4) In what circumstances is the international community permitted or required to interfere with sovereign states to enforce duties of security, or to provide security directly?

Obviously, I will not make much progress in answering these questions, but I hope at least to illuminate the questions by identifying some difficult issues that need addressing if they are to be answered.

## **I. The Philosophy of Human Rights: Forget it!**

There has recently been extensive philosophical discussion about the nature of human rights. I think that philosophers should not continue this debate—they lack the tools to make progress with it, and the debate is in itself unimportant.

The language of human rights has great currency in international politics and law, and for that reason it should not be abandoned by activists, politicians, and lawyers: in politics and law precision is less important than results. Abandoning the language of human rights would probably set back the ability of activists to prevent injustice, protect others from harm, and so on. Retaining a poor discourse is a small price to pay in the face of these ambitions. There is little point, though, in philosophical reflection on political and legal discourses to work out what conception of human rights fits the practice best. Here are two reasons why.

## **A.╇ Which discourse? Who cares?**

First, the question 'what is a human right?' has a non-stipulative answer only if there is a dominant discourse of human rights with a certain degree of coherence in its use of the concept of a human right. I suspect that there is no single dominant discourse. The features that are treated as essential for a right to be a human right are likely to differ across discourses (and perhaps within them). Even if I am wrong about these things, philosophers have not done the work necessary to establish what the dominant discourse of human rights is, or what features of a right make it a human right in that discourse. And they lack the skills to do that. Finally, even if they could do that, there would be little point in doing it. For the way in which we draw the distinction between human rights and other rights lacks normative implications.

I agree with Joseph Raz that a theory of human rights should have the following ambitions '(a) to establish the essential features which contemporary human rights practice attributes to the rights it acknowledges to be human rights; and (b) to identify the moral standards which qualify anything to be so acknowledged.'2 Before carrying out the normative project of determining what we have human rights to, in other words, we ought to do the interpretative work of establishing what people mean when they refer to human rights.

Unlike Raz, I think the interpretative project is unpromising. The language of human rights has been used and developed in various different ways in different contexts, for different political goals, and by agents with different roles and responsibilities. Different conceptions of human rights will tend to further different political projects in different ways, resulting in significant variation in the way the term is used.

There are many disputes about the concept of a human right that we could focus on. Let me focus only on the following claim:

*International Enforcement*: D has a human right to *x* only if states or international organizations ought to be permitted to interfere with sovereign states to protect D's right to *x*.

Whether *International Enforcement* is true is a matter of dispute. How should this dispute be resolved?

John Rawls and Joseph Raz are prominent defenders of *International Enforcement*.3 Raz argues for this view as follows: 'the dominant trend in human rights practice is to take the fact that a right is a human right as a defeasibly sufficient ground for taking action against violators in the international arena'.4 I agree with Raz that in order to understand the concept of human rights, if it is possible to do so, we should identify the dominant trend in human rights practice. How successful is Raz's argument for *International Enforcement* in the light of this?

One problem is that Raz's argument is far too vague to be assessable. What is 'dominant trend of human rights practice'? What is 'the international arena'? And, perhaps most importantly, what 'actions' are governed by human rights? Actions might include war, trade sanctions, public condemnation, decisions to prefer other trading partners, decisions to enter certain political arrangements (for example, accession to the European Union depends on human rights compliance), and so on. On which kinds of interference does the existence of human rights depend?5

For more on this methodological constraint, see J. Tasioulas, 'Human Rights', in A. Marmor (ed.), *The Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Law* (New York: Routledge, 2011), 350–1.

5 Rawls' list of human rights is extremely limited in part because he thought that human rights violations were grounds for war. He provides no evidence for his unlikely view that this is the way in which human rights have been conceived of in the international arena since the Second World War. See Rawls,

#### *Victor Tadros* 445

Let us suppose that Raz's argument has been specified in some way or another. However it is specified, others, such as James Griffin,6 Amartya Sen,7 and John Tasioulas,8 disagree with Rawls and Raz. They think that the idea of human rights includes very important rights regardless of whether international actors have a permission to intervene in sovereign states to protect these rights. Who is right?

Given Raz's first ambition for a theory of human rights, this depends on the answer to an empirical question—which account best tracks the ordinary discourse of human rights. Raz provides no evidence to support *International Enforcement*. His opponents mostly fail to provide any real evidence against it.9 They sometimes point to the fact that people make human rights claims without recognizing the restriction advocated by Rawls and Raz. But this fact is hardly decisive—people often misuse language, and, as we will see in a moment, there are powerful reasons to use the language of human rights even where that language might not be apt.

What theorists of human rights require, then, is a convincing account of what the dominant discourse of human rights is, and an empirical investigation of the conception of human rights in this discourse. I suspect, though, that little progress can be made in this investigation. I suspect there is no dominant discourse of human rights, but rather a lot of vague and conflicted human rights talk, developed in different ways in different social, political, and institutional contexts.

Here is why my suspicion is likely well founded. Human rights language is a very powerful tool. It is used by those who develop and interpret legal and political instruments, in the course of political argument in both the domestic and international arena, by activists in furthering their causes, and so on. There is little reason to think that people in all of these different contexts understand the concept in the same way. Some, perhaps mainly those working in the international arena, are concerned to ensure that certain legal instruments are acceptable to a range of people with different ethical views and cultural heritages. For others, for example activists fighting for a cause within their own community, this issue is unimportant. For some, the discourse of human rights is developed in particular national or international legal contexts, where questions of legitimacy and enforcement naturally arise. Others discuss human rights independently of these contexts.

*The Law of Peoples*, 79, and for criticism, J. Griffin, *On Human Rights* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 24 (though Griffin's own views seem no better defended than Rawls').

- 6 Griffin, *On Human Rights*.
- 7 A. Sen, 'Elements of a Theory of Human Rights', *Philosophy and Public Affairs*, 32 (2004): 315.
- 8 Tasioulas, 'Human Rights'.

9 Eg, James Griffin claims that his 'bottom up' approach 'starts with human rights as used in our actual social life by politicians, lawyers, social campaigners, as well as theorists of various sorts, and then sees what higher principles one must resort to in order to explain their moral weight, when one thinks they have it, and to resolve conflicts between them' (*On Human Rights*, 29). But he does almost nothing to investigate how politicians, lawyers, or social campaigners use the language of human rights in ordinary discourse. Similarly, Charles Beitz, in *The Idea of Human Rights* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), claims to explore the practice of human rights in depth, but provides almost no evidence for his neutralist account of human rights. He relies mostly on claims about the intentions of those who framed significant human rights documents post-Second World War, who aimed for international agreement on basic standards. But even if Beitz is right about these intentions (and he provides very little evidence for his claim) it is difficult to see why these intentions are decisive, given that others have taken up the language of human rights with other ambitions, and without a concern for international agreement.

Even within different groups, there is likely to be little uniformity in the way in which the concept is understood. Human rights activists aim to achieve a variety of goals. These include ensuring that states comply with duties they have not to wrong their citizens, but also ensuring that powerful international actors are restricted in the power that they have. Activists focused on the first ambition will tend not to be focused on *International Enforcement*. Activists focused on the second ambition will take *International Enforcement* much more seriously. The discourse of neither activist seems dominant. Hence, the question whether *International Enforcement* is true is inapt. It is true in some important human rights discourses but not in others.

To illustrate the point, consider the right to security. Activists fighting for their state to protect some of its citizens against serious violence when the state is allowing them to be harmed will claim that the human rights of their citizens are being violated. As the language of human rights has a great deal of power, couching their claims in the language of human rights helps to secure their goals. These activists will be uninterested, in mounting this challenge to their states, in the question of international interference. Furthermore, it would surely be inadequate for the state in question to respond to these activists by denying that it is violating the human rights of its citizens on the grounds that international interference to compel the state adequately to protect its citizens would be unwarranted. This response would be inappropriate even if it had arguments to support the view that international interference would indeed be unwarranted. The question of international interference, in this context, is irrelevant.

Other activists are concerned about the over-zealous pursuit of security by their states, and international pressure to achieve security. They have powerful reasons to resist or limit the use of the language of a human right to security. For if there is an unrestricted human right to security, states will have greater ability to secure their security driven and authoritarian ends by claiming that they are advancing human rights. And national and international institutions and agents will be more likely to pressure states into pursuing security at the cost of other rights. For example, international recognition of a right of security may lead to rights against state interference being balanced against this right. And international pressure to improve security may further erode the legal rights of individuals against their states. Activists in this context thus have reasons to limit the use of human rights language by endorsing *International Enforcement*.

We should expect, then, that different discourses of security and human rights will come apart with respect to their use of the concept of a human right. As neither discourse just identified seems dominant, there is no reason to favour or to reject *International Enforcement*.

Perhaps someone will make a real advance in this debate by providing an argument that there is a dominant discourse of human rights, and by doing the empirical work that one must do to establish what that discourse implies about the concept of human rights. Frankly, I find it hard to see why anyone would bother to do this. Whether *International Enforcement* is true has no important normative implications. The truth or falsity of *International Enforcement* cannot tell us about the importance of a right, how that right should be protected, what its moral foundations are, or anything else of any interest. It can tell us only whether we should call that right a human right, and there really isn't much reason to care about that. The best answer to the conceptual question will not even provide a powerful reason to influence the discourse of human rights lawyers and activists. Where people might help to secure justice with respect to torture, free speech, fair trials and so on, who cares whether they are abusing language?

When it comes to normative philosophical work, we are better avoiding the difficult and probably unanswerable question of the best conception of human rights. As moral and political philosophers, assuming that we have little or no influence over real world events, or that our influence is very difficult to predict, we can do so at little expected cost. We can then move more directly to the normative issues that should provide our primary focus.

#### **B.╇ What's so special about being human?**

A second reason to abandon the philosophy of human rights is that the term 'human rights' wrongly implies that it is in virtue of being human that we have the rights that we have. I doubt that we have any of the rights that we have in virtue of being human, and even if we do, being human is not the property that we have that is most fundamental in explaining why we have these rights.

Many theories of human rights begin with an attempt to establish what is essential about human life that gives human life or activity its value, importance or moral significance. Tasioulas summarizes this basic idea, which is pervasive in the literature, as follows:

Human rights are distinguished from other moral rights because we possess them not due to any personal achievement, social status or transaction, nor because they are conferred upon us by a positive legal order, but simply in virtue of our standing as human beings.10

I doubt we have *any* rights in virtue of our standing as human beings. It is the properties that typical humans have that ground their rights rather than the fact that they are humans. Non-humans that have these properties have the same rights. Some, but only some, of these properties are exclusive to humans. And not all humans have all right-grounding properties.

It may be objected to this that humans who lack the relevant properties nevertheless retain rights that are grounded in properties that are exclusive to humans. Compare individual humans and individual non-human animals that have the same degree of intelligence, end setting power, and so on. Do they not have different rights? Perhaps. It might be argued to follow that these humans have some rights in virtue of being human. Again, perhaps.

The argument seems to rest on the following idea. Suppose that an individual, X, is a member of a species, S. Typical members of S have certain properties that ground

<sup>10</sup> Tasioulas, 'Human Rights', 348.

certain duties that are owed to those members. If so, these duties are also owed to X even if X lacks the properties just identified. There are different variations on this idea. On a narrower view, only those who are also members of S owe the relevant duties to X. On a broader view, anyone owes the relevant duties to X. The broader view strikes me as more plausible—if human beings owe special duties to humans who lack significant agential capacities, so do non-human intelligent aliens.

The general view that species membership is morally significant in this way is difficult to defend. Why should it matter, in determining what rights one has, whether typical members of one's species have certain properties if one lacks those properties? The rights that are distinctive to humans are held by humans in virtue of the special agential capacities that humans have. If that is so, why should it not also be true that whether a particular human has these rights depends on whether that human has these agential capacities?

Furthermore, the view that species membership matters has counterintuitive implications. Suppose that due to some ecological disaster, most human beings were born without the relevant properties. Would these human beings then lack human rights? Suppose, in contrast, that many dolphins suddenly acquire the relevant properties. Does that mean that all dolphins suddenly acquire more rights? Why should the respective rights of particular humans or dolphins depend on how many other humans or dolphins have the agential properties that are required to ground certain rights?

Even if being human is sufficient to give rise to certain special rights, though, the rights that all humans have are held in virtue of other properties that humans typically have, such as their agential capacities. It is not because humanness is itself especially important that all humans have these rights. Were most dolphins to gain the relevant agential capacities, and species membership is morally significant, all dolphins would also acquire these rights.

Perhaps the human species is the only species that has any members that have the properties that ground certain rights. Perhaps these rights are the most important rights. I certainly agree that the special properties that most humans have makes them especially important, and grounds certain rights that non-human animals all lack. I doubt that this is good enough reason to restrict our focus to them. Even if non-human animals lack some of the most important rights that humans have, they nevertheless have very important rights.

We even lack a good reason to focus exclusively on humans if we restrict our attention to those rights that can be enforced internationally. International interference is surely permitted, and perhaps required, in order to enforce duties owed by state officials to non-human animals, at least in the form of international condemnation and monetary sanctions. It follows from this that the right to security extends to non-human animals. It is permissible for international organizations to condemn, and perhaps sanction, states that offer insufficient protection to non-human animals against being wronged by citizens of those states. As state officials have positive duties to non-human animals to protect them against being harmed severely, non-human animals have a right to security. The right to security is thus also not best conceived of as a distinctively human right.

## **II. Important Rights**

In the light of these doubts I will focus on important rights rather than on human rights. Humans and non-human animals may hold some of these rights. Here are some distinctions between important rights that will help to focus our discussion:

- *Important Rights*: Rights that there are powerful reasons to respect in virtue of the moral importance of the right holder.
- *Important Rights to State Action*: Important rights that ground duties on state officials, or duties to take certain actions by developing or utilizing state institutions.
- *Important Constitutional Rights*: Important rights that grounds duties that ought (under some conditions, and in some way) to be enshrined in the state's constitution.
- *Important International Rights*: An important right that grounds a permission or duty of international interference, in some ways to be specified.

Let us first focus on the intentionally vague definition of important rights.

### **A.╇ Interpreting the right**

The fact that a subject, X, has a right to p does not derive simply from the fact that it is important to X that p.11 X has a right to p only if someone has (or perhaps someone will or may have) a duty to ensure that p. A right is important if it is important that the duty is fulfilled.

For a right to be important, in the sense that I intend, the importance of fulfilling the duty must be in virtue of the moral importance of the right-holder. There may be duties that it is important to fulfill for other reasons—for example, the integrity of the duty-holder or the interests of those other than the right-holder. The fact that fulfilling the duty is important for these reasons does not render the right important in the intended sense.

I have not outlined what makes fulfilling duties important. Some people—interest theorists—think (roughly) that rights are grounded in interests. They will claim that the importance of a right is normally a function of the importance of the interest which grounds it. Others—will theorists—think (roughly) that rights are grounded in the provision of choices to people. They will claim that the importance of a right is normally a function of the importance of the right holder having these choices. I think that different rights are grounded in different ways—some are grounded in interests, others are grounded in respect for autonomy.12 Hence, I think that different rights may be important for different reasons.

<sup>11</sup> See, further, Raz, 'Human Rights Without Foundations', 326.

<sup>12</sup> To understand why, see V. Tadros, 'Harm, Sovereignty and Prohibition', *Legal Theory*, 17 (2001): 35.

#### **B.╇ Shue's thesis**

In the light of these clarifications, how important is the right to security? Henry Shue believes that there is an important distinction between the rights that protect things that we require to make any other rights worth having—what he calls basic rights—and the rights that protect things that are not valuable in this way.13 Because enjoying other rights depends on the enjoyment of the right of security, Shue thinks, the right to security is basic. Basic rights, Shue claims, take priority over non-basic rights.

I doubt that Shue is right. A right may be very important even if no other rights depend on it. For Shue, my right to security is basic because being murdered, raped, and beaten prevents me enjoying any of my other rights. But the moral significance of my right against being murdered, raped, and beaten does not depend on whether my enjoyment of other rights depends on my not being murdered, raped, and beaten. Being treated in these ways may affect my enjoyment of my other rights, but that is not the most significant reason why these rights are important.14

Furthermore, Shue relies on the following more general claim:

*Shue's Thesis*: If everyone has a right to y, and the enjoyment of x is necessary for the enjoyment of y, everyone has a right to x.15

One concern with *Shue's Thesis* is that it is difficult to know what Shue means by the 'enjoyment' of a right. Shue explains that he means that a person enjoys the thing that the right protects whilst being conscious that it is protected as a right.16 However, rights, or the things that rights protect, are not important primarily because having them is enjoyable, so Shue cannot mean 'enjoyment' literally. But if that is not what is meant, what is meant?

Perhaps a person enjoys a right, for Shue, if the good that the right protects is in fact realized. But this wrongly treats the normative significance of rights exclusively in the goods that rights protect. The falsity of this view is demonstrated by the fact that I have a right to sacrifice myself for the sake of others, and a right that others don't interfere with me to prevent me from doing so. The importance of my right to sacrifice myself for the sake of others is not that self-sacrifice is good for me. Without a clearer indication of what enjoyment means, Shue's claim is difficult to assess.

*Shue's Thesis* also seems too demanding (as Shue himself is aware). Suppose that I am about to be killed by natural causes and nothing can be done about that. It seems false that I have a right to be protected from this disaster given that nothing can be done about it. And *Shue's Thesis* seems to offer too little protection against interference

<sup>13</sup> H. Shue, *Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and US Foreign Policy*, 2nd edn. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), 19.

<sup>14</sup> Shue also fails to recognize that even the most basic rights protect goods that come in degrees, and hence a degree of protection may be sacrificed for the sake of other less basic rights. See, further, J. Waldron 'Security as a Basic Right (After 9/11)', in *Global Basic Rights* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).

<sup>15</sup> Shue, *Basic Rights*, 32. 16 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 15.

to those who cannot enjoy rights. Suppose that I am about to be killed by a natural disaster. Another person kills me at just that time. This person violates my rights. But in killing me he does not deprive me of enjoyment of any of my rights, for I was about to be killed anyway.

There are various non-trivial variations on Shue's thesis that are worth considering. For example:

*Shue's Thesis (Equivalence)*: If everyone has a right to *y*, grounding a duty on others not to *v*, and the enjoyment of *x* is necessary for the enjoyment of *y*, everyone has a duty to provide *x* that is as stringent as the duty not to *v*.

This thesis is non-trivial and not *obviously* false. It is, nevertheless, false. It is false because negative duties are typically more stringent than positive duties.

First, let me specify what I mean by stringency. The stringency of a duty depends on the costs that the duty holder must bear to ensure that he complies with the duty, or that are sufficient to vitiate the duty. For example, I have a duty to rescue others at some cost to myself. The stringency of the duty depends on the costs that are sufficient to vitiate the duty. Compare:

*Weak Demand*: X, an innocent bystander, has a duty to rescue Y, an innocent person who is threatened with harm, if in doing so X will not be harmed, or will be harmed to a degree significantly less severe than the harm that he will prevent Y from suffering.

*Strong Demand*: X, an innocent bystander, has a duty to rescue Y, an innocent person who is threatened with harm, if in doing so X will not be harmed, or will be harmed to a degree that is less severe than the harm that he will prevent Y from suffering.

Those who endorse *Weak Demand* believe that the duty of rescue is less stringent than those who endorse *Strong Demand*.

Stringency and importance are different dimensions of rights, and they must not be confused. The stringency of a duty is a function of the costs on the duty-bearer that must be borne to fulfill the duty. The importance of a duty is a function of the value that will be set back if the duty is not fulfilled. The duty to rescue a person from a lethal threat is not very stringent. But it is very important. The duty not to break a person's arm is very stringent, but may be less important.

To see this, notice how difficult it is to justify breaking an arm—one is justified in doing this only if one will bear a significantly greater cost if one does not do so. In contrast, one is permitted to refrain from saving a life if doing so will impose on one some much lesser cost, perhaps less than a broken arm. In contrast, however, it is much more important that the duty to rescue a person from a lethal threat is performed than the duty not to break a person's arm. If a third party could ensure that only one of these duties is fulfilled, he ought to ensure that the duty to rescue a person from a lethal threat is fulfilled.

One explanation for Shue's error in roughly equating positive and negative duties is his failure to distinguish the importance of a duty from its stringency. He believes that those who strongly contrast negative and positive duties are making claims about the relative importance of these duties. Were that true, his objection would be valid. However, the contrast may not be in virtue of the importance of these duties but rather in virtue of their stringency.17

In other words *Shue's Thesis (Equivalence)* implies the falsity of important non-consequentialist principles such as the *Doctrine of Doing and Allowing* (DDA) and the *Means Principle* (MP). The DDA holds that the duty against harming others is more stringent than the duty to prevent others from being harmed. MP holds that there is an especially stringent duty not to use people as a means to the greater good. If DDA and MP are stringent principles, *Shue's Thesis* is false.

If MP is valid, it is wrong to torture one person as a means of preventing two other people from being tortured. It does not follow, though, that the duty to ensure that others will not be tortured is very stringent. Although the duty not to torture is very stringent, MP does not imply that there are especially strong reasons to prevent torture. For failing to prevent the torture occurring does not itself use the person tortured as a means. It may be wrong to fail to prevent the torture occurring in order that the torture will have good consequences—that would wrongly treat the one person as a means.18 But it would not be wrong to fail to prevent the torture occurring in order to save two innocent people, unconnected to the torture, from being killed.

Even if MP is accepted, it might be argued that there are especially strong reasons to prevent rights being violated—much stronger reasons than there are to prevent people being harmed. Hence, in my earlier example, there would be a duty to prevent the torture even if two other innocent people could be saved if these other people are saved from natural disaster rather than wrongdoing. Shue rejects this view, and I think that he is right to do so.

Consider:

*HIV*: There is a queue of children who have been infected with HIV. Only some of these children can receive retroviral drugs to prevent the development of AIDS. Some have been intentionally infected in order to kill them. Others have been infected as a result of the unjust policies of their state, which fails to provide them with contraception. Others have been infected by chance, and not as a result of injustice.

If there were a significantly stronger reason to prevent rights violations than there is to prevent killing by natural disaster, there would be a strong reason to push those who have wrongfully been infected to the front of the queue. Doing so would prevent the right to life of these children being violated. But it is unintuitive that there is any strong reason of this kind. Any such reason seems insufficiently powerful to provide those who have wrongfully been infected with a greater chance of survival than those who were infected by chance.19 This, though, does not show that there is no important

17 He is somewhat unclear about the Doctrine of Doing and Allowing (DDA)—he appears to recognize that it might be important, notes that it cuts across security from wrongdoing and subsistence, but then fails to draw conclusions about whether positive and negative duties on the state are equally stringent. See Shue, *Basic Rights*, 35–40.

18 See, also, the *Guinea Pig* case, in which one person is allowed to die of a disease so that more can people can later be cured of it, discussed in W. Quinn, 'Actions, Intentions and Consequences: The Doctrine of Double Effect', in *Morality and Action* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993), 177.

<sup>19</sup> See, further, J. McMahan, 'Humanitarian Intervention, Consent, and Proportionality' and P. Singer, 'Bystanders to Poverty', both in N.A. Davis, R. Keshen, and J. McMahan (eds.), *Ethics and Humanity: Themes from the Philosophy of Jonathan Glover* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010) and

difference in the stringency between negative and positive duties, only that our positive duties to protect people against negative duties being violated are no more important than our positive duties to protect people against being harmed.

#### **III. State Security**

A further question is whether duties of security are enforceable, and if so by whom. It seems clear that some positive duties are enforceable. The enforceability of a duty, I think, depends primarily on its importance rather than on its stringency. The fact that some will die or suffer serious injuries if duties of security are not fulfilled supports the claim that they are enforceable.

Libertarians doubt this. Some deny that there are positive duties. Others deny that positive duties are enforceable. Neither view is at all plausible. Consider an extreme case. Suppose that you could prevent very many people from being killed by a nuclear weapon simply by pressing a button. Pressing the button will cost you nothing. Obviously, you have a duty to press the button. Obviously, also, it would not be wrong for me to force you to do this if I could do so at little cost to anyone else. In fact, I am surely required to force you to do this.

What role does the state have with respect to duties of security? Some claim that a distinctive property of a human right is that it is a right held against a state. Charles Beitz, for example, claims that 'states have the primary or "first level" responsibility to ensure the satisfaction of the human rights of their own residents.'20 This idea is reflected in human rights law—cases before the European Court of Human Rights designate states as the duty-holders.

Beitz's view relies on the idea that states can be duty-holders. We might doubt this idea. One reason to doubt it is that only responsible agents can be duty-holders, and states are not agents. It seems difficult to resist the claim that only responsible agents can be duty-holders. Perhaps it is easier to resist the claim that states are not responsible agents. Some may claim that states are collective agents, and perhaps collective agents can be responsible agents. It is not completely clear to me when a state meets the conditions of collective agency, if ever. Perhaps some do. I doubt that all do.

If not all states are collective agents the view that human rights are rights against states has absurd implications. Suppose, as is likely, that some states are too chaotic and disorganized to meet the conditions of responsible collective agency. These states are amongst those that are most likely to harbour officials who perpetrate very serious moral wrongs against their citizens in carrying out state functions. As these states are not responsible collective agents, they cannot be duty-holders. Hence, the view that human rights are rights held against states implies that citizens of these states lack human rights. Hence, the view that human rights are rights held against states implies that the human rights of citizens who are subject to serious wrongdoing by officials

are not being violated. Even if we should retain philosophical interest in human rights, this implication is unwelcome.

This brief argument also supports the more general conclusion that we should not distinguish rights on the basis of whether they are held against states—if the state–citizen relationship is important, its importance does not depend on whether the state is a responsible collective agent. We should replace the idea that citizens have special rights against states with a better idea: citizens have a distinctive right against certain individuals, grounding certain duties, where fulfilling these duties is to be done in the name of the state, and through certain state institutions or mechanisms. The phrase 'a duty of the state to provide its citizens with security' is better understood as a set of duties that citizens owe to each other both in their private and their official capacities that can best be realized by developing, sustaining and utilizing state institutions, capacities, techniques, and so on.

I won't examine the sources of these duties in any detail. There is a duty of easy rescue that citizens owe to each other simply in virtue of the fact that there is a duty of easy rescue that all people owe to all others. One way to satisfy that duty is to fund state activities that ensure high levels of security, including education, policing, a decent physical environment, and so on. It may be that citizens have stronger duties than this to each other in virtue of shared citizenship, the collective production of resources, and so on. These facts may enhance the stringency of the right to security. But there is a powerful right to security held against the state regardless of citizenship that is grounded in the duty to rescue.

A further question concerns the stringency and importance of the special state duties that I identified earlier. Are they different in kind, stringency, and importance when compared with duties that individuals owe to each other, other things being equal? Do familiar non-consequentialist principles, such as DDA and MP, apply equally to state officials working in their official capacities as they do to individuals acting privately?

If the DDA and MP are valid, I believe that they are also valid for state officials acting in their official capacities. Whilst some doubt it,21 there is little reason to believe that there is some kind of 'moral magic' of the state that renders these principles invalid with respect to state action. That is also the intuitive view. For example, suppose that if one state official, Officer X, tortures A to get information another official, Officer Y will refrain from wrongly torturing B and C to get the same information. Overall, fewer tortures will occur if Officer X acts. Furthermore, fewer tortures will have been committed in the name of the state if X acts. Yet it seems wrong for X to torture A.22 This is so even though Officer Y will also be acting in the name of the state, and hence that the state will have violated fewer rights if Officer X tortures A than if he does not.

<sup>21</sup> Some people believe that the DDA and MP, even if they are valid, do not apply to states. See, eg, C. Sunstein and A. Vermeule, 'Is Capital Punishment Morally Required? Acts, Omissions, and Life-Life Tradeoffs', *Stanford Law Review*, 58 (2005): 703 and D. Enoch, 'Intending, Foreseeing, and the State', *Legal Theory*, 13 (2007): 69. This is clearly false, though explaining why is beyond the scope of this paper. For rebuttals of various arguments concerning the DDA, see A.O. Hosein, 'Doing, Allowing, and the State', *Law and Philosophy*, 33 (2014): 235.

<sup>22</sup> Things are different if A will also be tortured by Officer Y. In that case, the harm to A is overdetermined.

Here is another issue. Suppose that Officer X could either prevent Officer Y from torturing A or prevent a private citizen, Z, from torturing B. The tortures will be identical in seriousness and will be done for identical reasons with identical results. Does Officer X have a more important duty to prevent the torture by Officer Y than the torture by Z? Perhaps the latter duty is somewhat less important than the former. I doubt that this difference is very profound. Again, it seems that the fact that some act will be conducted in the name of the state does not affect its moral significance in any profound way.

Some may doubt this on the grounds that it is worse for a person to be harmed by a person who has a duty to protect her.23 Others may doubt it on the grounds that there are much stronger reasons to prevent torture in the name of the state, and especially in the name of the state of which one is a state official, than there are to prevent torture by private citizens. I agree that there is some force in these ideas. But I think that their force is insufficient to justify a duty to protect A rather B. We will return to the implications of this idea for obligations of international actors later.

To summarize: there is an enforceable right of security that is held between individuals. It is grounded in the duty to rescue, and perhaps it has other sources in the special duties of protection that citizens owe against each other. The duties of officials to protect people against wrongdoing by officials acting in their official capacities are not much more important than the duties of officials to protect people against wrongdoing by private citizens.

#### **IV. Constitutionalizing the Right to Security**

Let us now focus on the constitutional question, which is Liora Lazarus's main focus. As there are many different ways in which a right may be 'constitutionalized' the idea of an important constitutional right admits many variations. There are many different ways of dividing labour for the scrutiny and legal protection of important rights. Rights might form part of the written constitution of a particular state. Alternatively, they may form part of an international agreement, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), or the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), that states are signatories to. And there are different roles that courts (national and cross national) and legislatures might be given in ensuring that these rights are adhered to.

In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, courts are given the power to strike down legislation that is deemed incompatible with constitutional arrangements. In others, such as the United Kingdom, courts only have interpretative and declaratory powers. There might also be constitutional arrangements that articulate what important rights citizens have, but which give no role to courts in enforcing these rights.

Jeremy Waldron dissents from the last claim. He thinks it inevitable that courts lead the way in shaping constitutional rights.24 Waldron, though, is guilty of a lack

<sup>23</sup> See J. Gardner, 'Criminals in Uniform', in R.A. Duff, L. Farmer, S.E. Marshall, M. Renzo, and V. Tadros (eds.), *The Constitution of the Criminal Law* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).

<sup>24</sup> J. Waldron, 'A Right-Based Critique of Constitutional Rights', *Oxford Journal of Legal Studies*, 13 (1993): 18, 41–6.

of institutional imagination. It is perfectly feasible for a body such as the United Kingdom's Joint Committee for Human Rights to scrutinize constitutional rights compliance and report to the legislature without the involvement of courts. Reports by non-judicial bodies might be important only in guiding and structuring debate by legislatures. Some may claim that this will inevitably result in weak protection of rights. I doubt that this is inevitable. Constitutional rights compliance depends as much on political culture as it does on institutional arrangements.

In defending claims about the proper constitutional arrangement to protect rights, we must attend both to empirical and principled questions. One important question concerns the rights that citizens have to shape their own institutions and laws. More important is the question of which institutional arrangement will best protect important rights that citizens have that are less closely connected to democracy, such as the right to life, or the right to a family life. Because the instrumental question is largely empirical I will not aim to make progress with it here. Again, much will depend on the particular qualities that legislatures have and the possibility of improving them when compared with other institutional arrangements including court scrutiny of legislation.

With respect to the right to security, I tend to think that instrumental considerations are paramount. In assessing the rightness of any action that is at some risk of seriously affecting others, including the action of law making, we must attend to the consequences of the action to determine whether it is justified and proportionate. That will turn on the relationship between the values that we are pursuing and the harms that we will do and prevent in pursuing those values. It will typically be disproportionate to do or allow violations of important rights such as the right against being tortured, killed, raped, wrongfully imprisoned, in order to adhere to less important democratic rights.

I am very skeptical about a constitutional right to security in the light of this concern, at least in the UK context. And I suspect that the same concern is valid for other developed countries. The skepticism stems from a concern that I share with Lazarus and many others. The risk of modern developed countries being insufficiently zealous in providing security to their citizens in order to protect civil liberties is remote. A constitutional right to security will almost certainly enhance the overzealous response to threats from offending, and especially the threat of terrorism. A constitutional right to security will, in this way, do less well in promoting security—security from the state will be eroded with little advance in security from criminal wrongdoing. For this reason, I am glad that the right to security is not given an important role in the ECHR—not because the right to security is less important than other rights, but because of the detrimental effects of giving the right a more significant constitutional status in practice.

Perhaps things are different in other contexts where states are poor at providing security to many of their citizens. In those contexts, it might be argued, whilst there may still be risks that a constitutional right to security will be used to erode civil liberties, if the right constitutional arrangements are in place a right to security might also be used by the vulnerable to enhance the state protection to which they are entitled. Again, everything depends on answers to empirical questions that I am ill placed to provide, but Lazarus's chapter has reinforced my skepticism about the constitutionalization of the right to security in these contexts as well.

## **V. International Interference: Ought Implies Can, not Will**

To what extent should other states and international organizations have the power to enforce the right to security against the wishes of the duty holding state officials? We can ask this question about the here and now: to what extent, under current imbalances of power in the international arena, ought states, through their officials, to be permitted to interfere with decisions of other states in order to secure important rights? Or we can ask it in a more idealistic way. Suppose that there was a more ideal set of international institutions. To what extent should such institutions be used to enforce important human rights?

As I noted earlier, Raz endorses *International Enforcement*. His version of *International Enforcement*, though, is especially problematic. He claims:

- (1) 'Human rights are those regarding which sovereignty-limiting measures are justified';25 and
- (2)The moral limits of state sovereignty 'are determined not merely by the moral limits to the authority of states but also by the possibility of morally sound interference'.26

On this view, the extent to which a person has human rights is sensitive to fact that we wish to restrict the power of international organizations. Raz puts it like this: 'When the international situation is one in which it is clear that international measures will not be implied impartially, that they will be used to increase the domination of a super-power over its rivals, or over its client states, etc. the moral principles setting limits to sovereignty will tend to be more protective of sovereignty.'27

Raz's view thus has the following unappealing implication.

- (3) Given (2), the worse the dispositions and tendencies of international actors, the more limited the permission to interfere with state sovereignty.
- (4) Given (1) and (3), the worse the dispositions and tendencies of international actors, the fewer human rights people have.

The implication that our human rights depend on the bad dispositions of others cannot be accepted. The fact that international actors cannot be trusted with the task of protecting rights because of their colonial or exploitative ambitions cannot render these rights non-existent. The ordinary discourse of human rights may be incoherent, but no one thinks *that*.

To illustrate the problem, suppose that some state, X, can interfere with some other state, Y, in a way that would protect the citizens of Y against serious violations of their rights. This will be at little cost to the citizens of X, or anyone else. However, if X does

- 25 Raz, 'Human Rights Without Foundations', 329.
- 26 Raz, 'Human Rights Without Foundations', 331.
- 27 Raz, 'Human Rights Without Foundations', 331–2.

this it will overthrow the government of Y and perpetrate greater violations against the rights of Y's citizens.

There is a sense in which X ought not to interfere with Y's affairs. *Relative to the fact that X will perpetrate greater rights violations against Y's citizens*, X ought not to interfere. But this fact cannot vitiate the rights of the citizens of Y to be protected by X, nor can it vitiate any duty on X to protect Y's citizens. Our moral duties, and the rights to which these duties are related, are not held relative to whether we will tend to go wrong if others have these rights. It vitiates my duty to do something, and hence the right that another person has that it be done, if I *cannot* do that thing. It does not vitiate my duty to do something, and hence the right that another person has that it be done, that I *will* not do it.

Similarly, the fact that states will tend to go wrong if they interfere in the affairs of other states cannot vitiate their duties to do this, nor can it affect the rights of the citizens of those states. For this reason, when we focus on important international rights, we ought to idealize the international order. The right question to ask, in determining whether people have certain rights against the international community, is not what we expect states to do if we give them the power to interfere. That is a question that we should ask when determining the law, but it is not relevant to determining the moral obligations of officials of a state to the citizens of other states, nor can it affect their rights. The question to ask when determining the rights and duties of citizens to be provided with security is what states *could* do for each other, not what they will in fact do.28

### **Conclusion**

I have only provided a sketch of an exploration of the right to security in the light of a framework for evaluating rights. Whilst many people, like Lazarus, are rightly sceptical about the constitutionalization of the right to security, this should not distract us from the range of important and interesting questions that such a right raises. Although the academic insistence that security from private wrongdoing may come at the expense of security from the state is worth emphasizing and repeating, it ought not to swamp an investigation into the range of other questions that we might ask about the right to security, questions only to be asked when government officials aren't listening.
