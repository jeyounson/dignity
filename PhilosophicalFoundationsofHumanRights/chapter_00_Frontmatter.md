# PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS

#### PHILOSOPHICAL FOU NDATIONS OF LAW

The *Philosophical Foundations of Law* series aims to develop work at the intersection of legal philosophy and doctrinal law. Volumes in the series gather leading philosophers and lawyers to present original work on the theoretical foundations of substantive areas of law, or central topics in legal philosophy. Together, the essays provide a roadmap of current philosophical work in the field to lawyers and philosophers looking for high quality new work and provide a stimulus for further research by specialists in the area.
