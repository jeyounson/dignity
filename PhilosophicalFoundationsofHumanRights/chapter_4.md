#### *Rowan Cruft*

It is natural and appealing to ground human rights in their relation to the good life. Yet many people—perhaps the majority of humans across history—have suffered either from human rights violations (for example, as slaves) or at least from what we might term human rights 'deficits' (for example, those who live or lived in societies that restrict religious worship and political participation). It would be odd, I think, if human rights theory classified every one of these people as unable to attain a good life. While some might well have had their lives blighted by the violations suffered, not all will and some will have recovered following violation, or even found meaning in the violation itself, as a martyr for example.1 So respect for a person's human rights cannot be necessary for that person to have a good life. In addition, many people whose human rights are recognized and respected fail to live good lives due, for example, to miserable personal relationships, thwarted ambitions or major illnesses. So respect for a person's human rights cannot be sufficient for that person to have a good life either. Maybe respect for human rights tends to make a good life more likely, but that could be questioned.

Nonetheless, it would be odd if there was no important relationship between a person's human rights and their living a good life. Without such a relationship, the power and appeal of human rights would be significantly diminished. One of the virtues of Liao's account is that it brings out clearly the complexity of the relationship between human rights and a good life, while still taking the good life as the ultimate ground for such rights. In sections I to IV that follow, I examine Liao's account in order to show that to deliver a standard list of human rights, Liao has to endorse a somewhat controversial liberal commitment to the importance of *a range* of ways of pursuing a good life—and to a somewhat technical notion of *pursuit*. An alternative that avoids these commitments makes the relation between human rights and the good life weak in a way that threatens human rights' special status. At the end of the essay (section V), I show that human rights' recognition-independence means that their grounding cannot proceed in a straightforward way from the value of what they protect: an explanation is needed for why this value grounds rights even when they will not help to secure it. There is a risk that this explanation will leave the good life defined in part as a life

<sup>1</sup> This is not to romanticize suffering. For a case where a violation contributes to a life's success in a sense, see Griffin's discussion of Solzhenitsyn (James Griffin, *On Human Rights* (Oxford University Press, 2008), 46–7).

in which independently grounded human rights are respected, rather than grounding such rights on a separately conceivable notion of the good life. My points do not undermine approaches, like Liao's, which ground human rights on a good life; my aim is rather to sketch the key challenges for such approaches to overcome.

## **I. The Initial Appeal of Grounding Human Rights in a Good Life**

Liao argues that human rights protect the goods, capacities, and options which are necessary for human beings to be able to pursue the basic activities that are important for a good life. A good life, for Liao, means a 'minimally decent life', where this is a life involving 'certain valuable, basic activities'. These basic activities, of which we must enjoy at least some if we are to have a good life, include 'deep personal relationships', 'active pleasures such as creative work and play', and 'passive pleasures such as appreciating beauty'.2 For Liao, a good life need not be an excellent or flourishing life; rather, it is 'minimally' good.

The claimed link between human rights and a minimally good life is appealing. Surely the reason I have human rights is in order to provide some protection for the minimal quality or success of my life, to try to ensure that my life is not blighted. Many theorists—especially those who regard human rights as modern forms of 'natural' or 'basic' rights—similarly ground human rights by their relation to the good life: Tasioulas grounds human rights in part on their holders' interests and he takes an interest, in Raz's words, as an 'aspect of well-being'; Miller's needs-based approach understands right-grounding needs by their relation to harm, which we could understand as a set-back to a good life; a similar link between needs and a good life could be developed in interpreting Renzo; Liao examines Nussbaum's capabilities approach as a rival that derives human rights from a conception of a good life; and even Griffin, who grounds human rights in 'normative agency', can plausibly be read as grounding human rights on one specific aspect of a good human life.3

Liao's account is unusual for keeping the good life to the fore,4 and this is helpful. Liao's concept of the 'fundamental conditions for a good life' seems attractively

James Griffin distances his approach from the notion of a good life (*On Human Rights*, 34), but see Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 86–90, for an explanation of the link between Griffin's approach and the good life. Note that adherents of the 'political' approach to human rights also include a link with the good life: see Beitz's grounding of human rights in 'urgent individual interests' (Charles R. Beitz, *The Idea of Human Rights* (Oxford University Press, 2009), 109) and Raz's conception of human rights as rights and hence, in his terms, as grounded in interests (Joseph Raz, 'Human Rights in the Emerging World Order', this volume, ch. 11).

<sup>4</sup> Nussbaum is similar in this respect.

broader than Griffin's grounding notion of normative agency. Liao argues that conditions necessary for human beings' pursuing the basic activities but which were not necessary for normative agency would nonetheless be plausible grounds for human rights, due to the great importance to a good life of pursuing the basic activities. And Liao similarly argues that his approach can ground status rights and children's rights to good parenting and education (because, he argues, an appropriate status and upbringing are essential to one's being able to pursue some of the activities central to a good life) while Nussbaum's approach cannot easily accommodate rights protecting these aspects of a good life because they are 'best understood as rights to certain functionings rather than rights to certain capabilities'.5 In addition, Liao's position seems helpfully narrower than Tasioulas's pluralist interest-based approach. For Tasioulas human rights are grounded in the interests and dignity of human beings. The interests which ground human rights, for Tasioulas, are those sufficiently important to generate duties despite the burdens they impose, and that ground rights borne universally by all humans in virtue of their humanity.6 One might worry that there is little substantive material in Tasioulas's account (beyond the notions of dignity and the 'in virtue of one's humanity' clause) that can bind together or limit the grounds for human rights. The account might thus seem unhelpfully broad,7 and also difficult to operationalize. By contrast, Liao's approach gives the practitioner a neat, substantive, and seemingly narrow test for whether something is a human right: does it protect one among an adequate range of the conditions whose obtaining is necessary if the right-holder *qua* human being is to be able to pursue one or more basic activities?

## **II. The Intricacy of the Relationship Between Human Rights and a Good Life**

Liao's account uses five concepts—italicized and numbered here—that make the link between human rights and the minimally good life intricate: for Liao, human rights protect (1) an *adequate range* of the (2) *fundamental conditions* that (3) *human beings qua human beings* need in order to (4) *pursue* the (5) *basic activities*. I discuss them in reverse order.

On the relation between the good life and *basic activities*, Liao writes:

[A] characteristically good human life, or a good life, for short, is one spent in pursuing certain valuable, basic activities. 'Basic' activities are activities that are important to human beings *qua* human beings' life as a whole. Sunbathing, for example, is an activity, but is not a basic activity, because a human being *qua* human being's life as a whole is not affected if a human being does not go sunbathing. In addition, activities that are very important to an individual human being's life as a whole may nevertheless not be basic activities, because these activities may not be important to human beings *qua* human beings' life as a whole. For instance, being a professional

<sup>6</sup> Tasioulas, 'On the Foundations of Human Rights'.

<sup>7</sup> Tasioulas would question this charge. See his points about the limits on the interests which can ground human rights, Tasioulas, 'On the Foundations of Human Rights', Section III.

philosopher is very important to my life as a whole. But being a professional philosopher is not a basic activity because it is not an activity that is important to human beings *qua* human beings' life as a whole. [...] Some of the basic activities are as follows: deep personal relationships with, for example, one's partner, friends, parents, children; knowledge of, for example, the workings of the world, of oneself, of others; active pleasures such as creative work and play; and passive pleasures such as appreciating beauty.8

Liao makes clear that a life can be a good life even if it does not contain all the basic activities together. This is plausible: one can have a minimally good life without deep personal relationships, so long as other valuable activities take their place; similarly, I suspect one can have a minimally good life without passive pleasures. So the basic activities are not individually necessary conditions for a minimally good life. They are, rather, disjunctively necessary: important activities such that a life totally devoid of them all could not be a minimally good life.

Liao says that human rights protect the conditions for *pursuit* of the basic activities.9 One can pursue such activities, and thus pursue a good life, without succeeding—for example by pursuing a personal relationship which fails. Perhaps one can sometimes also fall into a basic activity without pursuing it: maybe personal communion with god is not something one can pursue, but something that is bestowed on one if one is lucky. I am unsure about the latter point, but certainly Liao is committed to the former: pursuit is a precondition for rather than a guarantee of one's engaging successfully in a basic activity.

Liao conceives human rights as protecting the conditions for *humans qua humans* to pursue the basic activities. *Qua* individual in a particular context, I might—in order to pursue a particular basic activity—need rather more than what human rights provide. For example, I might need something idiosyncratic: a very sharp eye in order to join the shooting team (my only chance of fellowship), a tiddlywinks set (my only chance of play). Liao makes clear that my human rights protect only what humans need *qua humans* to pursue the basic activities: this will often differ from what a particular contextually situated individual human needs.10

For Liao, human rights protect the *fundamental conditions* for a human *qua* human to pursue the basic activities. These 'fundamental conditions' are necessary conditions, and Liao notes that they will include goods, capacities, and options. While some of these fundamental conditions (perhaps absence of torture) will be 'all purpose means' essential for a human *qua* human to pursue *any basic activity at all rather than none*, others (perhaps the guarantees of fair and equal treatment that Liao mentions) will be necessary conditions for a human *qua* human to pursue *some particular basic activities* and will not be necessary for the pursuit of different basic activities.11

<sup>8</sup> Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 81.

<sup>9</sup> Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 81-3

<sup>10</sup> See Liao's claim that '[t]he fundamental conditions for pursuing a good life are various goods, capacities, and options that *human beings (qua human beings) need, whatever else they (qua individuals) might need*, in order to pursue the basic activities' (Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 81–2 emphasis added).

<sup>11</sup> Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 82.

Finally, Liao adds:

[An] individual's having all the fundamental conditions means that this individual would still have access to an *adequate range* of goods, capacities, and options to pursue those basic activities that are characteristic of a minimally decent human life. This could become important if, for example, this individual changed his/her mind about pursuing a particular kind of good life.12

Thus for Liao an individual's human rights protect an *adequate range* of the fundamental conditions for a human *qua* human to pursue basic activities. Even if I have chosen a basic activity to which some human rights violations seem irrelevant—for example, suppose I am able to pursue my ascetic religious convictions by fasting within a regime that would have starved me anyway—Liao's approach still requires that an adequate range of the goods, capacities, and options necessary for a human *qua* human to pursue basic activities be open to me. Such an adequate range will include the option to eat, even though I have not chosen this.

Liao has moved five steps away from the problematic thesis that respect for any one human right is necessary if the particular right-holder is to live a good life. These moves give us a link between human rights and the right-holder's living a good life, while allowing (i) that many people whose rights are respected will fail to live good lives either because their *pursuit* of basic activities fails or because to pursue these activities they need more in their context than simply what a *human qua human* needs. It also allows (ii) that many people whose rights are violated will still live good lives because despite being denied the conditions necessary to pursue *some* basic activities, they have nonetheless been able successfully to pursue *others*. It might also allow that some people whose rights are violated will nonetheless live good lives by means other than *pursuit* of the basic activities, such as by 'falling into' such activities without pursuing them—though this is controversial. Furthermore, although this is not delivered directly by the five steps I have identified in Liao, it seems likely that Liao would also want to allow that in some cases a person whose rights are violated will nonetheless live a good life because the violation (for example, torture from which one manages to recover) only made impossible pursuit of a basic activity *at a time*, rather than across the right-holder's lifetime.

One might think that Liao's approach also allows victims of rights violations to have lived good lives on the related ground that for Liao human rights offer 'powerful protection'13 for the fundamental conditions, and such protection is not strictly *necessary* for the fundamental conditions to obtain, and hence these conditions can sometimes continue to obtain even when the protection has been violated. I discuss this possibility in section IV. Before this discussion of *how* human rights protect what they protect, I assess Liao's view of *what* human rights protect (namely, the fundamental conditions for a human's pursuit of the basic activities).

## **III. What Human Rights Protect: The Good Life and Liao's Additions**

What makes for a minimally good life—in Liao's terms, what should count as a basic activity—is controversial. Someone committed to the importance of feudal social roles might claim that serfs serving generous lords had a minimally good life; others will disagree. For Liao what is needed is not simply to determine which actual lives have been minimally good, nor what a historically typical minimally good life has involved. Liao's reference to the conditions needed *qua human* for pursuing the basic activities makes clear that he has in mind the kind of minimally good life that our human nature makes possible. Similarly, Tasioulas's right-grounding 'basic interests' will need to be defined by the forms of well-being that our human nature makes possible, and the components of Griffin's 'normative agency' will be determined by what is humanly possible. Such approaches are needed if we are to ground human rights with a critical edge: rights that protect conditions such as political participation, which most actual humans leading actual minimally good lives have failed to attain.

There are epistemic difficulties in deciding whether a given concrete individual has had a minimally good life: we cannot always trust her own judgement on the matter, nor the judgement of third-party expert observers (anthropologists, biologists, sociologists), though such judgements are clearly relevant. These difficulties are magnified when considering the forms of good life that our human nature makes possible: there are risks of conservative bias (for example, human possibilities that are rarely or never played out in actuality might be overlooked) and of a circularity in which entrenched conceptions of what our rights are (for example, the belief in an asymmetry between rights to assistance and rights to non-interference) infect our view of the possible good lives for humans. Some theorists will reject the idea that there are any unifying features to what is picked out by 'the forms of good life possible for humans'.

I do not at present feel I can do much more than report my uncertainty about whether confidence on this issue is justified.14 Nonetheless, it is not clear to me that such concerns threaten Liao's approach *in particular*, nor related approaches like that of Griffin, Miller, Nussbaum or Tasioulas. Our grasp on which forms of minimally good life our nature makes possible is perhaps shaky and views on the matter will be contestable, but I suspect the same is true of alternative fundamental grounds for human rights—for example, what we cannot help presupposing as agents,15 or what would be agreed by hypothetical contractors—and of other areas of moral and political importance such as the nature of legitimate authority.

<sup>14</sup> For confident responses to the worry, see—among many others—Griffin, 'The Relativity and Ethnocentricity of Human Rights', this volume, ch. 31 and Massimo Renzo, 'Human Needs, Human Rights', this volume, ch. 32. For those who are more concerned that there is no unity to the very wide range of forms of good human life, see for example Simon Hope, 'Human Rights without the Human Good? A Reply to Jiwei Ci', this volume, ch. 36, and his use of Clifford Geertz, *Local Knowledge* (Basic Books, 1983).

<sup>15</sup> See Alan Gewirth's approach to human rights (*Reason and Morality* (University of Chicago Press, 1978)).

A further question concerns Liao's claim that human rights protect *an adequate range* of fundamental conditions for a minimally good life. If the importance of living a minimally good life is what ultimately grounds human rights, insisting on providing an 'adequate range' of ways to enable pursuit of such a life can seem unmotivated.16 For example, what should Liao say to a repressive regime which claims that, despite the limitations it imposes on freedom of speech, assembly, and political participation, nonetheless most of its members succeed in living minimally good lives, because most members successfully pursue other life-enhancing basic activities including meaningful employment and personal relationships?17 Liao mentions the possibility that individuals will change their pursuits in such a way that new activities will become central to their having a good life, and perhaps he would claim that by repressing these possibilities for change, the relevant regimes fail properly to respect the good lives of their subjects. But a repressive regime might be correct in predicting that very few of its subjects will wish to engage in the political activities it represses, and it could add that it will take measures to prevent people choosing to engage in such activities. If individuals' having *minimally good lives* is ultimately what grounds human rights, then why should such a regime recognize the civil and political human rights which its subjects do not and will not need for a minimally good life?

By keeping the good life to the fore, Liao makes these questions more pressing than they are for theorists like Tasioulas who pick out particular basic human interests as meriting protection without grounding their importance directly in their relationship to the good life—though a version of the charge could be developed against Tasioulas if one takes the importance of basic interests to derive from their role in a good life. Renzo suggests that such a charge can also be pressed against need-based theories of human rights.18

One response is to maintain that a person does not really have a minimally good life if she lacks an adequate range of the fundamental conditions for pursuit of the basic activities, even if she is nonetheless able to pursue *some* fulfilling basic activities from within her narrow range of options.19 This seems quite attractive, but it amounts to what one might call a 'liberal imperialist' classificatory position according to which most inhabitants of repressive regimes, and thus I would suggest most

16 I set aside the question of whether 'adequate' is question-begging, though this could be pressed.

17 This is one, admittedly disputable, way to understand Lee Kuan Yew's claims about 'Asian values' in relation to his role leading Singapore, and Mahathir Mohamad's similar claims for Malaysia (discussed in Joanne R. Bauer and Daniel A. Bell (eds.), *The East Asian Challenge for Human Rights* (Cambridge University Press, 1999)).

18 Renzo, 'Human Needs, Human Rights', 580.

19 Renzo considers and rejects this reponse in discussing Nickel's suggestion that rape denies one a good life ('Human Needs, Human Rights', 580–1). The idea can be read—perhaps mis-read—into Raz's claim that '[a]utonomy is a constitutive element of the good life' (*The Morality of Freedom*, 408), coupled with his conception of autonomy as requiring the availability of a range of valuable options. Nussbaum can similarly be read as claiming that denial of any one of her ten 'Central Capabilities' denies a person 'human dignity and a life worthy of it' (*Creating Capabilities: the Human Development Approach*, 29 and 32–5) Compare also John Finnis's claim that '[i]f a statesman. . .treats truth or friendship or play or any of the other basic forms of good as of no account, and never asks himself whether his life-plan(s) makes reasonable allowance for participation in those intrinsic human values…, then he can properly be accused. . .of stunting or mutilating himself and those in his care' (*Natural Law and Natural Rights* (Oxford University Press 1980), 106).

humans throughout history, are classified as lacking a minimally good life. Concern about this position is what motivated my questions at the start of the chapter.

An alternative response maintains that if X is the ultimate ground for human rights then, *whatever X is*—whether it is a minimally good life, agency, needs or something else—there is independent reason to regard human rights as protecting a *range* of the fundamental conditions for a human to be able to pursue X. This independent reason might be humans' status as self-determining agents: because we are self-determining agents, our rights should secure us with a range of ways of pursuing the relevant X. This argument—or any other similarly offering independent support for Liao's *range* requirement—will need careful development to ensure that it generates a grounding for an appropriately wide range of rights for every human being.

The latter approach clearly needs more discussion, but my aim for now is simply to show that Liao and similar theorists will need something like the range requirement and that, to avoid the liberal imperialist position, it will need a grounding distinct from the claim that the relevant range is necessary for the right-holder's having a minimally good life. Such a range requirement thus adds something independent to the grounding of human rights, and the load-bearing role of this addition will seem controversial. Why should regimes committed to their subjects' living minimally good human lives be committed to providing a range of ways of so living? To address such doubters, we need an explanation that goes beyond Liao's claim that a range is helpful for those who change their mind, an explanation that can underpin the need for an appropriately wide range for everyone.

Further concerns can be raised about Liao's idea that human rights protect conditions on the *pursuit* of the basic activities, rather than on the basic activities themselves. What criticisms could be levelled at a regime which made sure its citizens engaged in basic activities by somehow directly providing such activities (and thus directly providing 'good lives'), rather than facilitating their *pursuit*? The answer here is that engaging in an activity without pursuing it is impossible for many basic activities (one cannot simply 'fall into' climbing a mountain without pursuing it; indeed successful *achievements* in general seem impossible if they are not pursued), and that for other activities it significantly diminishes their contribution to the quality of the agent's life (pleasant experiences thrust onto one do less for the quality of one's life than those one successfully pursues).

But if this is correct, then taking the good life—or the basic activities which constitute it—directly as the ground for human rights will already ensure that human rights protect *pursuit*, for such pursuit is an indispensable means or even component of many of these activities. Why, then, insist instead that human rights are grounded only on *pursuit* of the good life, rather than directly on the basic activities which constitute a good life? The direct approach will already give pursuit an appropriate prominence.

This question presses particularly hard when one notes that on an ordinary understanding of the term, 'pursuit' of an activity is rather easily achieved. There is a sense in which many captives in prison are *pursuing* freedom, happiness, and a range of other things, even though their pursuit is futile. Similarly, those denied a political voice will often nonetheless *pursue* political participation. If we take 'pursuit' in its broadest sense, there is not much that a human needs *qua* human in order to *pursue*

#### *Rowan Cruft* 109

anything: a will, some lifespan and some awareness might be enough. So even if—as outlined in the previous paragraphs—pursuit is necessary for attaining many aspects of a good life, it is very far from sufficient and simply to protect *pursuit* of the good life is not to protect much. For example, Liao claims that fair and equal treatment in cases of conflict is necessary for a human to be able to pursue the basic activities.20 But someone denied a fair trial, or imprisoned without trial, can still *pursue* any of the basic activities in a sense. It is just that their pursuit will not get far.

One response takes 'pursuit' in a technical manner as a threshold concept, and denies that prisoners or those denied a fair trial meet the threshold for being genuinely able to *pursue* basic activities in the relevant sense. This approach could forestall my concern, though it would leave one wondering how exactly the relevant technical notion is to be delineated: ideas such as 'effective pursuit' or 'pursuit with a reasonable chance of success' might be helpful. However, the approach seems hard to motivate when one remembers that the alternative—to ground human rights directly on the basic activities which constitute a good life—will already ground rights to pursuit where pursuit is important for the relevant basic activity. But it will ground more demanding rights as well, for actual engagement in basic activities is harder to attain than mere pursuit of them.

I suspect Liao will worry that deleting 'pursuit' from his approach—and thus grounding humans rights as protecting an adequate range of the fundamental conditions for a human *qua* human's *engagement in* the basic activities—will make human rights too demanding, turning them into guarantees of a minimally good life. But as noted earlier, in order to engage in a basic activity, a given individual will often need more in her context than that which a human *qua* human needs, so human rights will not guarantee the possibility of such engagement.21 Further, a revised Liao-type approach minus 'pursuit' does not claim that there are rights to *every* condition necessary for humans *qua* humans to engage in basic activities. Some conditions might be excluded from the 'adequate range' because they cannot conceptually qualify as objects of rights.22 Such exclusions, along with the limitation to what *humans qua humans* need, support the thought that deleting 'pursuit' from Liao's approach need not deliver excessively demanding human rights.

### **IV. How Human Rights Protect their Grounds**

My opening concern was how we can ground human rights on the good life without classifying all those suffering human rights deficits as necessarily living a life that is less than minimally good. Liao's intricacies and my proposed adjustments discussed in sections II and III are motivated, in part, as ways of avoiding this problem by denying that human rights are simple necessary conditions for a minimally good life.

<sup>20</sup> Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 84.

<sup>21</sup> It is notable that Liao appeals to the *human qua human* clause, rather than the notion of *pursuit*, in replying to Griffin's charge that Liao-type approaches generate too many human rights (Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', 89–90).

<sup>22</sup> See, eg, Tasioulas's argument that one cannot have a right to romantic love, 'On the Foundations of Human Rights', 59 below, and Miller's similar claim, 'Joseph Raz on Human Right: a critical appraisal', 233 below.

But there is an entirely different response to the problem which is often overlooked or covert in the literature. This is to weaken the link between human rights' content and their grounds to a matter of promotion and support. Such an approach maintains merely that human rights *promote, support* or *make more likely* their holder's living a minimally good life. With a weak link of this type, we can happily recognize that sometimes violations of human rights will not make a minimally good life impossible for right-holders, and that respect for human rights will not guarantee them a minimally good life. For failure to supply something that would promote or support X does not make X impossible or unattainable, and supplying it does not gurarantee X. Thus this route allows us to answer my opening question without needing the complications of section II: human rights are grounded as promoting or supporting their holders' living *minimally good lives* (unqualified by section II's complications), even though violating them does not make minimally good lives impossible for right-holders.

Should Liao—or Griffin, Miller, Nussbaum, Renzo or Tasioulas—take this route, making human rights simply *support* or *make more likely* the vital goods that ground them? I think not. The special status of human rights as important rights that legal systems should recognize whether or not they actually do is inconsistent with calling some right a 'human right' when its fulfilment only *tends to further or promote* the realization of the human-rights-grounding value. Such helpful but unnecessary conditions should not be given the status of rights that legal systems *must* recognize, both because this would leave too little space for culturally specific variation in human rights implementation, and because this would mislead us into thinking that helpful but unnecessary conditions bear the same importance as the grounding conditions that justify them and as the rights more directly justified by these grounding conditions.23

Instead, Liao is correct to assume that human rights' contents are more closely related to their grounds. In particular, human rights will most directly inherit the importance of their grounds if we can follow Liao in accepting that violation of a human right entails that whatever important thing grounds it has not been supplied to the right-holder by the duty-bearers, and that respect for the right entails that it has been so supplied.24 This reopens the need for the complications of section II, for as we have seen, violation of a human right does not entail that a minimally good life is unavailable to the right-holder, nor does respect entail that a minimally good life has been achieved. This is why Liao favours grounding human rights on *an adequate range of fundamental conditions for a human qua human's pursuing the basic activities*. If this

23 For a sophisticated discussion of the related issue of the relative importance of rights that offer inessential but useful support to other rights, see James W. Nickel, 'Rethinking Indivisibility: Towards A Theory of Supporting Relations between Human Rights', *Human Rights Quarterly*, 30 (2008): 984–1001. See also Nickel's suggestion that Henry Shue's idea that basic rights are necessary for 'full enjoyment' of other rights grounds basic rights on a merely supportive relationship of the kind considered (Nickel, *Making Sense of Human Rights*, 2nd edn (Blackwell, 2007), 89, discussing Henry Shue, *Basic Rights: Subsistence, Affluence, and U.S. Foreign Policy*, 2nd edn (Princeton University Press, 1996), 21). For different views on the importance of cultural variation in human rights implementation, see Samantha Besson, 'Human Rights and Constitutional Law: Patterns of Mutual Validation and Legitimation' and Saladin Meckled-Garcia, 'Specifying Human Rights', this volume, chs. 15 and 16.

24 Compare Raz's discussion in 'Human Rights in the Emerging World Order', this volume, ch. 11: at 221, he comes close to defining a right's ground as the value of what it protects.

grounds human rights, then we should accept that violation entails that something within this adequate range is not available for the right-holder, and that respect entails that an adequate range is available. This sounds rather attractive, even though it leaves Liao vulnerable to the problems outlined in section III.

Note that this is not to deny the further attractive thesis (for which Liao can readily make space) that while human rights are grounded on the importance of an adequate range of the fundamental conditions for a human *qua* human to pursue some basic activity, nonetheless human rights also gain support from other goods they deliver, such as the value of thinking of oneself and others as right-holders, and the value of an open society constituted by recognition of human rights.25

## **V. The Relation Between Human Rights' Empirical Results and their Grounding**

A difficult question for Liao—and for Griffin, Miller, Nussbaum, Renzo, and Tasioulas—arises from the fact that human rights are recognition-independent. Humans hold them even in societies in which no people, not even the holders themselves, recognize them. For this reason, a human right to X cannot be grounded *in a straightforwardly instrumental way* by the value of X. Nor can it gain support *straightforwardly instrumentally* from the value of one's thinking of oneself or others as holding a right to X, nor from the value of an open society constituted by recognition of human rights—as mentioned in the previous section. It cannot be grounded by its outcomes' value in a straightforwardly instrumental way because, as recognitionindependent, the right to X will survive even when none of these outcomes obtain because the right goes unrecognized.

My point here differs from the concern of the previous section. There (section IV), I rejected the thesis that human rights can be grounded as inessential supporters or promoters of their grounds. Now (section V) I outline a difficulty with grounding human rights even as *essential* and *guaranteeing* means for the obtaining of their grounds. The problem is how to make sense of the view that human rights, with their recognition-independent character, are grounded as *means* at all.

Trivial systems of rights are grounded in a simple instrumental way by the value of the outcomes they secure. To take an example used frequently, the important end of efficiency in movement is promoted by people's subjecting their driving and parking to regulations. The duties (not to drive the wrong way down a one-way street, to stop at red lights) and rights (that others will stop at stop signs; that others will not park for longer than they have paid for) are generated by this end in an instrumental way: the duties and rights exist because they help meet the important end of efficiency in movement. If they did not help to meet this end, perhaps because people's psychology changed so that they became totally unmotivated by government attempts

to regulate them, then there would be no point in having traffic regulations, and the duties and rights created by traffic regulations would cease to exist.

Unlike traffic regulations, *human rights* and *their* correlative duties would exist even in situations where they were useless or counter-productive as means for making their objects obtain. Suppose we lived in a terrible world in which a group was tortured and excluded. Suppose also that, perhaps due to certain religious beliefs, everyone accepted this as the norm and nobody ever came to think it violated human rights: nobody, not even members of the oppressed group, recognized their rights, and they will never come to recognize them. In such a situation, it looks as though the duties to refrain from torture and to allow political participation have no effects: the rights are useless in the same way that traffic regulations are useless in the example mentioned before. But I maintain that the members of the oppressed group in this case really do have human rights, even if the rights do nothing for the relevant people and never will.

From this I infer that Liao's and related approaches need a further component. Human rights might well be justified partly because, in Liao's words, they offer 'powerful protection', even indispensable protection, for something important like a minimally good life (and Liao might want to add that they also help secure an open society of value to us all, among other goods).26 But human rights' justification cannot proceed in the straightforward instrumental manner that works for trivial socially created rights like the traffic regulations. Rather, we need an explanation of how we get from the proposition that X is an important ground for rights (in Liao's terms, X is among a*n adequate range of the fundamental conditions for a human qua human to pursue some basic activity*) to a recognition-independent right to X, a right that exists even when X and its related values will never obtain.

Appealing to human rights' latent value—their value as rights which, *if respected*, would protect their holders in the manner specified by Liao—cannot provide the missing explanation. For the fact that certain traffic regulations would serve the good life if they were respected does not make such regulations exist under conditions in which they will never be respected: why, then, should a similar fact about human rights make them exist in my nightmare scenario above in which they will never be respected?

Some approaches to this question ground human rights entirely independently of the good life. For example, some take human rights as norms we cannot avoid presupposing if we are agents,27 as grounded on liberty and equality conceived independently of their role in the good life,28 or as grounded in dignity or our high worth taken independently of the good life.29 A particularly problematic conclusion for Liao (and related theorists) would be if such approaches succeeded in grounding

human rights, and further if a person's living a minimally good life was then defined in part by whether their rights were respected. On such an approach, the minimally good life would ultimately depend on human rights rather than vice versa. This would enable us to explain away the appeal of Liao's position. One could say that there is indeed, as noted in section I, a close relation between a person's human rights and their living a good life: but not because—as Liao claims—human rights are grounded on the good life; rather, there is a partial grounding relationship in the other direction.

If the requisite independent grounds can be found for human rights, then it seems to me fairly likely that the good life will then be defined in part by respect for such rights. Violations of my right to X are an affront to me *qua* violations even when my life would otherwise go successfully without X: consider violations of unneeded but justly acquired property. Such an affront is an effect on the quality of my life in some sense, independently of whether I would ever have used the property in question.

Nonetheless, there are two reasons for Liao to be untroubled by this. First, it is doubtful that violations of a person's human rights will *qua* violations necessarily condemn their victim to a life that is *less than minimally* good. Such a move would entail the liberal imperialist position rejected earlier: the position which classifies most people throughout history as unable to attain a minimally good life. It is more attractive to say merely that violations of human rights must *qua* violations have *some* effect on whether the victim's life is as good as it could be. To avoid the liberal imperialist view we should insulate whether one has a 'minimally good life' from moral affronts caused by human rights violations *qua* violations (or indeed, human rights deficits *qua* deficits)—though the quality of one's life above this minimal level cannot be so insulated.

Secondly, there are major difficulties for each of the good-life-independent approaches to human rights mentioned, though I lack space to go into this here. A seeming 'middle way' is offered by Kamm and Nagel, who claim that there is something good about the existence of human rights independently of whether they are respected or recognized:

[T]here may be a type of good that already exists but that would not exist if it were permissible to transgress the right of one person in order to save many lives. This is the good of being someone whose worth is such that it makes him highly inviolable and also makes him someone to whom one owes nonviolation. This good does imply that certain of one's interests should not be sacrificed, but inviolability matters not merely because it instrumentally serves those interests. . . .Inviolability is a reflection of the worth of the person. On this account, it is impermissible for me to harm the person in order to save many in the accident, because doing so is inconsistent with his having this status.30

Aspects of this passage—the 'good of being someone . . . '—suggest that bare possession of human rights independently of whether they are recognized is not only

<sup>30</sup> Kamm, *Intricate Ethics*, 253–4.

good as such, but good for the right-holder, and I can see the appeal of this position. Possession of human rights makes the miserable situation of those whose rights are forever unrecognized qualify as a *violation*, one in which *they have been wronged*, and *wronged in the way humans can be wronged*. Possession of human rights generates these normative consequences even if nobody recognizes them. It can seem as though it would be even worse if the relevant people were suffering as outlined in my earlier example but this suffering did not count as wronging them: that would be for them to have the status of insects or robots, beings that (I here just assert) cannot be wronged. And it would also be worse for them if their suffering qualified only as wronging them in the way that animals can be wronged.31

But these claims are odd. If human rights are necessarily borne by humans, then it seems that by saying their bare existence makes one's life go 'better' one is asserting that it is good for one that the impossible does not obtain—and this is problematic. Even the claim that human rights are merely 'a good' rather than 'good *for* their holders' is odd, because it appears to be the claim that the world is somehow better for the fact that humans hold human rights—but again this looks like asserting that it is good that the impossible (humans lacking human rights) does not obtain.32

Perhaps Kamm and Nagel need not be given this reading: in the quotation provided earlier, Kamm is cautious, saying only that 'there *may be* a type of good. . . ' (emphasis added). If we reject this good-based approach, we can still retain Kamm's notion of human rights as reflections or expressions of humans' high worth. This idea can be taken simply to offer an independent account of human rights' grounds, one that should not be understood in terms of the 'good'. But even so taken, Kamm's and Nagel's account has notable limitations when considered on its own: to say simply that human rights are grounded independently of their effects because as bare normative structures they reflect or express humans' high worth is to leave human rights' contents under-determined. Kamm tries to argue that certain specific rights (in particular, constraints on interference with an intricate form of priority over requirements of assistance) constitute an inviolability that is a necessary reflection of humans' high worth.33 But rights with alternative contents and stringency (for example, rights prioritizing assistance over non-interference) would give us different forms of high worth; if human rights are grounded solely as reflections of our high worth, this leaves it under-determined which particular rights we hold.34

In my view, the best reading of the Kamm/Nagel position, and also positions appealing to dignity, is as attempts to provide the supplement needed by approaches like

34 Kasper Lippert-Rasmussen considers a possible world of 'high unignorability' but 'low inviolability' in which agents are required to harm some in order to prevent more occurrences of similar harms to others; in one respect, this world confers a higher status on people (by making them especially unignorable) than a world of 'high inviolability' of the type Kamm considers (Lippert-Rasmussen, 'Moral Status and the Impermissibility of Minimizing Violations', *Philosophy and Public Affairs*, 25 (1996): 333–51, 340–1). Lippert-Rasmussen goes on to consider other alternative high status structures (eg, 'high unsacrificeability', 349–50), as does Shelly Kagan in his 'Replies to My Critics', *Philosophy and Phenomenological Research*, 51 (1991): 919–28, 920. See also Rowan Cruft, 'Kamm and Miller on Rights' Compatibility', *Ethical Theory and Moral Practice*, 13 (2010): 393–401.

<sup>31</sup> Nagel, 'Personal Rights and Public Space', 37–9.

Liao's: the explanation for why exactly the fact that X is of great importance grounds *recognition-independent* rights to X, rights that persist even when there is no chance of attaining X. For Liao, X refers to an adequate range of the fundamental conditions for a human *qua* human to pursue the basic activities, but the same question arises for Tasioulas (for whom X refers to the basic interests of beings with dignity) or Griffin (for whom X is humans' personhood construed in terms of agency) or Nussbaum (for whom X is the 'Central Capabilities').35 When X is efficiency in traffic movement, the rights grounded are not recognition-independent. Similarly, I would say that whatever X grounds property rights fails to make them recognition-independent. Perhaps what the Kamm/Nagel and dignity positions highlight is that the X in the case of human rights has a special character such that we should be required to pursue it even when we will not, and indeed even when there is no hope that we will.

But this is just a schematic description of how the Kamm/Nagel or dignity positions could fill the relevant gap. For Liao's view or its cognates to give us a full account of what grounds human rights and of what this tells us about such rights' contents, more must be said. In Liao's terms, the relevant questions will be: why exactly do rights grounded in the importance of an adequate range of the conditions for humans qua humans to pursue the basic activities *reflect or express their holders' high worth or dignity as humans*, in a way that rights with alternative groundings do not? And why does such reflection or expression mean that the relevant rights exist independently of whether they are recognized?36

To my mind, the second question is harder. To begin to answer the first, we can note that any right grounded primarily just in what it does for its individual holder *qua* human will reflect or express her intrinsic worth or value as a human: this includes any rights grounded in the manner Liao, Griffin, Nussbaum or Tasioulas specify for human rights. By contrast, a right grounded primarily by what it does for others beyond the right-holder will not express the holder's intrinsic worth: consider a parent's right to child benefit payments, or a pregnant woman's right not to be executed.37 And a right grounded by what it does for the right-holder *qua* contextually situated individual will not express the right-holder's intrinsic worth *as a human*: consider my right, as a British citizen living in Scotland, to free dental check-ups under the National Health Service.

Yet even if these thoughts can establish that rights grounded in Liao's way will—unlike many other rights—reflect or express their holders' intrinsic high worth as humans, we need to say much more if we are to understand why rights that express this high worth are *recognition-independent*, while rights which do not are not.

<sup>36</sup> Renzo considers similar issues in his chapter. We can rephrase these questions in Renzo's terms: why exactly do actions violating rights grounded on basic needs 'represent the value of the victim as less than the value that she possesses', in a way that rights with alternative groundings do not (Renzo, 'Human Needs, Human Rights', 582)? And why are rights whose violation involves such misrepresentation recognition-independent?

<sup>37</sup> The examples are drawn from Raz, 'Rights and Individual Well-Being', 50. For defence of the thesis that any right which qualifies as a human right must be grounded primarily by what it does for the individual right-holder, see Rowan Cruft, 'Why is it Disrespectful to Violate Rights?', *Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society*, 63 (2013): 201–24, 208.

### **VI. Conclusion**

An approach like Liao's is attractive for anyone who sees human rights as secularized natural or basic rights.38 I said that my aim was to sketch the key challenges for such approaches to overcome. The three toughest challenges considered are as follows, I think.

First, how exactly can we identify the forms of good life that our human nature makes possible? For Griffin, Miller, Nussbaum, Renzo or Tasioulas, the parallel question is: how can we identify the aspects of agency that define the threshold concept of a 'normative agent', or how can we identify the basic needs, the central capabilities or the basic interests?

Secondly, to avoid making respect for human rights necessary for the right-holder's living a minimally good life, Liao must ground human rights on the importance of the availability of a range of ways of living a good life—a range wider than that range *necessary* for a minimally good life. How can we justify appealing to this range, and in a way that makes it neither too wide nor too narrow? Or for Griffin, Miller, Nussbaum, Renzo or Tasioulas: why does securing a wide range of agency interests, basic needs, capabilities or basic interests matter even when the right-holder is able to live a good life without the full range being secured for her? And what exactly determines the parameters of the appropriate range?

Thirdly, why does the particular X that human rights protect ground recognitionindependent rights, rights that persist even when there is no hope of securing X for their holders?

Filling in these gaps would give us a satisfyingly complete theory of human rights as basic or natural pre-legal rights.39

38 And it also seems necessary as at least part of a 'political' account. See n. 3, and Liao, 'Human Rights as Fundamental Conditions for a Good Life', section VI.
