### *Elizabeth Ashford*

There is a long-standing debate over whether or not it is possible to enjoy traditional negative human rights against harmful or coercive treatment without enjoying some minimal degree of economic security. 1 At issue is the plausibility of the view that the only genuine human rights are negative rights against interference by other agents, such as the right not to be tortured. (For ease of exposition I will refer to this as "the libertarian position" since it is at the core of libertarianism, although it is of course shared by many who do not accept other aspects of libertarianism. Indeed, as I discuss in the last section, the standard response to violations of certain rights against harmful treatment to which the destitute are vulnerable has much in common with the libertarian position.) A central critique of this view is that negative rights cannot be adequately enjoyed by those who do not enjoy the right to subsistence.

There are two ways in which this critique may be formulated. The first is that those who do not enjoy the right to subsistence cannot adequately enjoy their negative rights in the sense that they cannot derive maximum advantage from those rights. On this argument, lack of economic means affects the value to the right-holder of their liberty rights. It does not, though, undermine the liberty rights themselves.

Thus Isaiah Berlin, for example, while emphasizing that liberty rights may not be very valuable to those who lack adequate subsistence, argues that lack of means affects the worth of liberty, not liberty itself.2 Similarly, Rawls draws a distinction between a liberty itself and the worth of that liberty, and argues that lack of means is not to be counted among the constraints definitive of liberty. He takes a liberty to be a socially protected option, and the worth of that liberty to be the value a person can derive from the exercise of the option.3

This first argument has the important implication that if we take seriously the values that make the possession of liberty rights important to the right-holder we ought to take seriously the right to subsistence. Nevertheless, it is still open to the libertarian to respond that there is no obligation to ensure that right-holders derive the full

advantage from their rights. Accordingly, she can argue that it is perfectly coherent to affirm the existence of negative human rights without affirming the existence of a human right to subsistence.

There is, however, a second, stronger version of the critique. This is the claim that those who do not enjoy the right to subsistence cannot be held to adequately enjoy negative human rights in the sense that the duties imposed by those other rights cannot be held to have been adequately fulfilled. I should emphasize that the claim is not that actually enjoying the object of the right to subsistence is a physical precondition for enjoying the *object* of other negative human rights; the claim, rather, is that fulfilling the duties imposed by the right to subsistence is a precondition for adequately fulfilling the *duties* imposed by negative human rights. The claim therefore does not have the implausible implication that a right cannot be enjoyed unless the preconditions for actually enjoying the object of that right are enjoyed.4

If enjoyment of the right to subsistence is essential to enjoyment of negative human rights in this second sense of the term "enjoyment", then in affirming a negative human right we are thereby committed to affirming the right to subsistence. Core human rights are claim rights, which conceptually entail the existence of corresponding duties. Therefore, acknowledging a claim right entails acknowledging its corresponding duties. If fulfilling the duties imposed by negative human rights requires realizing right-holders' right to subsistence, then acknowledging the negative right entails acknowledging a human right to subsistence.

An especially famous and influential version of this argument has been put forward by Henry Shue.5 He contends that moral rights are, by definition, claims that actual enjoyment of the substance of the right be socially protected against standard threats. They therefore impose a corresponding duty to implement social guarantees against such threats. Shue then claims that not enjoying the right to subsistence is itself a standard threat to the enjoyment of the substance of any other right. His principal argument for this claim is that the destitute are highly vulnerable to being coerced into forgoing their other rights.

Shue concludes that enjoying the right to subsistence is "necessary for enjoying any other right", where the term "necessary" is to be interpreted "in the restricted sense of 'made essential by the very concept of a right' ".6 Accordingly, it is logically inconsistent to acknowledge any right without also acknowledging a right to subsistence. It is also practically inconsistent, given that enjoying the right to subsistence is indispensible to the enjoyment of every other right.

4 A precondition for actually enjoying the object of a liberty right to take a certain journey is that the route not be blocked by freak weather conditions, but clearly such weather conditions do not undermine enjoyment of the right. Thomas Pogge takes Henry Shue's argument for a basic human right to subsistence, on one interpretation of it, to be based on such an assumption. (I have defended Henry Shue's argument against this and some other aspects of Pogge's critique in "In What Sense is the Right to Subsistence a Basic Right?", *Journal of Social Philosophy*, 40(4) (December 2009), special issue on "Human Rights: Normative Requirements and Institutional Constraints", eds. Andreas Follesdal, Thomas Pogge, and Carol Gould.)

In recent years, however, it has been widely argued (even among advocates of the claim that there is a human right to subsistence) that Shue's claim that enjoyment of the right to subsistence is necessary to the enjoyment of every other human right is too strong.7 One objection that has been raised to Shue's argument is that he fails to establish that inadequate enjoyment of the right to subsistence is a severe threat to the enjoyment of other human rights.8 A second objection is that he fails to establish that it is a standard threat.9 Third, it has been argued that the threat can in any case be addressed without securing the right to subsistence, simply by banning the coercive contracts to which the destitute are vulnerable.10

But a further objection to Shue's argument concerns the concept of moral rights on which it is based. It has been objected that his argument relies on a contentious definition of rights that a libertarian will simply reject. Therefore, it is argued, Shue begs the question by building into his definition of moral rights substantive assumptions that cannot be settled by conceptual fiat, and that underlie his conclusion that the right to subsistence is a basic right.11

Shue is assuming that acknowledging a right entails acknowledging a duty to ensure that right-holders are protected against standard threats to their enjoyment of the substance of the right. However, the libertarian can deny this. The libertarian will argue that the right not to be tortured, for example, can be fully respected by agents' merely refraining from torturing anyone else. It should be emphasized that libertarians do also acknowledge a (secondary) duty to enforce a ban on acts of torture.12 However, they do not acknowledge a duty of justice to protect right-holders against all standard threats to freedom from torture. Therefore even if the libertarian accepts that not enjoying the right to subsistence is a standard threat to the enjoyment of negative human rights, it does not follow that in affirming the negative human rights she is thereby committed to affirming a human right to subsistence.

For an incisive analysis of this aspect of Shue's argument, see Beitz and Goodin, *Global Basic Rights*, Introduction, 7–8.

12 The claim that the right not to be tortured can be adequately respected by refraining from torturing draws a distinction between the primary and secondary duties imposed by a right, where the primary duties are the correlative duties, violation of which constitutes the violation of the right. Shue argues against the claim that rights can be divided into positive and negative rights, on the ground that both kinds of rights impose both positive and negative duties (Shue, *Basic Rights*, ch. 2). The libertarian, however, can reply that negative rights are those that impose only negative duties as their *primary* duties. Thus, the right against torture imposes only a negative primary duty not to torture, and a secondary (positive) duty to enforce a ban on torture.

In short, this worry with Shue's argument is that it collapses into the first line of argument. The absence of social guarantees against standard threats to enjoyment of the substance of negative rights means that such rights will be less effective. They will therefore be of less worth to the right-holder. Once more, though, the libertarian can deny that we have any positive duty to ensure that others' negative rights are effective (beyond enforcing a ban on violations of the rights).

On behalf of Shue, it should be emphasized that the threat to the enjoyment of other rights on which his argument primarily focuses is that of vulnerability to coercion. While libertarians do not acknowledge a positive duty to protect right-holders against all standard threats to their enjoyment of human rights, they do acknowledge a positive duty to protect right-holders against being coerced into forgoing such rights; they accept that if right-holders are coerced into forgoing the object of a right, this undermines their enjoyment of the right, and they acknowledge a duty to enforce a ban on such coercion.

Nevertheless, the problem reemerges with the account of coercion on which Shue's argument is based. Libertarians conceive of coercion as a form of wrongful interference, involving reducing the victims' range of options by threatening to harm them if they fail to comply with the coercer's demand. Shue's first example of the kind of coercion to which the destitute are vulnerable uncontroversially constitutes extreme coercion. He points out that the threat of destroying persons' means of subsistence is just as effective as the threat of assault in coercing people into not exercising, say, their right to peaceful assembly. However, this justifies only some aspects of the human right to subsistence, as it is generally understood and as Shue understands it. It justifies a claim against being actively deprived of one's means of obtaining a subsistence income. It does not, though, justify a claim to assistance if one is unable to obtain for oneself a subsistence income and if the obstacles to one's doing so have not been wrongfully created by other agents. Establishing a human right to subsistence that incorporates this second claim requires showing that destitution in itself undermines adequate enjoyment of other rights.

Shue's argument therefore relies on his claim that those who are already destitute are also vulnerable to being coerced into forgoing their negative human rights in exchange for subsistence.13 I will call contracts of this second kind "subsistence exchange contracts" (and will shortly argue that they are in fact far from exotic). However, given that subsistence exchange contracts do not involve the threat of harm, but rather increase right-holders' range of options, libertarians are liable to deny that they constitute coercion. Moreover, while neither Shue nor his critics have distinguished his two examples of coercion, what I will call the torture contract example—a subsistence exchange contract in my sense—has been the target of most of the criticism of his argument.14

<sup>13</sup> Shue, *Basic Rights*, 184–7. Thus, although his discussion of this comes only in a footnote, it is crucial to his argument.

<sup>14</sup> Thus, Nickel and Hasse argue that the torture contract is not a severe threat to enjoyment of the right against torture; Nickel and Pogge argue that it is not a standard threat to the enjoyment of the right against torture; and Andrew I. Cohn argues that the right against torture could be secured against the threat to it posed by the torture contracts by banning the torture contracts (for references see nn. 7 and 8).

I offer here a development of Shue's argument. I will argue that an analysis of the *difference* between subsistence exchange contracts and standard coercion implies that the failure to acknowledge a human right to subsistence is inconsistent with the substantive values that underlie acknowledgement of uncontroversial negative human rights, on any plausible account of such values. My argument, then, unlike the second line of argument against the libertarian, appeals directly to the substantive values that underlie acknowledgement of negative human rights, rather than to the very concept of such rights. However, my argument goes beyond the first line of argument in response to the libertarian, that taking seriously such values implies that we ought to take seriously the right to subsistence. I aim to show that failing to acknowledge a human right to subsistence is *inconsistent* with the values that underlie the acknowledgement of negative human rights.

In section I, I analyse the nature of subsistence exchange contracts and the way in which they differ from standard coercion. I argue that regardless of whether or not subsistence exchange contracts are classified as coercion, the threat they pose to the enjoyment of negative rights is just as severe as that posed by extreme standard coercion. This enables an argument to be made for the moral significance of subsistence exchange contracts that avoids the contentious assumption that they constitute coercion.

In section II, I further analyse what underlies the threat that subsistence exchange contracts pose to the enjoyment of other human rights. On the basis of this analysis I then argue, in section III, that this threat is common, and in fact liable to be pervasive. Indeed, an increasingly prevalent form of widely recognized violations of negative rights against harmful treatment actually consist in subsistence exchange contracts. (Examples include child labor, sweat-shop labor, and human smuggling.) It is widely accepted (including by libertarians) that acknowledgement of rights against such harmful treatment entails acknowledging both a primary duty not to inflict it and a secondary duty to enforce a ban on it. Accordingly, the standard response to child labor and so on is to enforce an immediate ban. However, as I argue in section IV, another implication of the way in which subsistence exchange contracts differ from standard coercion is that enforcement of a ban on them without securing right-holders' right to subsistence is systemically severely detrimental to right-holders' overall interests and range of options. Thus, enforcing a ban on these violations of uncontroversial negative human rights, without securing the right-holders' right to subsistence, is not just of little value to the right-holder, it is actually severely disvaluable to the right-holder. This is inconsistent with taking the acknowledgement of the right to be for the sake of the right-holder. In section V I further analyse the nature of this moral inconsistency.

#### **I. The Nature of Subsistence Exchange Contracts**

Subsistence exchange contracts, in which a destitute individual agrees to severely harmful treatment in exchange for subsistence, have one important similarity with standard coercion, which I now discuss, and two important differences (which I discuss in sections II and III, respectively). As I now argue, the threat they pose to the enjoyment of other rights is just as severe as that posed by standard coercion. I begin with an analysis of Shue's torture contract example.

#### **A.╇ The torture contract**

Shue's argument that subsistence exchange contracts constitute coercion is based on the claim that the choice of accepting the contract is just as non-voluntary as in cases of severe standard coercion. Shue points out that a common form of coercion in prisons involves the guards' threatening to withhold food from the prisoners unless the prisoners agree to the guards' demands. This is an uncontroversial example of extreme coercion, given that the guards are responsible for deliberately and wrongfully introducing the prisoners' restricted choice situation. It is equally uncontroversial that the prisoners' choice of complying with the guards' demand in order to avoid the threat of inadequate food is non-voluntary. Shue argues that in just the same way, destitute individuals are vulnerable to being coerced into forgoing another right in exchange for subsistence. Shue's example of this kind of coercion is a torture contract a destitute individual enters into with a sadistic millionaire, in which he forgoes his right against torture in exchange for subsistence.15 Shue contends that since the destitute individual agrees to the contract only because the alternative is not eating adequately, his choice is just as non-voluntary as the prisoners' choice to comply with the guards' demands. Shue infers that the contract should be classified as coercion, rather than as a contract in which the destitute individual is voluntarily waiving his right against torture:

If one's only hope of eating adequately is to submit to torture, one is being coerced into submitting to torture, not renouncing one's right not to be tortured.16

Shue is here appealing to a widely assumed moralized conception of non-voluntary choice, according to which non-voluntary choice is intrinsically morally problematic, and its morally problematic nature is to be equated with its being is coerced.17 Shue's reasoning is that since the destitute individual's choice is driven by the fact that the only alternative is inadequate subsistence, which is not a sustainable option, it should be classified as non-voluntary in just the same way as the prisoners' choice to comply with the prison guards' demands. He concludes from this that it ought to be classified as coercion. Along similar lines, O'Neill argues that the hallmark of a coercive proposal is that it is one the victim "cannot refuse", so that agreeing to it is not a genuine "expression of agency".18

<sup>15</sup> Shue, *Basic Rights*, 184–7. 16 Shue, *Basic Rights*, 186.

<sup>17</sup> Alan Wertheimer, in his classic book on coercion, defends such a moralized conception of voluntary choice; *Coercion* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1987), 201. He contends that "there are no structural features of an individual's 'choice conditions' that are of much moral interest"; rather, the moral significance of a restricted choice situation depends on whether it wrongfully arose. He then offers an analysis of non-voluntary choice in terms of choice that is coerced. I take him to be assuming that non-voluntary choice is an intrinsically morally significant concept. If the structural features of an agent's restricted choice situation are of no moral significance then an analysis of non-voluntary choice, if it is to capture its moral significance, cannot be based only on those structural features themselves. Non-voluntary choice therefore has to be analysed as choice made in a restricted choice situation that has been wrongfully introduced by the coercer.

Again, coercion is conceived in terms of whether or not the choice to accept the proposal is voluntary (which O'Neill understands in terms of whether or not the choice is a genuine "expression of agency").

However, advocates of the position Shue opposes, that draws a sharp distinction between positive and negative duties and rights,19 are liable to deny that subsistence exchange contracts constitute coercion precisely because the proposer is not wrongfully introducing the recipient's restricted choice situation. The proposer is, rather, increasing the recipient's range of options. Given the assumption that a non-voluntary choice is one that is coerced, then if, as the libertarian claims, the torture contract is not coercive, it follows that the destitute individual's choice of accepting it is voluntary.

The libertarian will therefore describe the contract as one in which the destitute individual *exercises* his right against torture by voluntarily choosing to waive it in exchange for subsistence, rather than as one in which he is forced to forgo it. On this view, then, the torture contract should not be described as a threat to the destitute individual's right against torture, but as an exercise of that right.

The difference between the torture contract and standard coercion is presumably what underlies James Nickel and Lizbeth Hasse's objection that the torture contract is not in fact a *severe* threat to the enjoyment of the right against torture:

Even if a person chooses to waive his right not to be tortured by accepting torture in exchange for food, the person could still be said to have in some sense enjoyed the right not to be tortured. By choosing to waive his right not to be tortured, the person was able to receive something of value, namely food, in exchange.20

Their reasoning here seems to be that since the contract differs from standard coercion in that the destitute individual agrees to it because he gets something out of it, it should be characterized as one in which he exercises and thereby (at least "in some sense") enjoys his right against torture.

Thus, if non-voluntary choice is equated with choice that is coerced, then whether or not the choice to accept the contract is voluntary depends on what account of coercion is accepted. Shue argues that the choice is non-voluntary and that the contract therefore constitutes coercion. The libertarian, conversely, will argue that the contract does not constitute coercion, because the agent's restricted choice situation has not been wrongfully introduced by the coercer. The libertarian will conclude that the choice to agree to the contract is voluntary.

If the choice to agree to the torture contract is not voluntary, the contract is a threat to the enjoyment of the right against torture, since the destitute individual is forced to forgo her right against torture. If, on the other hand, the choice is voluntary, it constitutes the destitute individual's exercising her right against torture by voluntarily choosing to waive it.

Thus, Shue's appeal to the claim that the torture contract (to which destitute individuals are vulnerable) constitutes coercion, in defence of the claim that destitution

poses a severe threat to the enjoyment of negative human rights, relies on an account of coercion that many, libertarians among them, will dispute. It is therefore in tension with his general strategy of showing that the right to subsistence constitutes a basic right by appeal to uncontentious premises that the libertarian accepts, in order to show that in affirming only negative rights the libertarian is thereby committed to affirming a human right to subsistence.

I will now offer a non-moralized analysis of the nature of non-voluntary choice, which separates the nature of the threat to voluntary choice itself from the question of whether the agent's choice should be classified as one that is coerced.21 I shall analyse non-voluntary choice in terms of the way in which the structural features of the agent's restricted choice situation affect the agent's will. These structural features themselves are independent of the way in which the restricted choice situation arose. They can therefore be assessed independently of the question of whether or not the agent's choice situation was wrongfully introduced by a coercer.22

I aim to show, on the one hand, that Shue is right to claim that the destitute individual's choice to accept the torture contract is non-voluntary. The contract should indeed be described as constituting a severe threat to the enjoyment of the right against torture, rather than as an instance of the right-holder's voluntarily choosing to waive her right against torture.

On the other hand, I also contend that classifying the torture contract as coercion is unhelpful and liable to be misleading. It is unhelpful, insofar as it begs the question against the libertarian. An advantage of the non-moralized analysis of the nature of voluntary choice is that it can ground the argument that subsistence exchange contracts pose a severe threat to the enjoyment of negative human rights, while avoiding the contentious assumption, which the libertarian will reject, that the contracts constitute coercion.

The reason that classifying subsistence exchange contracts as "coercion" is liable to be misleading is because it may lead us to put the moral focus on the wrongfulness of the behavior of the people offering the subsistence exchange contracts, by labeling them as coercers. Insofar as the label is appropriate it is because, in common with standard coercers, agents offering subsistence exchange contracts may be subjugating the victim to their own will. The torture contract is a salient example of this. The torture contract overrides the destitute individual's enormously strong aversion to torture, and could not have been reasonably agreed to unless the option of refusing were completely unsustainable. Moreover, sadistic desire is premised on the awareness of such aversion. The torture contract is therefore an extreme case of a person's being

21 Along similar lines, Serena Olsaretti offers a non-moralized account of voluntary choice; *Liberty, Desert and the Market* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004), 140.

22 I should emphasize that a non-moralized analysis of the nature of non-voluntary choice is compatible with acknowledging that the *term* "non-voluntary" is generally used in a moralized sense. Moreover, in cases of minor coercion, the moral significance of the agent's mildly restricted choice situation is likely to be entirely exhausted by the fact that the victim's restricted choice situation has been wrongfully introduced by the coercer. In such cases, we would normally describe the choice as non-voluntary only because it has been coerced; we would not normally apply the term "non-voluntary" to a choice made in a structurally identical choice situation in which the restriction to the agent's options had not been wrongfully introduced by the coercer.

used as a mere means to another's ends. It is worth emphasizing, then, that although the torture contract does not conform to the libertarian account of coercion, it instantiates the feature that Hayek and other libertarians identify as what is particularly morally troubling about coercion: that it "eliminates an individual as a thinking and valuing person and makes him a bare tool in the achievement of the ends of another".23

Nonetheless, in all cases of subsistence exchange contracts, focusing on the wrongfulness of the proposer's behavior is too narrow, because the core threat to the right-holder's range of options is independent of the proposer. As I argue in section III, it is for this reason that the threat that subsistence exchange contracts pose to the enjoyment of other rights is so common and pervasive. And, as I argue in section IV, it is for this reason that addressing subsistence exchange contracts by simply enforcing a ban on them—which is the appropriate response for cases of standard coercion—is deeply problematic from the point of view of the right-holder.

For these reasons, I contend, a non-moralized account of non-voluntary choice, that does not identify such choice with choice that is coerced, enables a clearer analysis of the moral implications of the threat that subsistence exchange contracts pose to other human rights. I now turn to such an account.

#### **B.╇ A non-moralized analysis of non-voluntary choice**

In order to develop an account of non-voluntary choice that does not appeal to contentious intuitions about what constitutes coercion, I will examine cases that are uncontroversial examples of standard coercion. It is generally accepted that coerced choices are non-voluntary. I will identify the key features of non-voluntary choice in cases of classic coercion, and will then argue that these features are shared by subsistence exchange contracts.

#### *i.╇ What makes coerced choices non-voluntary?*

In cases of standard coercion, the coercer threatens to harm the victim unless the victim complies with the coercer's demand. The coercer thereby renders ineligible every option other than that of complying with the demand, on the ground that all these other options involve suffering the threatened harm. By "ineligible" options, I mean ones that are not choice-worthy. Thus the way coercion operates is to ensure that the victim has no eligible choice but to accept the proposal.

It is widely acknowledged that some forms of coercion are more severe than others, and the obvious explanation for this is the severity of the threatened harm, on an objective conception of well-being. In cases of minor coercion, a fairly trivial threat of harm renders the option of refusing the proposal an ineligible choice *in comparison with* the other available options. For example, the threat of vandalizing one of a millionaire's many luxury yachts unless she agrees to pay out a small fraction of her wealth as "protection money" could be sufficient to bring it about that she judges the option of refusing the demand to be an ineligible choice relative to the alternative

<sup>23</sup> *The Constitution of Liberty* (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul, 1960), 21.

available options.24 Clearly, the threatened harm could not be plausibly held to be one that would, in Herman's phrase, "gravely diminish her life."25

By contrast, in cases of extreme coercion, the cost of refusing the coercer's demand is so severe that the option of refusing the demand is ineligible not just in the sense of being non-choiceworthy *relative* to the available alternatives, but in the sense of being intrinsically unacceptable, on an objective conception of well-being. In the most extreme cases of coercion, the threatened harm is so severe as to be unsustainable—not in the sense that it is beyond human capacity to endure, but in the sense that anyone would have a desperate and ever-pressing desire to avoid it. (Even here, then, *pace* O'Neill, it is not the case that the coercer's demand is an option the victim literally "cannot refuse." As O'Neill herself points out, some people do.)26

Examples of extreme coercion include the threat to murder or torture the victim, or the victim's family members. The murder of the victim's child would significantly undermine their well-being so as to mar their life, in large part because it would undermine one of their most central ends, of raising a flourishing child and protecting their child from harm. Shue's example of prison guards' threatening prisoners with inadequate food is another example of extreme coercion, given that not eating adequately is an unsustainable option. This kind of severe coercion is, as Shue points out, a common and very effective way of pressuring right-holders into refraining from exercising a certain right.

It should be emphasized that the sense in which coerced choices are non-voluntary is perfectly compatible with their being based on a reasoned assessment of the value of the alternatives. Indeed, even in cases of extreme coercion in which the coercer threatens to kill the victim's child unless the victim complies with the coercer's demand, the victim's choice of complying is an expression of one of his most fundamental values, as a parent. In one important sense, then, coerced choices are a deeply important "expression of agency", also *pace* O'Neill (I return to the significance of this in the final section).

Rather, the sense in which a coerced choice is non-voluntary is that it is made only because of the ineligibility of the alternative options. In cases of extreme coercion, the threatened harm is so severe that the option of refusing is unacceptable on an objective conception of well-being, to the point of being unsustainable. In such cases, the choice to comply with the demand is non-voluntary in the sense that it is made only because the alternative is unsustainable.

24 This is an example in which the moral significance of the mild threat to voluntary choice posed by the agent's somewhat restricted choice situation is entirely exhausted by its having been wrongfully introduced by the coercer. Given that, as I mentioned earlier (see n. 22), the term "non-voluntary" is generally used in a moralized sense, as referring only to contexts in which the threat to voluntary choice is morally significant, we would describe her choice to pay the "protection" money as non-voluntary only because her restricted choice situation has been wrongfully introduced by the coercer. If she were to choose to pay the same sum of money to prevent naturally occurring damage to the yacht, we would not normally describe this choice as non-voluntary.

#### *ii.╇ Why subsistence exchange contracts are equally non-voluntary*

If, as I have argued, what makes the prisoners' acceptance of the guards' demands nonvoluntary is that the option of refusing is unsustainable, then the destitute individual's acceptance of the torture contract is just as non-voluntary. In just the same way as the coerced prisoner, the destitute individual agrees to the subsistence exchange contract only because the only available alternative is inadequate subsistence, which is unsustainable.

The core difference between the two cases is that in the first case, the threat to the victim's basic interests posed by inadequate subsistence is wrongfully introduced by the coercer in order to ensure the victim's compliance. In the second case, the threat to the victim's basic interests posed by inadequate subsistence is already in place, prior to the contract. In both cases, however, the choice to agree to the contract is made only because the cost of refusing the contract is inadequate subsistence, which is unsustainable. It makes no difference to the nature of the choice itself whether or not the person offering him the proposal is responsible for having wrongfully introduced the victim's severely restricted choice situation.

Thus, on this analysis, voluntariness or non-voluntariness is a property of the choice itself. The nature of the choice depends on how the structural features of the agent's choice situation affect the agent's will, and this is unaffected by how that choice situation arose. In the case of the coerced prisoner and the destitute individual agreeing to the torture contract, the restricted choice situation is identical, and affects the agent's will in the same way: in both cases the agents make the choice they do only because the alternative is inadequate subsistence, which is unsustainable. Thus, both choices are non-voluntary in the same respect: they are made only because the option of refusing is unsustainable. (I should emphasize once more that choices that are non-voluntary in this sense may be deeply important expressions of agency.)

I contend, then, that Shue is right that the destitute individual's agreeing to the torture contract is non-voluntary, in just the same way as extreme standard coercion; the threat to the right-holder's voluntary choice itself is the same in both cases. The destitute individual can no more plausibly be held to be voluntarily waiving his right against torture in exchange for food than is the prisoner voluntarily waiving other rights in exchange for subsistence. Rather, the torture contract should be classified as a case in which the destitute individual non-voluntarily forgoes his right against torture, in just the same way as the coerced prisoner. I conclude that subsistence exchange contracts pose a threat to the enjoyment of other rights that is just as severe as the threat posed by extreme standard coercion.

This brings us to the question of whether the threat is also a standard one. A central aspect of Shue's argument is that inadequate enjoyment of the right to subsistence poses a standard threat to the enjoyment of other rights. On Shue's account of rights, to recall, rights impose a duty to implement social guarantees against standard threats to their enjoyment of other rights. If not enjoying the right to subsistence is a standard threat to enjoying negative human rights, then those negative human rights impose a duty to fulfill the right to subsistence.

However, a second core objection to Shue's argument is that the torture contract, far from being a standard threat to the right against torture, is an "exotic threat."27 Thomas Pogge argues moreover that contracts in which a destitute individual forgoes another human right in exchange for subsistence might be unavailable, in which case the link that Shue draws between destitution and inadequate enjoyment of other human rights is altogether severed.

I now give a fuller analysis of the nature of the threat to enjoyment of other rights posed by inadequate subsistence, and of the way in which this threat differs from that posed by standard coercion. I then argue that in virtue of this difference, the threat subsistence contracts pose to the enjoyment of other rights is liable to be more pervasive than that posed by standard coercion.

## **II. The Nature of the Threat that Subsistence Exchange Contracts Pose to the Enjoyment of Human Rights**

The core threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other rights is grounded in the severity of the threat to persons' basic interests and most important ends posed by inadequate subsistence. The severity of this threat has two central implications. First, inadequate subsistence is unsustainable. Second, it is liable to be even worse than the option of forgoing any other right. It follows that whenever forgoing another right is the only available opportunity for obtaining adequate subsistence, the right-holder is liable to be driven to forgo that right, because continuing inadequate subsistence is liable to be the most unsustainable option of all.

Human rights against harmful and coercive treatment are identified as such (at least in large part) because of the severity of the harm they inflict on persons' basic interests and the threat they pose to agents' pursuit of their own ends. However, the threat to persons' basic interests and core ends posed by inadequate subsistence is so severe that it is liable to outweigh even the harm posed by forgoing negative human rights.

The torture contract case vividly illustrates this. The right against torture is one of the most urgent negative human rights, given the severity of the harm it causes, relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline of harm, and the undermining it is liable to cause of victims' capacity to adhere to their core commitments and ends.28 The option of agreeing to torture is itself unsustainable. Torture constitutes deliberately inflicted unbearable pain that the victim has an urgent and continually pressing desire to end. Nevertheless, we can well imagine a destitute individual agreeing to a torture contract (in order to be able to feed her child, for example). This is because her interest in subsistence is so urgent that it is liable to outweigh her interest in the object of even the right against torture. Given that the interest in subsistence is liable to outweigh the interest in the object of any other human right, this is a potential threat to the enjoyment of any other human right.

In cases of standard coercion, the threat that the coercion poses to enjoyment of other rights arises from the coercer's posing a specific threat of harm to the victim unless the victim agrees to forgo another right. By contrast, the threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other rights lies with the fact that the existing plight of the destitute is already completely unsustainable. If forgoing another right is the only available opportunity for obtaining subsistence, then the choice not to forgo the right, which will lead to the continuation of the status quo, is an unsustainable option.

This can be expressed in terms of Robert Nozick's distinction between moral and empirical baselines of harm. In his analysis of coercion, he argues that the coercer's threat of harm can be characterized relative to a moral or empirical baseline.29 Relative to the empirical baseline, a threat of harm is characterized as a proposal to make someone worse off than she would otherwise expect to be in the normal course of events. Relative to the moral baseline, by contrast, a threat is characterized as a proposal to make someone worse off than she morally ought to be. Nozick illustrates the way in which these two baselines can come apart with an example of a slave-owner who normally beats his slave each morning but on one occasion says that he will refrain from beating the slave if the slave performs a certain action. Relative to the empirical baseline, this is an offer to make the slave better off than he would normally expect to be. However, relative to the moral baseline it is a threat to beat the slave and thereby make the slave worse off than he morally ought to be unless he complies with his master's demand. The core threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other rights lies with the fact that the plight of continuing destitution is unsustainable to the point that even treatment that is severely harmful, relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline of harm, is liable to make the right-holder significantly better off than she would otherwise be, relative to the empirical baseline of continuing destitution, and is liable to significantly increase her range of options.

Thus, what underlies the threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other human rights is that for those who are destitute, their existing plight is already completely unsustainable. Furthermore, their interest in obtaining subsistence is so urgent that it is liable to outweigh their interest in the object of *any* other human right (even the right against torture), whenever forgoing that other right is the only available opportunity for obtaining subsistence. I now argue that one crucial implication of this is that the threat that subsistence exchange contracts pose to the enjoyment of other rights is common, and indeed liable to be pervasive.

## **III. The Commonness and Pervasiveness of the Threat Subsistence Exchange Contracts Pose to the Enjoyment of Other Human Rights**

In cases of standard coercion, the threat such coercion poses to the enjoyment of other rights arises from the coercer's posing a specific threat of harm to the victim unless the

<sup>29</sup> Robert Nozick, "Coercion", in Sidney Morgenbesser et al. (eds.), *Philosophy, Science and Method* (New York: St. Martin's, 1969), 447–50.

victim agrees not to exercise another right. Such threats are generally short-term and episodic. By contrast, as we have seen, the threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other rights lies with the fact that the existing plight of the destitute individual is already completely unsustainable. Inadequate subsistence poses a threat to the destitute individual's most basic interests that is just as severe as the threat posed by the most extreme standard coercion. But unlike with cases of standard coercion, in which the coercer poses a specific and generally short-term threat of harm to the victim, the threat to right-holders' basic interests posed by destitution is ongoing, and indeed likely to be life-long. Thus the option that is liable to be the most unsustainable of all is also the status quo and the default option, unless the individual finds some way of avoiding it.

For this reason, destitute individuals are continually desperate to find opportunities to obtain a subsistence income. However, given the drastic shortage of economic opportunities available to them, doing so is liable to involve having to forgo another right in exchange for subsistence. And given that inadequate subsistence is liable to be even worse than forgoing the substance of any other right, then *whenever* forgoing another right is the only way of obtaining subsistence, the right-holder is liable to be driven to forgo that other right in order to avoid the most unsustainable option of all, that of continuing destitution.

As Shue points out, it is widely recognized that prisoners are highly vulnerable to coercion by prison guards, through the threat of withholding their subsistence. The reason for this is that they are entirely dependent on the prison guards for subsistence. We may have a recalcitrant intuition that unless we are in prison, we are not dependent in this way.30 But when persons lack any realistic opportunity to earn for themselves a subsistence income, their choice situation is just as restricted as that of the prisoners. They are just as dependent for subsistence on anyone offering them an opportunity that would be otherwise unavailable for obtaining it, and are just as vulnerable to having no sustainable alternative but to forgo another right in exchange for subsistence.

This can be illustrated first by considering the torture contract itself. Although explicit torture contracts are indeed rather rare (though not so rare as to be "exotic"),31 exchanges in which individuals whose access to subsistence is insecure accept severely physically cruel treatment, because it is the only way of obtaining subsistence, are indeed common. One common example is severe domestic violence.32 If women who are experiencing such violence have no realistic opportunity to earn for themselves a subsistence income, they are vulnerable to not being in a position to exercise their right against the violence (by leaving the relationship, for example), because they are likely

<sup>30</sup> This point was suggested to me by Sarah Conly.

<sup>31</sup> Eg, prostitutes who accept the job because it is the only available opportunity for being able to obtain a subsistence income for themselves and their children are especially vulnerable to being forced to accept a high risk of sadistic abuse as inherent to their job.

<sup>32</sup> The treatment I am referring to consists in the deliberate infliction of extreme pain, motivated by cruelty and often a desire to subordinate and control the victim, and often causing permanent physical harm. Even if the classification of this treatment as torture is rejected, it is comparably serious and is widely held to be a human rights violation.

#### *Elizabeth Ashford* 529

to be entirely dependent on their husbands for subsistence. Leaving the relationship is therefore liable to jeopardize their access to subsistence. Since this cost is unsustainable, the choice of taking up their right against the violence is not one that is genuinely available to them. Until the right to subsistence has been secured, one important threat to the enjoyment of the right against domestic violence will remain: that the option of taking up the right is unsustainable, and therefore not genuinely available, because it conflicts with obtaining adequate subsistence. This is a common threat to the enjoyment of the right against domestic violence, and the threat is likely to be at least as real and severe as that posed by legal impediments to prosecuting or separating from violent partners.

Similarly, severely poor domestic workers are highly vulnerable to being forced to accept abusive treatment because of fear of their own or their children's starvation if they leave the employment. Destitute child laborers are also extremely vulnerable to severe and sadistic abuse. As Debra Satz puts it, "Millions of children are beaten, raped. . . and abused, suggesting that more than economic motives are driving employers. . .Indeed, children's lives might be much better if only the bloodless impersonal economic motives of an ideal market were at issue".33 Thus the destitute are highly vulnerable to being forced to accept extreme abuse in exchange for subsistence.

It should also be noted that another implication of the nature of the threat that destitution poses to the enjoyment of other rights is that it need not involve the individual's agreeing to a contract at all, either implicit or explicit. Thomas Pogge points out that a contract in which a destitute individual forgoes a certain human right in exchange for subsistence might not be on offer at all. Pogge gives the example of a kidnap victim, who is being starved and assaulted by his kidnappers.34 Pogge argues that the victim does not enjoy the right to subsistence (or to physical security), but that this does not plausibly undermine his enjoyment of, say, the right not to be arbitrarily deprived of a nationality, because a contract in which he forgoes such a right in exchange for subsistence is of no interest to his kidnappers.

However, as I have argued, the underlying threat to the enjoyment of other rights is posed by the fact that whenever enjoying a right comes into conflict with obtaining subsistence, the choice of enjoying the right is unsustainable. Subsistence exchange contracts are not the only context in which this conflict is likely to occur. Therefore, while Pogge is right that coercive contracts in which the right-holder forgoes a certain right in exchange for subsistence may not actually be of interest to would-be coercers and so may not be on offer, this does not entail that the threat to other rights posed by insecure access to subsistence is not in place.

This can be illustrated with Pogge's own example of the kidnap victim who is being starved by his kidnappers, but is not being coerced by them into forgoing his right to a nationality. If we take the core threat to this right to be posed by the ineligibility of continuing to lack subsistence, then it is much broader than the threat posed by

coercive contracts. While contracts in which people forgo their right to a nationality in exchange for subsistence may be rare, conflicts between obtaining adequate subsistence and enjoying the right to a nationality are far from rare. One way in which this conflict arises is that of illegal immigrants, who are forced to leave their own country because of the lack of opportunities to earn a subsistence income. Given restrictive immigration policies, applying for citizenship in the new country is highly likely to lead to deportation and to a return to the destitution from which they were fleeing, and so is not a sustainable option. These individuals therefore do not effectively enjoy the right to citizenship in the new country, and are in turn highly vulnerable to violations of the rights conferred by such citizenship, such as the right to decent working conditions. Destitution does therefore pose a standard threat to actual enjoyment of the right to a nationality.

I contend, then, that subsistence exchange contracts are indeed common. Moreover, the threat that inadequate subsistence poses to the enjoyment of other rights is liable to be much more pervasive than that posed by standard coercion. In cases of extreme standard coercion, the coercer poses a severe threat of harm in virtue of which the option of refusing to comply with the coercer's demand is rendered unsustainable. By contrast, those who are destitute face an ongoing severe threat to their most basic interests in virtue of which the existing status quo for them is completely unsustainable. Treatment that is harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline (such as torture), is liable to make them significantly better off than they would otherwise be, relative to the empirical baseline of the continuation of the status quo, whenever accepting such treatment provides the only available opportunity for obtaining subsistence.

Evidence for the frequent nature of subsistence exchange contracts is the fact that an increasingly common class of violations of widely recognized negative human rights against harmful treatment actually take the form of subsistence exchange contracts, in which people accept the harmful treatment in exchange for the opportunity to earn a subsistence income. Examples include sweatshop labor, child labor, and human smuggling. These are cases in which forgoing the right against the harmful treatment does constitute the only available opportunity for obtaining subsistence.

These subsistence exchange contracts are standardly classified as violations of negative human rights against harm. This is because they involve treatment at the hands of other agents that is severely harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline. Child labor is standardly classified as a human rights violation in large part because of the severely detrimental impact it is liable to have on children's developmental interests; it is therefore held to make them much worse off than they morally ought to be. Sweat-shop labor is also widely classified as a human rights violation, on the grounds that the unhygienic, unsafe, and exhausting working conditions endemic to sweat-shop labor are morally unacceptable. Human smuggling is widely classified as a human rights violation on the ground that people ought not be subject to an extremely high risk of death during the journey, as a result of travelling in a poorly ventilated lorry, for example.

They are also commonly classified as coercion. As I have argued, regardless of how they are classified they share two key features in common with standard coercion. First, the destitute individuals' choice of accepting the contract is non-voluntary. Second, the contracts often involve subjugation.

As I now argue, another core implication of the way in which the threat to other human rights posed by subsistence exchange contracts differs from the threat posed by standard coercion is that enforcing a ban on subsistence exchange contracts, without securing the right-holders' right to subsistence, is systemically severely detrimental to the right-holders' overall interests and range of options. This detrimental impact on the right-holder of bans on subsistence exchange contracts is illustrated particularly vividly by considering the standard response to human rights violations that actually take the form of subsistence exchange contracts.

## **IV. The Moral Inconsistency Involved in Banning Subsistence Exchange Contracts Without Securing Right-holders' Right to Subsistence**

Many subsistence exchange contracts are widely recognized as violations of negative human rights against harm, on the ground that they involve treatment at the hands of other agents that is harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline. Since the right to subsistence is, by contrast, widely held to be merely progressively realizable, the ban on these negative rights violations is generally enforced without addressing the severe poverty associated with the prevalence of such contracts. They are also widely held to constitute coercion. Accordingly, the standard response to child labor, sweat-shop labor, and so on is to seek to enforce an immediate ban without securing the victims' right to subsistence. This response is in line with the libertarian view that the only genuine human rights are negative human rights, and that these impose a secondary duty to enforce a ban on violations of them.35 But as the commonness of this response indicates, this aspect of libertarianism is widely reflected in current human rights practice. While violations of negative human rights against harmful treatment are taken to demand an immediate ban, the duty to secure right-holders' right to subsistence is generally treated as far less urgent.

35 Article 2.2 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Political Rights (ICESPR) stipulates that each state party will take "a view to achieving progressively" the rights in the Covenant in accordance with "the maximum of its available resources". This takes right-holders' own governments to be the primary addressees of the right to subsistence, responsible for fulfilling the primary positive duty to respect the right (for the distinction between the primary and secondary duties imposed by human rights, see n 12). Even where right-holders' own governments lack adequate resources to fulfill the primary positive duties imposed by the right to subsistence towards all their citizens, responsibility for fulfilling these primary duties is not held to fall on other nations. Foreign governments are held to be only under *secondary* duties "to encourage and assist countries in their efforts to respect and uphold human rights, to pressure governments that violate rights to cease doing so, and to assist the victims of rights violations" (James Nickel, "How Human Rights Generate Duties to Protect and Provide", *Human Rights Quarterly*, 15 (1993): 77–86, 85). Yet if the right to subsistence is held to be a universal human right, the relevant level of current resources should be that of global resources rather than the level of resources internal to poor countries themselves, and the relevant social institutions should be feasible global, as well as domestic, social institutions. For further defence of this, see Elizabeth Ashford, "The Duties Imposed by the Human Right to Basic Necessities", in T. Pogge (ed.), *Freedom From Poverty as a Human Right* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007), 183–218, and Pablo Gilabert, "Humanist and Political Perspectives on Human Rights", *Political Theory*, 39 (2011): 439–67.

This response overlooks the fact that the reason destitute individuals agree to subsistence exchange contracts is that they reasonably judge the continuation of the status quo—ongoing destitution—to be the most unsustainable option of all. Thus, while the contracts are agreed to non-voluntarily (in the sense that the choice is driven by the fact that every other option is unsustainable), and the treatment is harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline, the contracts also significantly improve the right-holders' overall interests and range of options. It follows that simply banning the subsistence exchange contracts without securing the right-holders' right to subsistence is systemically detrimental both to those right-holders' overall interests and to their range of options.

Let us consider first the way in which the ban impacts on right-holders' range of options. Right-holders are liable to agree to a subsistence exchange contract because it may, for example, provide an opportunity that would otherwise be unavailable for a destitute individual to afford to prevent his child from dying through lack of subsistence. Therefore coercive enforcement of a ban on the contract, without ensuring the right-holder has another realistic opportunity to earn a subsistence income, may remove his only realistic opportunity to save his child. As I argued in section II, choices that are non-voluntary in the sense that they are driven by the fact that the option of refusing is unsustainable may nevertheless be a deeply important expression of agency. Removing persons' only available opportunity to save their child's life without securing an alternative opportunity to do so is an extremely severe further restriction on their range of options, which undermines their pursuit of what they may reasonably judge to be their most important end.

The ban in some respects resembles the kind of paternalistic intervention that libertarians in particular find deeply objectionable; it is a form of intervention in the lives of right-holders that severely restricts their range of options, and is taken to be motivated by concern for the interests of the individual. However, unlike genuine paternalism, it is also systematically severely detrimental to the right-holders' overall interests.

Similarly, deaths as a result of human smuggling rightly evoke outrage. This outrage generally leads to a call to tighten up a ban on the smuggling, independently of securing the right to subsistence. However, those who pay the smugglers may be doing so because even an extremely risky attempt to escape destitution will significantly improve their chances of survival. In such cases, implementing a ban without addressing the destitution removes what may be their best available opportunity to feed themselves and their children, and is liable to substantially further reduce their chances of survival.

The impact on children of immediate bans on child labor, without addressing the background destitution, has been especially well documented. It has often led to the children's starvation, or to their being driven to a worse way of earning a subsistence income, such as prostitution.36

In common with standard violations of liberty rights against coercion and harmful treatment, the contracts are agreed to non-voluntarily and often involve subjugation,

<sup>36</sup> See, eg, Kaushik Basu and Zafiris Tzannatos, "The Global Child Labor Problem: What Do We Know and What Can We Do?", *World Bank Economic Review*, 17(2) (2003): 147–73.

and they involve treatment at the hands of other agents that is severely harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline. Nevertheless, enforcing a ban without securing right-holders' right to subsistence, far from protecting the right-holders, systemically further undermines their range of options and overall interests. This is incompatible with taking the implementation of the rights to be for the sake of the right-holder. On any plausible account of human rights, however, they are positions of normative advantage, the implementation of which must be for the sake of the right-holder. This response, therefore, is morally inconsistent.

What underlies this inconsistency is, once more, the fact that for those who are destitute, the moral and empirical baselines of harm systemically diverge. Responding to the harmful and coercive treatment by simply enforcing a ban on it puts the moral focus on the wrongfulness of the behavior of the agent inflicting such treatment, and on protecting the right-holder against such treatment. The assumption that the appropriate response to such treatment is simply to enforce a ban on it is based on the implicit assumption that the status quo is (at least minimally) acceptable. Violations of negative rights against harmful treatment are conceived as discrete harmful actions, where the harm is measured against a baseline implicitly assumed to be acceptable. The violation therefore makes the victim worse off relative to both the moral and the empirical baselines of harm. Enforcing a ban thus protects the victim against the threat to their interests posed by the would-be violator. Violations of negative rights against coercion are conceived as threats to the victims' voluntary choice and freedom from subjugation, and enforcing a ban protects right-holders against such threats.

However, the assumption that the status quo is minimally acceptable does not apply to those who are destitute. For these individuals, the moral and empirical baselines of harm systemically diverge, so that they are made significantly better off than they would otherwise be (relative to the empirical baseline) by treatment that is severely harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline, whenever accepting such treatment is the only opportunity for obtaining subsistence. Therefore enforcing a ban on the treatment without ensuring an alternative opportunity to earn a subsistence income is systemically liable to be more detrimental to the right-holder's overall interests than the treatment against which they would be "protected". And although subsistence exchange contracts are very similar to standard coercion, in that acceptance of them is equally non-voluntary and they are liable to involve subjugation, the threat to the victims' interests that renders refusing the contract an unsustainable option is posed not by the agent labeled the coercer but by the victims' ongoing destitution. Enforcing a ban on the contract does not protect the right-holder against the threat to their range of options posed by the agent labeled the coercer, but significantly further reduces the right-holder's range of options.

To sum up, I have argued that while subsistence exchange contracts significantly differ from standard coercion, the choice of accepting them is just as non-voluntary as in the most extreme cases of standard coercion. In both cases, the right-holder's choice is driven by the fact that every other option is unsustainable. The interest in subsistence is so urgent that, first, inadequate subsistence is unsustainable, and, second, it is liable to outweigh the interest in the object of *any* other right—even the right against torture. Subsistence exchange contracts therefore constitute a potential threat to the enjoyment of every other human right. Given that what underlies the threat is that for those who are destitute their existing status quo is unsustainable, the threat is liable to be common, and more pervasive than that posed by standard coercion; and responding to it by simply banning the subsistence exchange contract, without fulfilling the right-holders' right to subsistence, is liable to be systemically severely detrimental to their overall interests and range of options.

Human rights are universal moral claims held by every person. It follows that whatever human rights there are must be held by the destitute as much as anyone else. However, unless the right to subsistence is universally fulfilled, there will be one group of right-holders—the destitute—for whom the continuation of the status quo, of ongoing destitution, is liable to be worse than accepting treatment in exchange for subsistence that is severely harmful relative to an uncontroversial moral baseline, and that shares with the most extreme standard coercion the fact that agreeing to it is non-voluntary and is liable to involve subjugation.
