#### *Lorenzo Zucca*

### **I. Introduction**

In February 313, now 1,700 years ago, the Emperor Constantine signed the edict of Milan, that put an end to the persecution of Christians in the Empire. It was the first official proclamation of freedom of religion. To be more precise, since Constantine was himself Christian, and actively promoted the respect of the Christian religion in the Empire, it came to be regarded as the union between power and religion. Religion, that is Christian religion, was not only free in the Empire but came to dominate the whole moral and political space. One paradoxical effect was the denial of religious freedom for dissenters. This paved the way for religious schisms, and in fact promoted brutal confrontations between Christians. Many Christians persecuted by their fellow brothers left Europe to establish a polity with a greater freedom for differing religious views. Those who remained decided to gradually distance themselves from an understanding of religion too deeply involved in politics. The modern secular state was born out of the necessity of creating a distance between power and religion. The obvious risk that religious people run is to be persecuted again by the secular state. The right to freedom of religion is a local response against the possibility of new persecution.

The human right to freedom of religion is interpreted in radically different ways in the West. Some insist that religious people should be protected from external interferences, other insist that non-religious people should be protected from the interference of religion in public affairs. Perhaps the problem is that it is impossible to accurately define the human right to freedom of religion (HRFR). The human right to freedom of religion features in most international human rights documents. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), for example, encapsulates it in Article 18. The question here is not whether the HRFR is recognized as such, but rather what its status is in an international system of human rights.

The HRFR, more importantly, is not equally recognized in western secular states. Some constitutions give it a prominent place (the United States), others a very limited position: the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (DRMC), for example, contains a very limited recognition.1 The first amendment of the American Constitution gives a much more generous place to freedom of religion and attaches to

<sup>1</sup> Article X: 'No one shall be disquieted on account of his opinions, including his religious views, provided their manifestation does not disturb the public order established by law.'

Article XI: 'The free communication of ideas and opinions is one of the most precious of the rights of man. Every citizen may, accordingly, speak, write, and print with freedom, but shall be responsible for such abuses of this freedom as shall be defined by law.'

it a very articulated protection.2 While the American Bill of Rights carves out a clear place for religion in the constitution, the French Declaration laconically acknowledges that opinions, even religious ones, benefit from protection against prosecution. And it is only by way of analogy that we can infer that freedom of expression of thought and opinion also covers religious people. It is important to stress that this freedom of opinion is very important but in no way amounts to an independent HRFR.

How is it possible, or indeed is it possible, to distill from those disparate understandings of freedom of religion one that is common for everyone at the international level? The question is not merely theoretical, but it is of very great practical significance since a common understanding of the HRFR could be the basis for intervention in domestic affairs of national sovereign states in case of major violations at least. However, I find it difficult to pin down a sufficiently precise meaning of the HRFR; and as a consequence my suggestion is that the HRFR has a very limited role to play at the international level.

There are several reasons for this. To begin with the nature of freedom of religion depends heavily on historical contingencies at the domestic level (section II). Moreover, the practice of freedom of religion shows that the scope and strength of the right can only be determined in relation to the local understanding of religion and what it means to be free for a religion. As a result, supranational institutions adjudicate on these issues by displaying a great deference to national institutions that are better positioned to evaluate local practices (section III). One has to add to that that at the international level, lacking an institutional system that can resolve disputes, the role of human rights in general, and that of the HRFR more specifically, is limited and has to take into account respect for national sovereignty, which is very important in practice. The way in which national sovereignty is limited depends on the way religious freedom is conceived, but it might be impossible to conceive of it at the international level without imposing a unilateral understanding of what religion amounts to (section IV). It is therefore concluded that even if the HRFR is emphatically declared at the international level, it has a very limited status in practice.

#### **II. The Nature of Freedom of Religion**

Few dispute the status of freedom of speech, and everyone can see why it is important to let everyone express herself in a democracy, even if we don't know exactly where the protection of free speech ends. With religion things are different because people disagree as to whether religion deserves special protection, and nobody agrees on what exactly religion covers. In other words the questions '*why that freedom?*' and '*freedom of what?*' remain highly contested. To those questions one can add '*freedom for whom*?' Is it freedom for religious people in general or is it freedom of religion for neglected minorities? The fourth question is '*what kind of freedom?*': is it freedom

<sup>2</sup> 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'

from religion—to protect the state from interference, or is it freedom for religion—to help religion maintain a place and role within society?

Theories of freedom of religion attempt to answer all those questions. Those theories attempt to give an account of the status of freedom of religion in a state.3 The answers to those questions depend on highly contingent factors such as the outlook of the society and the precise constitutional history of a country. It is difficult to distill from local experiences a theory of freedom of religion that could suit the international community at large. Philosophical sophistication and abstraction do not cut much ice in this area since freedom of religion poses fundamental questions that are fraught with contingent assumptions concerning the nature of religion and the cognitive realm of theology. In this section I will explore to what extent freedom of religion is dependent on contingent factors which put into doubt the possibility of a human right to freedom of religion at the international level.

#### **A.╇ Society**

The status of freedom of religion in a state closely depends on the way in which religion is perceived and practiced in the relevant society. The American and French human rights movements were coming from deeply different societies from a religious viewpoint. American pilgrims were fleeing Europe because of its religious persecutions. There was there a germ of a plural religious society. France was trying to break from the ties of the *Ancien Regime*, which had entrenched one religion as part of its own aristocracy. Thus in a religious society, the special status of freedom of religion is simply assumed, whereas it is deeply contested in a society that wants to break free from the domination of one religion. In the United States, freedom of religion is paramount, while it is at best secondary in France.

One thing is clear, though. Freedom of religion is not a central preoccupation of theocratic regimes. It was not a central preoccupation for absolutist France nor for Britain in the seventeenth century. When the state supports one religion, it also tries to demote other religions; at best other religions will be tolerated, at worst they will be banned. And it is not a central preoccupation of modern theocracies such as Iran. So for example, the Iranian Constitution entrenches immutable establishment of Islam (Article 12),4 and only recognizes a handful of other religions as official minorities who have a qualified freedom to perform their rites and ceremonies (Article 13).5 Interestingly, the Iranian Constitution recognizes that other non-Muslims are owed respect for their human rights (Article 14).6 But if you read Articles 13 and 14 together,

<sup>3</sup> C. Laborde, 'Equal Liberty, Non-establishment and Religious Freedom,' *Legal Theory* 20(1), March 2014: 52–77.

<sup>4</sup> Article 12: 'The official religion of Iran is Islam and the Twelver Ja'fari school [in usual al-Din and fiqh], and this principle will remain eternally immutable . . . . '

<sup>5</sup> Article 13: 'Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities, who, within the limits of the law, are free to perform their religious rites and ceremonies, and to act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education.'

<sup>6</sup> Article 14: 'In accordance with the sacred verse; ('God does not forbid you to deal kindly and justly with those who have not fought against you because of your religion and who have not expelled you from your homes' [60:8]), the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and all Muslims are duty-bound to

#### *Lorenzo Zucca* 391

you can conclude that only few official religious minorities have a qualified freedom of religion. Other non-Muslims may see their human rights respected, but amongst those human rights, we have to infer that the HRFR has at best a very limited place.

Freedom of religion has, for a long time, been a Euro–Atlantic preoccupation; there is however a crucial difference between Europe and the United States: in Europe, the presence of religion in a society has traditionally being organized along the lines drawn by the treaty of Westphalia, which engineered religiously homogeneous societies with a dominant religion. Where one religion was dominant, all the others were at best tolerated. This artificial device led to a slow but progressive secularization of societies, which became disaffected from the one dominant religion. Freedom of religion was just a dormant concern from the past, which was rekindled only very recently because of the presence of new religious minorities. In the United States, the society aspires to be religiously plural, albeit not perfectly so. The point of religious freedom is to protect and promote a plurality of religious faiths in the society, while keeping the state free from the interference of any one religion in particular.

It is only recently that Europe has had to reconsider the status of freedom of religion, precisely because of major social changes due to massive immigration. Thus, each European state has had to grapple with various claims from diverse minorities from North Africa, South America, the Middle East, and Asia. When minorities do not integrate into the mainstream society, they are highly motivated to use religious identity as an explanation of diversity. Freedom of religion thus becomes the individual right through which religious minorities claim autonomy from what they perceive as a highly secularized mainstream society.

Despite the differences between the American and the European models, what is clear is that freedom of religion is relevant when the society displays great religious plurality. In these pluralistic societies, the status of freedom of religion is assumed to be important rather than being fully justified. There is no real attempt to answer the four questions I sketched earlier (freedom of what/why that freedom/freedom for whom/what kind of freedom), since answers to those questions depend on contingent societal factors and on constitutional practice.

#### **B.╇ Religious freedom and constitutional assumptions**

The American constitutional experiment is the first attempt to separate religion from politics, not with the intent of removing religion from society, but on the contrary with the intent of protecting freedom of conscience for every individual.7 In contrast with that project, France has attempted to separate religion from politics in order to free the whole society from religious influence in the public sphere.8 Thus, we have two

treat non-Muslims in conformity with ethical norms and the principles of Islamic justice and equity, and to respect their human rights. This principle applies to all who refrain from engaging in conspiracy or activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran.'

different models of separation: one is bilateral separation with the intent of preserving religion from the corruption of politics (the United States). The other is unilateral, with the intent of preserving the state from the corruption of religion (France). Within the first model, freedom of religion is dominant. Within the second model, freedom of religion is residual. The way in which freedom of religion is conceived depends on the complex relation between societies and politics on one hand, and church and state on the other.

The separation between state and church is chiefly an historical doctrine but one which happens to have major consequences. First of all, the idea of separation implies the existence of two separate cognitive domains working independently one from the other. To recognize the existence of an independent domain is tantamount to acknowledging that that domain is important and worthy of special consideration. Moreover, the religious domain determines its own identity and scope. So here's a paradoxical consequence of any form of separation: the state does not know the religious reasons, but respects them as such, refraining from interference.9

Constitutional theories of freedom of religion do not address our four questions directly, but only do so implicitly.10 To begin with, the mere fact of mentioning freedom of religion in a constitutional text assumes that freedom of religion is special and important*—*in US constitutional history not only is freedom of religion mentioned but it is in the first amendment, supporting the belief that it is amongst the most important freedoms. Unfortunately, the text does not explain why religion deserves special protection by comparison to other human activities. Moreover, the text does not say what amounts to religion, so the only way of working that out is by looking at constitutional practice, in particular adjudication. This point corroborates the idea that freedom of religion is highly dependent on contingent factors and is quite difficult to export. Finally, the way in which constitutional practice works is coherentist rather than critical. This means that constitutional actors and theorists try to make sense of past decisions with an eye to preserving and explaining the values that constitute society from the beginning and that are typically declared in constitutions. So the mere fact that freedom of religion features in the constitutional text is a reason strong enough to consider it as special and important from the constitutional viewpoint.

Thus in practice, judges often treat freedom of religion in a special way without knowing what religion is about and without asking why it is special.11 If you show that your claim is religious, then you have a pro tanto reason to have your claim protected. The main way to establish what amounts to a religious claim as opposed to any other claim is by way of analogy with mainstream conceptions of religion within a society. Freedom of religion is especially important but its nature cannot be investigated.

Some constitutional theories of freedom of religion attempt to challenge the paradigm of freedom of religion as an individual human right that provides pro tanto reasons to defeat governmental policies.12 They argue instead that freedom of religion

<sup>11</sup> Laborde, 'Equal Liberty, Non-establishment and Religious Freedom'.

#### *Lorenzo Zucca* 393

should be understood as an equal liberty of conscience, that is to say that whoever has a strong enough claim of conscience*—*be they religious or non-religious people*—*should have a defense against discrimination on the basis of their beliefs. In this case you don't have to show that your claim is religious, but that your claim is deep enough or is vulnerable.13 The problem with these constitutional theories is that they merely displace the burden of assumptions concerning the nature and role of religion.14 Indeed, practice shows that there is an assumption that religious people have deep and vulnerable claims, whereas non-religious people will have to show why that is the case.

Constitutional theories deal, implicitly or explicitly, with two separate and inescapable queries: first, is religion special? Second, what kind of treatment does it deserve? There is no answer to the first question; it is simply assumed that freedom of religion is in some way special since it is mentioned in most constitutions. This of course informs its treatment, which amounts at times to qualified privilege and at others to qualified burden.

#### **C.╇ The ontology and epistemology of religion**

Philosophical explanations of freedom of religion seem to suffer from the same problem as constitutional theories. They are not capable of distilling one definition of religion that explains in non-religious terms the special importance of religion for the sake of its protection. Indeed many believe that we ought not delve into the trap of defining religion since a definition could always be under- or over-inclusive. Many attempts have been made but with very limited success: it is in fact common to suggest that no definition is possible.15 In fact most lawyers and philosophers agree that a definition of religion is a thankless exercise. Instead they propose criteria or paradigmatic cases to use in analogical fashion. By doing this, they also implicitly accept that religion should be apprehended on a case-by-case basis and with an eye to the local contingencies that shape practice.

Brian Leiter is nearly unique in his effort at providing a simple straightforward definition of religion that aims to capture any possible religious phenomena. The ambition is to provide a universally valid, and simple, definition of religion.16 Leiter offers two elements, which he regards as central: categoricity of belief and insulation from evidence.17 Categoricity refers to the stringency of beliefs in guiding behavior. Insulation from evidence addresses the way in which religion relates to the knowledge of the world that we have on the basis of common sense or science. Religion, being based on faith, is not responsive to reason, Leiter argues, and this insulates religion from the requirement of evidential proofs.

<sup>13</sup> The claim is deep when it is part of a worldview that the individual follows in a consistent way. It is vulnerable when it is held by minorities that do not have an easy access to mainstream society.

<sup>14</sup> Laborde, 'Equal Liberty, Non-establishment and Religious Freedom'.

<sup>15</sup> W.F. Sullivan, *The Impossibility of Religious Freedom* (Princeton University Press, 2007).

<sup>16</sup> B. Leiter, *Why Tolerate Religion?* (Princeton University Press, 2012). This began as a reply to Martha Nussbaum's avowedly local, *Liberty of Conscience*.

<sup>17</sup> Leiter, *Why Tolerate Religion?,* 27.

There is no space here to address this view critically, but a few comments are in order. Leiter assesses religion from the viewpoint of an exclusively naturalistic worldview, which presupposes a conflict between science and religion. To assess the cogency of this conflict one would have to provide an accurate account of the naturalistic worldview,18 that is a view according to which the world described by scientific laws is all there is to know. This assumption creates a fundamental problem for Leiter's definition as it presents faith as necessarily fallible, as if there was scientific evidence to prove that claim. In Leiter's account, faith is the source of unwarranted beliefs, as they cannot be supported by scientific evidence, indeed they are insulated from it. But this assumes too much, namely that all the beliefs we hold on the basis of faith are incompatible with scientific evidence. This cannot be true, in particular in relation to moral beliefs that are inherited from religious convictions. It also assumes wrongly that those religious beliefs that are incompatible with scientific evidence cannot be revised or put aside. But again people of faith and religious institutions are prepared, albeit at times reluctantly, to change their beliefs on the strength of contrary scientific evidence.

I also note that Leiter's definition is consistent with the idea of separation between theology and other domains of knowledge. In other words, Leiter's definition preserves an epistemic integrity to the domain of religion, by isolating faith as the source of religious knowledge. Epistemic integrity postulates a distinction between public reason and religious reason.19 Integrity thus conceived cuts both ways. On the one hand, it excludes religion from participation in the discussion of public policies. On the other, it recognizes the dignity of religious reasons as being different in nature from public reasons.

Since religious reasons are sovereign in their domain according to this perspective, it follows that philosophy has a very limited role to play in providing a definition of a practice that defines itself. Moreover, the question: 'what is religion?' for the purpose of determining the right-holders and the content of the right is an altogether different question from 'what is speech?' Secular institutions are notoriously ill equipped to answer the former question. Partly this is because secular institutions do not have the theological training required to examine the problem. Partly it is because secular law encapsulates an understanding of evidence that is not compatible with the proofs that religious people may put forward in order to establish the genuineness of their beliefs. On top of all that the question: 'what is religion?' can be broken down into many difficult quandaries. The broadest underlying problem concerns the kind of object that religion is, that is its nature, or ontology, so to speak.

But even assuming that domestic secular institutions can come up with a working definition of religion so as to guarantee respect for freedom of religion, that definition is based on local contingencies that militate against the possibility of a universal definition of religion. These brief considerations highlight the puzzles that one necessarily

<sup>18</sup> A. Plantinga, *Where the Conflict Really Lies*—*Science, Religion, and Naturalism* (Oxford University Press, 2012. Plantinga, eg, shows that the conflict as presented by holders of a naturalistic worldview is only apparent and not real, after careful examination.

faces when trying to pin down the meaning of the HRFR in Western states. This is not to mention the difficulties related to non-Western states, difficulties that are even greater.

When a policy maker has to grapple with problems of religious freedom, she is bound to face two extraordinarily complicated problems:

- (1) What is the nature of the right to freedom of religion?
- (2)How does one know what counts as religion across the world if one begins with one's own local conception of religion?

The practice of the human right to freedom of religion highlights that each legal political system has in-built assumptions that depend on historical contingencies. Moreover, as will be seen in the next section, that is a reason for supranational and international institutions to display a great degree of caution in matters that have to do with the domestic treatment of freedom of religion.

## **III. The Practice of Freedom of Religion**

What emerges so far is that freedom of religion is characterized by a very strong local contingency. This is a central consideration when we attempt to pin down the meaning of the international human right to freedom of religion. The practice of freedom of religion also shows that domestic institutions are reluctant to enter into theological debates as to the nature of religion, for obvious reasons. They prefer instead to use sociological and anthropological criteria to address the question.20 The practice of freedom of religion also clearly shows that supranational and international judges adopt a very deferential stance toward domestic religious litigations.

Freedom of religion is not an absolute right at the national level, even when it has pride of place like in the US Constitution. Even so, its treatment in practice displays a number of legal problems with which policy makers and the judiciary are confronted. In general, the legal treatment of freedom of religion presents three distinct puzzles that contribute to its limitation in practice. One has to determine the scope, the strength, and the way to deal with conflicts between freedom of religion and other rights.

#### **A.╇ Scope**

To determine the scope of protection afforded by a human right one has to engage in several different steps. First, one has to translate the broad statement of principle into deontic modalities (prohibitions/permissions/obligations).21 So, for example, the US Constitution prohibits on the one hand the making of laws that establish one religion, and on the other the making of laws prohibiting the free exercise of one's own religion (here the prohibition of a prohibition must be read as a broad permission).

Secondly, one has to establish the correlative duty imposed on other people by virtue of the existence of a right.22 At the constitutional level, generally speaking a liberty

<sup>22</sup> W.N. Hohfeld, *Fundamental Legal Conceptions* (Aldershot, 2001).

protected by claim rights is correlated with the absence of a right on the part of other persons. This means very blandly that if I have a right to exercise my religion in the private sphere, nobody has a right to curtail my right by violating my private space. Surely the HRFR also implies a more general immunity on the part of the right-holder which corresponds with a disability on the part of the state. For example, the American legislator is prime duty-bearer of the HRFR, and this entails a constitutional disability to make laws that prohibit free exercise of religion.

Thirdly, and much more controversially, in order to decide the actual scope of prohibitions and the extent to which the legislator is disabled one has to work out what kind of beliefs and behaviours are to be classified as religious. Looking at both the US and French texts, we can readily see that there is great difference as to the religiously inspired behavior that is covered by constitutional articles. In the United States, free exercise forms the core of the protection, while in France what is protected is religious belief. If we compare the two, there is a striking difference between protection of religious thought and protection of acts based on religious thinking. So the distinction between speech and act is an important dividing line between the regime of protection in America and in France.

Another possible dividing line, perhaps even more important, is between freedom of religion understood as an individual or as a group right. The idea of free exercise has been interpreted as leaning towards the protection of individual conscience rather than the protection of religious groups. In fact, on this point it is clear that the American state attempts to avoid supporting any religious group as far as possible, even if they obviously have the freedom to gather together to celebrate religious rituals. But the basis of religious assembly can still be found in the individual act of conscience rather than being derivative from a special status of religious organizations. Thus in the United States, religious conscience is the basic element for the recognition and protection of some religious beliefs and acts.

In revolutionary France, the text only mentions religious opinions. In both cases, there seems to be an accent on the individual experience but we have to draw an important distinction between conscience on one side, and thought and opinion on the other. Conscience clearly covers both belief and action, while opinions can hardly be stretched to cover actions. There is a big difference between conscience and thought; the former functions like a sword, whereas thought (or opinion) is more of a shield. In other words, once the existence of religious claims of conscience can be established it seems as if an exemption from ordinary law might be requested. In the case of religious opinion, the only concern seems to create a private space shielded from the interference of ordinary law, but in no way does religious opinion seem to be entitled to claim an exemption from ordinary law.

It is only with more recent human rights treaties that the scope of the right to freedom of religion covers a collective aspect. In particular the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), Article 9 states:

1. Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience *and religion*; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private to manifest his religion or belief, in worship, teaching, practice and observance [emphasis added].

The European formulation goes well beyond conscience and thought and spans from that individual dimension to a much more collective one. It also moves beyond the private sphere to cover the public aspect of religion.

#### **B.╇ Strength**

In determining the strength of the HRFR, one has to compare the strength of other rights *in abstracto*; it is also necessary to single out the importance of religious practices within a society; and finally one has to compare the freedom of different religious groups between themselves.

Some American commentators see a paradoxical treatment of religion.23 Free exercise receives special protection, and thus religious conscience has special force in comparison to other claims of conscience, whereas establishment is the object of special burdens, and therefore religion as a collective enterprise has lesser strength than other collective activities. In France, according to the DRMC, religious opinions are protected at the same level as other opinions, but certainly not more so. So in this sense, religious opinions receive equal treatment. As far as religious groups are concerned, France allows itself the possibility to interfere with them whenever it deems it suitable. In both cases we talk about separation between church and state, but in fact in America it is bilateral separation while in France it is unilateral separation.

The ECHR admits of systems of separation and establishment, so the strength of the interest protected by freedom of religion should be evaluated *in different contexts*. But it is important to note one thing at the outset: if one religion is established *de jure* then it goes without saying that there is a presumption of more favorable treatment of that religion over others. Establishment does not promote equality between religions, and can easily undermine the freedom of all other religions.

So another interesting problem is the following: when a state establishes one religion, it may very well undermine the freedom of other religions. *Kokkinakis*, the first case to reach the Strasbourg court, is precisely about asserting the freedom of religion of Jehovah's witnesses in Greece, where the Orthodox Church is constitutionally established and, in this specific case, one side effect of that establishment is a prohibition on proselytism resulting in a criminal offence.24

*De jure* establishment, however, does not automatically mean that only one religion enjoys the benefit of constitutional protection. In the United Kingdom, *de jure* establishment goes hand in hand with a constant concern to offer equal benefits to a vast array of other religions.25 Conversely, *de jure* separation does not prevent altogether the possibility of *de facto* establishment or at least a strict collaboration

<sup>24</sup> *Kokkinakis v. Greece*, Application No. 14307/88, Judgement of 25 May 1993.

<sup>25</sup> J. Rivers, *The Law of Organized Religion. Between Establishment and Secularism* (Oxford University Press, 2010).

between state and one church, as is the case in Italy between the state and the Vatican. This means that one religion enjoys very special benefits, while other may be treated comparatively much less favorably. For example, freedom of religion for Muslims in Italy does not meet with great legal protection nor with public enthusiasm, which results in a series of administrative burdens to prevent them from building religious places of worship.26

An important concern one faces when determining the strength of the interest protected by religious freedom is the issue of whether or not we are talking about equal freedom for all religions or whether one religion is treated better than others.27 The main concern, though, is about the strength of the interest of religious freedom within a system of plural rights. Religious freedom in the United States seems at first glance a central concern of the Constitution since it is placed at the very front of the bill of rights and is the object of an elaborated set of norms. In the French DRMC, there is no article devoted to religious freedom and religion is only mentioned in passing so it is clear that its status, and the strength of the interest resulting from it, is much less important.

In the ECHR, freedom of religion has an independent place amongst derogable rights. So we know that other rights such as freedom from torture, and the right to life have a greater strength at least insofar that they are to be considered non-derogable, that is to say there is no interest that can prevail over them. *A contrario*, it is clear that there may be a number of interests that can prevail over the interest protected by freedom of religion and paragraph 2 of Article 9 ECHR is there to confirm this.

2. Freedom to manifest one's religion or beliefs shall be subject only to such limitations as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

Freedom of religion as embedded in the ECHR has a very broad scope, since it covers thought, conscience, and religion. Thus, it covers both individual and collective beliefs and behavior based on those beliefs. However, the strength of the right is limited and limitable on the ground of paragraph 2 of the same Article 9. The strength of the interest protected by freedom of religion can be limited on the basis of interests of public safety, for the protection of public order, health or morals, and finally—last but not least—for the protection of the rights and freedom of others. Also it is important to note at this stage that scope and strength are linked in a relationship of inverse proportionality: the wider the scope of protection, the lesser the strength, and vice versa. If the scope was very narrow, then one could always argue that it was a matter of preserving the very core of the right. See Table 21.1.

|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|

#### **C.╇ Conflicts**

The most difficult cases of limitations are those of conflicts between the right to freedom of religion and other rights. As pointed out earlier, and as a matter of law, freedom of religion can be limited in order to guarantee the promotion and protection of other rights. Examples of such conflicts are multiple, but we cannot discuss them all. Here we can only sketch the contours of the problem.

Freedom of religion can conflict with other freedoms, such as for example freedom of expression. It may be argued that in plural democratic societies, people are free to express negative judgments about religious practices, including judgments that are offensive. After all, if protected expression was only positive expression, then there wouldn't be any need to proclaim such freedom. But it can also be argued that offensive opinion concerning religious minorities can undermine the respect of the whole community towards religious minorities as well as undermining the status of that minority within a wider society. In other words, offensive speech can easily polarize societies and create huge social tension within and outside the national territory. A common example of this scenario is the Muhammad cartoon saga.

This issue is, I think, all the more exacerbated if we look at the European Court of Human Rights' *Otto Preminger* case, where the artistic expression of a movie director was limited on the ground that the movie could offend the religious majority in the Tyrol region.28 The Court reasoned that the interference with the applicant association's freedom of expression was proscribed by law but the seizure and forfeiture of the film were aimed at 'the protection of the rights of others', namely the right to respect for one's religious feelings, and at ensuring religious peace. The Court assessed the conflicting interests of the exercise of two fundamental freedoms guaranteed under the Convention and concluded that the Austrian authorities had not overstepped their margin of discretion. It is not clear whether the same protection would be afforded to religious feelings of a minority as in the case of Mohammed cartoons.

In any event, what matters here is to highlight that we have two specific problems: first, one has to determine whether the right to respect for one's religious feelings is within the scope of freedom of religion. Secondly, whether that right is strong enough to prevail over freedom of expression. Both questions are determined by the judge who takes the conflict of rights as an instance of a very hard case which justifies

<sup>28</sup> *Otto-Preminger-Institut v. Austria* (13470/87) [1994] ECHR 26 (20 September 1994).

an increased power to decide the case on the basis of her own assumptions about the nature and value of religion.

Another set of conflicts concerns more closely the very nature of freedom of religion. At issue is whether religion, as an established societal practice of institutions, can discriminate against some categories of people that are normally protected against discrimination. The abstract conflict is between equality and liberty.

This conflict is particularly difficult as it may put a great pressure on religions to adapt to societal standards that religion is desperately trying to resist. The conflict takes place in different settings, however the workplace is a perfect example of a domain where the fight against discrimination has been strong recently, at least in Europe.29 So if religion enters the workplace, the tension between non-discrimination and liberty of religion is more visible.

There are in fact various tensions. The employer may be secular, and employees may wish to wear religious symbols;30 in this case the discrimination is against religious people. The employer may also be the state or a public authority, and the employee may be in a situation in which she refuses to carry out basic public functions that are at odds with some religious precepts that are discriminatory.31 Or the employer may be religious and dismiss the employee who does not meet some religious standards.32 Assuming that churches can employ whomever they want, is it possible to fire people who don't meet some religious precepts that would normally be seen as discriminatory?

In other words, when religion engages in a secular employment contract, does that make the religious workplace free from the constraints applicable to the non-religious workplace? Again we have a problem of scope: to what extent does freedom of religion color the activities in which religion engages? And a problem of strength: to what extent does the special protection of freedom of religion prevail over other constitutionally entrenched interests such as non-discrimination? The answers to these questions are not written in stone, and depend heavily on very contingent and local understandings of the nature and value of religion in a discrete society. This simple fact must caution us against the temptation of acting abroad in the name of our own contingent and local convictions about the human right to freedom of religion, and also explains the cautious attitude of supranational courts that display a great deference when it comes to freedom of religion.

#### **D.╇ Margin of appreciation**

The upshot of the previous discussion is that international institutions that adjudicate on matters of religious freedom face considerable problems that derive from the contingent and local nature of that freedom. It is clear that domestic institutions are seen as being better positioned to evaluate the attitude that the state should take vis-a-vis religion. Even when there is an established regional system of protection of human rights, the human right to freedom of religion seems to be one of the most controversial issues. European states accept interference to a limited extent. The European Court of Human Rights began to make use of Article 9 only in 1993, that is, in the last two decades. All other rights have been adjudicated upon since the very creation of the Court. It can be argued that the Court is attempting to set up a marketplace of religions by countering obvious obstacles to religious pluralism, as might have been the case in *Kokkinakis* (1993) where the Greek Constitution prohibited any form of proselytism. Strasbourg intervened to lift the ban in order for other religions not to be restricted in their freedom.

The point of the marketplace of religion is to lessen the monopolistic hegemony of one religion, especially when domination is exercised in a coercive way, ie, through criminalization. But it certainly does not involve the promotion of equal liberty in the sense of protecting all religions at the same level. To do so, it would have to engineer a profound change of society, which cannot possibly be done through law. The example of Turkey shows that even when the constitution attempts to engineer a secular change, a religious backlash is always possible.

The latest decision seems to recognize a great freedom on the part of the state to decide to what extent its identity is dependent on religious symbols.33 If anything the European Court of Human Rights has taken a very deferential stance towards national sovereignty: the core principle is that the national state is sovereign when it comes to the definition of its symbols of identity. The human right to freedom of religion is in practice very limited at the supranational level. Given this very clear stance, it is hard to square this position with the idea of having a very aggressive foreign policy in the name of freedom of religion. If that was not the case, it would amount to another double standard according to which the European nations can see their sovereignty respected while non-European nations can be the object of intrusive interventions in the moralizing name of the human right to freedom of religion.

### **IV. The Status of the Human Right to Freedom of Religion**

We have learned so far that: (1) the definition of the HRFR is deeply local and contingent, and (2) international judicial institutions display deference on matters of freedom of religion at best and at worst there is no centralized institution that has the power to interpret that right so as to apply it in the international context. Moreover,

<sup>33</sup> Grand Chamber *Lautsi v Italy*, Application no. 30814/06.

any reason for intervention grounded on the HRFR must be weighed against the interest of any state to the respect of its national sovereignty. In light of this we can try to make sense of the fact that the HRFR is the object of many international declarations, but in practice makes very little difference. In other words, its status amongst other human rights is limited as a matter of practice.

#### **A.╇ Freedom of religion as an international human right**

Freedom of religion features prominently in international documents. The UDHR makes it one of the core rights in Article 18: 'Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance.' The UDHR is followed by a plethora of international documents that deal with freedom of religion. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights 1966 (ICCPR) reiterates the same formula used in the UDHR and adds other dispositions that cover prohibition against discrimination on religious grounds and the right of parents to control the religious education of their children. The Covenant also offers a catch-all definition of freedom of religion that includes theistic and non-theistic religions, and it is obviously largely over-inclusive since any form of conviction can pass muster.

Perhaps the most lavish text on freedom of religion is the United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of all Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief 1981. Articles 1 and 6 protect a great panoply of actions of worship and religious behavior that are too long to report in detail.34 Finally the 1989 concluding document encapsulates recommendations from the UDHR, the ICCPR, and the 1981 Declaration. There is hardly another human right that receives more textual recognition.

However, it must be very clear that all those documents are not legally binding on states unless they are formally incorporated into domestic law. The United States, for example, has not made them legally binding. These texts have at best the moral force of persuasion but no legal sanction is attached. Moreover, it is hard to pin down exactly the force of the moral argument since religion is defined very broadly in the ICCPR and is not defined at all in the 1981 Declaration, which brings us back to square one: domestic states have considerable freedom in managing the way in which they understand and treat religion. Indeed practice shows that religious people are still very much the object of all forms of discrimination in many countries.

We saw that in some states freedom of religion is central to the constitutional project, while it is clearly not in other states. It is therefore impossible to claim that freedom of religion is universally recognized as a strong right at the national level; it follows that it is impossible to claim that the HRFR should be regarded as fundamental to the

<sup>34</sup> See for a useful guide D. Davis, 'The Evolution of Religious Freedom as a Universal Human Right: Examining the Role of the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief,' BYULR (2002): 217–35.

international project of human rights and for this reason can hardly be regarded as a strong ground of intervention at the international level.

International human rights are a widely used currency, but they only apply in a limited way. When we try to make sense of the fast-developing practice of human rights, it is possible to distinguish between human rights that have an impact on national sovereignty and those that are only a matter of noble declaration without serious sanctions or precise moral pressure attached to it. The HRFR falls into the second category: the panoply of texts and good intentions is not followed by an international regime of protection that is capable of identifying with precision instances in which the right should be protected and sanctions attached to its violation.

#### **B.╇ Foundations**

The relationship between international human rights and religion is ambivalent. Starting with the grounding of human rights: there seem to be two broad families of theories that attempt to ground human rights—one is secular and the other religious. In order to make a difference both theories must provide reasons that are strong enough to outweigh arguments from national sovereignty, and this implies that the ethical conception of human rights should provide a minimum threshold beyond which intervention is justified.35 The problem with ethical conceptions is that they are not substantive enough to provide a clear, applicable, understanding of what that minimum threshold is.36 Ethical conceptions of human rights may point to what it is impermissible to do to religious people but they never give a full account of what kind of violations of the HRFR warrant the limitation of national sovereignty.

So for example, a theocratic regime may not be compatible with the HRFR, but this is hardly an argument for intervention at the international level. Respect for national sovereignty is compatible with the idea of having a theocratic regime. If democracy means anything, then the people of one nation can surely decide to have their decisions vetted by religious leaders. This is not to say that it is a desirable thing, but it is compatible with what people can choose.

Religious theories of human rights start from similar premises and argue that we have to be protected simply in virtue of being human beings because we have been made in the image of god. But these theories often fail to account for the fact that some human beings have lost their god-like image and therefore are not worthy of being right-holders any more.37 Other candidates are offered: Religion claims to provide a universal ethical foundation to human rights in the name of the love of god. Others claim that an ethical religious foundation can coincide with a secular one,

<sup>35</sup> J. Raz, 'Human Rights Without Foundations', in S. Besson and J. Tasioulas (eds.), *Philosophy of International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2010).

<sup>36</sup> Even at the national level human rights do not usher in a conclusive ethical worldview. If anything, they bracket it out of the picture. So it is not possible to claim that human rights are important because they have—or they provide—a strong ethical foundation. The protection of the HRFR in each society is a political question, not an ethical one, and this is all the more true at the international level.

<sup>37</sup> N. Wolterstorff, *Understanding Liberal Democracy*—*Essays in Political Philosophy* (Oxford University Press, 2012).

such as for example brotherhood.38 However, the problem does not lie with the difference between secular and religious foundations; the problem lies with the very idea of there being an ethical foundation that is universal and that explains all human rights in a univocal way. As we pointed out earlier, ethical foundations are unlikely to explain the emerging practice of human rights and they also seem to lack a necessary critical punch to help improve on the practice as it evolves.

Besides secular and religious foundational theories of human rights that attempt to ground human rights in a secular or religious argument, there are theories that deny the need for foundations, which I find more promising at this level of debate and practice.39 These theories do not deny that there may be ethical foundations to human rights. Rather, they claim that given the present practice of human rights, it is not possible to spell out one precise ethical foundation that illuminates the practice or provides a helpful critical standard.40 The practice of human rights is evolving at a fast pace and does not point to any conclusive argument as to the moral status of human rights. Human rights protect important interests that receive legal protection to the extent that they are not limited by other more important interests. Human rights have two levels, one which is domestic, and the other which is international.

The HRFR is more stringent at the national level for all the reasons advanced earlier in this chapter. To a large extent the meaning of freedom of religion is deeply dependent on the social role of religion at the national level. It is therefore a deeply contingent relationship between a society and its state, and cannot be evaluated fairly from an external standpoint. In addition to that, I agree with Raz that human rights themselves are very much dependent 'on the contingencies of the current system of international relations.'41 It is in this sense that human rights lack a foundation, that is, their practice cannot be described as being grounded in a fundamental moral concern.

If you put together the contingency with regard to the relation between religion and society in every state, with the contingency due to the place of human rights in international relations, then what emerges is a very fragile picture of the human rights to freedom of religion. To which one has to add that religion as an object can hardly be defined in a way that is universal in any meaningful way. Religion seems to escape any definition, and when it does not that definition relies on very specific assumptions.

#### **C.╇ Freedom of religion and foreign policy**

Western states often justify military intervention on the ground of human rights breaches without acknowledging that the understanding of a human right may be very much dependent on contingent presuppositions. There is a difference between the human right not to be tortured and the human right to freedom of religion. The former can be defined and nobody would object to the need to remove that violation. The latter is not objectively definable and not all violations are likely to be a ground strong

enough for intervention. That is very much the view of international judicial bodies that, as we saw, give considerable margin of appreciation to national authorities.

Moreover, more serious violations such as persecution and killing are covered by less controversial human rights such as the right to life or the right to freedom of expression. The point is that unless the HRFR is precisely defined in scope and strength, it cannot add very much either at the moral or at the legal level. And in addition to that, a biased conception of the HRFR has many risks, starting from the highly polarizing politicization of the role of religion in politics. The European Union is hardly capable of managing religious diversity within its territory; it is really unthinkable that it would erect itself as a promoter of freedom of religion in the world.

Regional and international systems of protection of human rights present differences as to the way in which national sovereignty is respected. The organized system of European human rights allows for the intervention of the European Court of Human Rights as a means of sanctioning member states. Human rights in general are those rights that can justify international intervention against violators.42 But what is fundamentally flawed is the attempt to launch a foreign policy that attempts to promote a skewed understanding of freedom of religion—something that rides roughshod over local understanding and practices.

However, the United States and Europe are often very keen to use freedom of religion as a ground for intervention in foreign policy. Since the Constantinian union between the church and state in 313, religion has been used for various political endeavors and in particular to give a moral aspect to the intervention of the Empire. Colonialist intervention has often been justified on those grounds, and examples can be multiplied: think of the military intervention in Mali to counter the religious extremists. Colonial powers have supported the worst dictators in the name of freedom of religion. The Assad family, Sadam Hussein, Mubarak, and Gaddafi have all been supported by the West because they could guarantee more or less secular regimes that would fight against the alleged threat of religious extremists. The United States has tried to play a strong role in the area of religious freedom as a matter of international policy. The most obvious problem is that action is guided not by an international—universal—understanding of the HRFR but by a very domestic one. The obvious result is that foreign policies and international relations based on very local and contingent understanding of human rights are likely to divide rather than to unite.

### **V. Conclusion**

The HRFR has a limited place within a system of international human rights for several reasons. First, the meaning of religious freedom is deeply dependent on contingent factors, such as constitutional history, the social outlook of the society, and the presence of religious minorities. Secondly, judicial actors at the supranational level are keen to show deference to national institutions when faced with complex issues

<sup>42</sup> I agree with Raz ('Human Rights Without Foundations') that a violation of human rights justifies international intervention of various types and not necessarily armed intervention.

regarding freedom of religion. Thirdly, any international actor will have to factor in a strong requirement of national sovereignty when deciding whether or not to intervene on the basis of the HRFR.

There is no easy way to understand the role of religion in other societies, and there is no steadfast definition of religion for that purpose. The way in which each state comes up with a cocktail of these different factors is a matter of its own national sovereignty that can hardly be interfered with without suspicion of new imperialism. The HRFR is not a strong concern in the system of international human rights, even if some would like to present it as such. It is just one human right amongst many others, and it must always be weighed against many other considerations.

It may be that the practice of human rights will come to resemble something altogether different one day. For the moment, it is not desirable to claim that human rights stand for a univocal set of moral demands at the international level. They are rights against national sovereignty; for this reason they have to be used with great caution, in order to avoid the worst suspicions of a new imperialism. This is particularly the case for the human right to freedom of religion, which is for the moment a limited right in the system of international human rights.
