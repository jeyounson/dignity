### Human dignity and commodification in bioethics

ALASTAIR V. CAMPBELL∗

#### **The meaning of human dignity**

This chapter is concerned with how the concept of human dignity relates to the current debates in biomedical ethics about the commodification of the human body and its parts. Before considering the specific topics dealt with in this discussion, I shall clarify how I am using the term 'human dignity'. In accordance with the approach of this volume as a whole, my use depends on the way in which the concept functions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948. It appears in the very first sentence of the Preamble to the Declaration:

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world . . .

As this wording makes clear, dignity is closely aligned to human rights, but also to the *human family* – not merely to the rights of individual members. This emphasis on human solidarity will be very important for my exposition of the issues in the current move towards the commodification of human bodily materials through what has been called the 'tissue economy' (Waldby and Mitchell 2006). In the decades since the UDHR was adopted, biomedical ethics developed dramatically in the United States and other Western nations; however, the debate rapidly seemed to place the sole focus on a notion of autonomy, narrowly understood as the individual's capacity of free choice. Such a narrow focus cannot be justified if we look at the detailed requirements of the UDHR, based on the core concepts of inherent dignity and *equal* and inalienable rights. Just a few of the specific requirements of the UDHR illustrate this:

- - Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.
- ∗ Much of the material in this chapter is derived from my book, *The Body in Bioethics* (Routledge-Cavendish, 2009), in which the issues are discussed in greater detail.
- - Article 25: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.
- - Article 29: Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.

As these clauses make plain, human dignity depends on freedom certainly, but that is just one of the elements which make up the moral requirements of a humane society. These include brotherhood (modern sensibility would use a gender-neutral term like 'solidarity'), welfare rights, rights to health and well-being and (notably) the acceptance of *duties to the community*, not merely private, individual rights claims on that community. It is from the perspective of this rich understanding of human dignity that I shall be arguing against the currently popular notion that there is no problem regarding the commodification of the human body and its parts. To treat one's body as merely a commodity, a possession which one can trade to personal advantage, I shall argue, undercuts the values of human welfare, human interdependence and one's responsibilities to the human community upon which human dignity depends.

#### **Biomedicine and the commodification of the human body**

I shall discuss two interrelated areas in this section: first, the trade in human tissue, consequent upon the increasing interest of biomedical researchers in both cell lines and potential therapies using stem cells; and, second, the trade in 'high value' body parts and tissue – notably blood and organs.

#### The tissue economy

The demand for human tissue from the medical and scientific community and from the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is now massive. Andrews and Nelkin sum up the situation in their study of the US market in human tissue, *Body Bazaar*:

The business of human bodies is a growing part of the \$17 billion biotechnology industry comprising more than thirteen hundred biotechnology firms. Those companies extract, analyze, and transform tissue into products with enormous potential for future economic gain. Their demands for skin, blood, placenta, gametes, biopsied tissue, and sources of genetic material are expanding. The blood we all provide routinely for diagnostic purposes is now useful for the study of biological processes and the genetic basis of disease. Infant foreskin can be used to create new tissue for artificial skin. Umbilical cords are valued as a source of stem cells . . . Cell lines derived from the kidneys of deceased babies are used to manufacture a common clot-busting drug . . . And human DNA can even be used to run computers, since the four chemicals – represented by the letters CATG – provide more permutations than the binary code. (Andrews and Nelkin 2001: 2f)

This treasure trove of human materials has spawned a new type of criminal – the bio-pirate. Michael Mastromarino, a former dentist who owned a New Jerseybased firm called Biomedical Tissue Services (BTS), was convicted in 2008 in a New York court for conspiring with funeral directors in several states to strip the body parts of corpses, awaiting burial or cremation, including arm and leg bones, skin and (possibly) heart valves and veins. The products were then sold on to companies providing materials for dental implants, bone implants, skin grafts and many other medical procedures. It emerged that more than one thousand corpses had been 'harvested' in this way. (Bones were replaced with PVC piping or broomsticks to conceal what had been done from the relatives.) More than 10,000 people received these tissues, some of them from persons infected with AIDS or other infectious diseases. Mastromarino was convicted and sentenced 18 to 54 years in prison. However, it is clear that he is not the first – and probably not the last – 'bio-pirate'. Andrews and Nelkin report several other earlier cases, including the sale of organs and brain parts from an infant by a morgue assistant, the sale of spines by the director of a medical school anatomy mortuary, and the routine sale of body parts, without the knowledge or consent of families, by mortuaries and crematoria in California (Andrews and Nelkin 2001: 160).

Clearly, such practices are utterly unethical, as well as probably illegal (although the laws under which people can be convicted are somewhat fuzzy and outmoded in many jurisdictions). But even if we discount these macabre fringes of the tissue market, what are we to make of the use of the huge amounts of quite legally obtained human tissue, held in numerous medical facilities and tissue banks throughout the world? (Estimates of the total amount are very hard to compute, but a calculation of tissue held only in the United States, published in 1999, suggested a total of at least 307 million specimens with an ongoing accumulation rate of more than 20 million samples per year. See Weir and Olick 2004: Chapter 2.) Does it matter that tissue donated freely and willingly for the purpose of improving medical research can now become a source of major profit for most parties involved, *except* the original donor? If there was consent (at least of some kind), and if no harm is caused to the original donors, why should we be concerned about it?

I shall return to this central question at the end of this chapter. First, however, we turn to even more obvious examples of the commodification of the human body: trade in blood and in transplantable organs.

#### High-value body parts

Blood and organs like hearts and kidneys are literally life-saving resources in medicine, yet both are in very short supply internationally. So far as blood is concerned, it is widely accepted that only a voluntary donation system can ensure a safe blood supply. However, less than 45 per cent of donated blood worldwide is collected in developing and transitional countries, yet these make up 80 per cent of the world's population (World Health Organization 2008). The goal of 100 per cent voluntary unpaid blood donations, set by World Health Organization in 1997, had been achieved by only 49 of the 124 countries surveyed in 2006. Many of these countries still rely heavily on family/replacement donors and paid donors, both known to be less safe sources than regular donations from unpaid donors. Moreover, in these poorer countries, the facilities for screening donors and blood may either be inadequate or absent altogether. Even when we look at a highly developed country like the United States, we find that, while *whole* blood donations are now entirely from unpaid sources, blood plasma donors are still paid. Thus, the question of the safety of these products becomes crucial, especially since they are widely exported to meet the needs of other countries.

The situation with transplantable organs is even worse. Since its development as a life-saving measure in the second half of the last century, organ transplantation has expanded exponentially in terms of survival rates, the number of people on the waiting list for the procedure, and the range of transplantable organs. Advances in immuno-suppression and in prevention of infection have led to improvement in both the survival of the recipients and of the transplanted organs. At the same time, there has been an increase in repeat transplantations (following failure of the graft) and in multiple organ transplants. The range of conditions for which transplantation is offered has widened, and transplantable organs now include kidney, liver (or sections of liver), pancreas, heart and lung. Brain-dead donors can provide all of these organs, while kidney and sections of the liver and pancreas can also be obtained from living donors. Survival outcomes are better from living (related or unrelated) donors than from cadaveric donors, and, in the case of kidney failure, better from transplantation than from dialysis.

A consequence of this dramatic expansion in life-saving potentiality has been a worldwide demand for organs from either living or cadaveric sources, far exceeding their current availability. In light of this, many bioethics authors have argued that we need to introduce a 'regulated market' in kidneys from living donors. In other words, they believe that these body parts should be regarded as commodities, to be traded (albeit with regulations to protect donors and recipients) on a worldwide market. (We do not find the same kinds of arguments in favour of a market in blood, presumably because the hazards to the recipients of a trade in blood are very evident.)

Are there plausible objections to the view that a regulated market makes organ trade morally acceptable, assuming for now that such regulation can prevent the exploitation evident in the current illegal market (a somewhat bold assumption!)? The basic argument against the sale of one's organs is that, although they are alienable (I can have them removed from my body and transferred to another), they ought not to be regarded as fungible or commensurable. That is: organs ought not to be dealt with as though they were commodities whose value can be determined in a market of demand and supply. To do so, it is argued, is to reduce one's body to a mere object amongst other objects, to fail to respect its special place as a part of my identity – my embodied self. Thus, in donating part of my body to help another, I make a personal investment in the other's welfare and survival; I give of myself to the other. But in treating my body merely as a means to income, I demean myself by using my body (parts) in an instrumental way.

However, some authors have argued that equating organ sales with lack of respect for personal identity is a conceptual confusion. For example, Wilkinson (2003) argues that (a) there is no necessary connection between commodification of bodies and commodification of persons (consider X who buys an organ from a friend Y who needs some money; X may commodify the organ but not the friend Y); and (b) empirically there is little reason to regard organ sale as worse than widely accepted practices such as the buying and selling of labour (consider manual labour workers in some countries paid at the lowest possible rates by companies outsourcing the manufacture of their brand name products). So if we are to prohibit organ sale, then we have to prohibit (at least some) of these widely accepted practices.

However, in response to this type of argument one may point out that examples of exploitation in some areas of social life do not provide a justification for the spread of such exploitation to other social interactions. Moreover, defenders of the marketability of organs do not provide any principles for preventing what we might call 'market creep' in the sale of body parts. On what basis do we draw a line in the authorization of the dismantling of the bodies of the poor to meet medical needs? Gill and Sade (2002) refer to this argument in relation to the possibility of heart transplants and point out (rightly) that the law could not authorize the killing of a person to provide a heart to another. There are simpler examples. There are many body parts without which a person can still function adequately, which are also transplantable and useful for those with medical or surgical needs. Examples would be people who seek replacement of a severed hand, an operation which has been carried out using a hand from a cadaver, but which would be more effective using the hand of a living person. So why should someone not offer their hand for sale? We need to ask why such sales should be prevented *in principle*. Where should we draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable trading in one's bodily resources?

#### **Conclusion: preserving our shared human dignity**

I return to the core concepts of the UDHR: freedom *and* equality; a common life where adequate social security and healthcare give everyone the chance of a life of dignity and self-development; rights, yes, but also duties; membership of the human family in which solidarity is a guiding principle. Relating such normative concepts to the question of the commodification of the body leads us naturally to the notion of the 'bio-commons'. The metaphor of a commons which must be protected from commercial interests has its ground in the history of 'enclosures'. When, in eighteenth-century Britain, common land, free to all for grazing, was taken over by powerful landowners, this resulted in massive suffering for the rural poor. So the metaphor of a 'bio-commons' promotes the idea that human materials and the information derived from them should be openly accessible so that they can be used for the benefit of all humankind, rather than for the benefit of the powerful (see Dickenson 2007: Chapter 8 and Waldby and Mitchell 2006: Chapter 5). By such a sharing for mutual benefit, the human origins of tissues, organs and blood would be properly recognized and the dignity of our common heritage respected and preserved.

I conclude that the notions of human dignity and solidarity, enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights – and in many other subsequent international declarations – require that the human body and its parts be treated, not as tradable assets, but as essential aspects of our shared, embodied humanity. Of course, every individual has a fundamental right to bodily integrity. Nothing in this account implies that the community in some sense 'owns' the bodies of its individual members (whether before or after death) or that it has claims on the use of such parts, against the will of the individual. Rather, our nature as embodied selves provides us for opportunities for altruism, the giving to 'unknown strangers' described in Titmuss' classic study, *The Gift Relationship* (Titmuss 1970). It is for these reasons that a full understanding of human dignity must lead us to oppose the idea of a market in body parts, condemn the involvement of some members of the medical profession in such activities, and require international commitment to effective ways of giving all persons access to the bio-commons.
