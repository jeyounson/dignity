### Human dignity in the Middle Ages (twelfth to fourteenth century)

RUEDI IMBACH

Any discourse on human dignity presupposes a specific anthropology. This is equally true for reflection on human dignity in the Middle Ages. The medieval efforts to interpret the human being occur in dialogue with two kinds of sources: on the one hand with biblical statements regarding the human being, and on the other hand with works from antiquity along with the Arabic and Jewish texts that discuss these works. Of interest in the first tradition is primarily the interpretation of the human being as the image of God, expressed most notably in Genesis 1:26 and Wisdom 2:23. At the core of the influence of ancient philosophy, in contrast, is the interpretation of the human being as *animal rationale* and as *animal sociale* and *politicum*. While the decisive texts of Aristotle in which this twofold designation of human beings is developed (the *Nicomachean Ethics* and *Politics*) only became fully accessible to the Latin world in the course of the thirteenth century, the notion of humans as rational beings had never sunk into oblivion.1 From ancient philosophy, Christian speculation had taken the problem of immortality, while the theme of beatitude and the final destination of humans in relation to eternal bliss and the sight of God was taken up and strongly enriched by theological reflection. This also holds for the development of the notion of a person, which was deepened in the light of the Trinitarian debate.2 What may not be overlooked is the propagation and redevelopment of ethics through the interaction not only with biblical guidelines, but especially through the questions of sin, grace, and the proper way to live one's life.

#### **Human dignity and the idea of humans as the image or likeness of God**

In the Middle Ages, the biblical doctrine of human beings as the image (*imago*) and likeness (*similitudo*) of God was, on the basis of patristic models, interpreted and developed in a number of very distinct ways. An important group of authors considers human beings' likeness to God to be grounded first and foremost in

their rational nature. Hugo of Saint Victor (*c*.1096–1141), for instance, argues that the human being is 'image according to reason (*ratio*), likeness in accordance with love' (*De sacramentis* I, 6, 2). In Anselm of Canterbury (1033–1109), this interpretation is closely connected to the idea of a proportionality between knowledge of oneself and knowledge of God: the better humans know themselves, the better they know God (*Monologion* c. 66). Even Augustine (354–430) had already repeatedly emphasized this relation, which manifests the dignity of human beings in a special sense – in a famous passage in the *Soliloquia*, he writes that if a person were to recognize himself, he would recognize God: 'noverim me, noverim te' (*Soliloquia* II, 1, 1). Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153), in contrast, is of the opinion that it is freedom that designates humans as the image of God (*De gratia et libero arbitrio* IX, 28). Human dignity exists in freedom: 'For the human being, I consider dignity (*dignitas*) free will, through which it is given to him not only to be superior to other creatures, but also to rule them.'3 Bonaventura (1217–74), finally, interprets the three activities of the human mind – remembering, cognizing and willing – in light of its being an image of God (*Itinerarium mentis in deum* III, 1). In Thomas Aquinas' (*c*.1224– 74) anthropology, the human likeness to God is the very goal of the creation of rational creatures; the rational nature of human beings allows them to imitate God through self-knowledge and self-love (*Summa theologiae* I, q. 93, Art. 4).4 Reason accounts for human dignity.5 The theologoumenon of humans as a likeness or image of God also explains the anthropocentrism of many medieval thinkers. When Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) writes that the human being stands in the middle of the structure of the world, she summarizes this special conception of the world order and emphasizes the dignity of the human person, 'because he is more powerful than any other creature'.6 As geocentrism and anthropocentrism expand, these are expressed in the theological–philosophical thesis that the world was created for the sake of human beings: 'In a certain way, the entirety of corporeal nature exists for the sake of the human being, insofar as he is a rational creature. Therefore, the consummation of the entire corporeal world to an extent depends on the consummation of the human being.'7 In light of Psalm 8 (verse 6), where it is said that God has placed everything under the humans' feet, it can be concluded that humans may use 'all kinds of things

to his advantage', even the 'end of celestial motion' is arranged around him.8 This arrangement of the entire creation around the human being attests to [is evidence of] the dignity of humans.9

#### **The priority of self-knowledge**

The Socratic tradition, which sees the essence of philosophical activity in the Delphic imperative of self-knowledge, is alive throughout the Middle Ages in a number of different ways (Courcelle 1974–5). Its presence is, again, particularly powerful in Bernard of Clairvaux, for instance when he tersely summarizes his intentions in a sermon: 'I wish, therefore, that the soul, before anything else, know itself.'10 From an epistemological perspective, the soul is the first object of knowledge in two different ways: it is that which is closest to us, and at the same time it is the most significant object of questioning. The primacy of self-knowledge must therefore be understood both chronologically and hierarchically. In a deservedly famous passage of*De consideratione*(a treatise addressed to the Pope), Bernard summarizes the decisive elements. As a question regarding what I am myself, self-knowledge includes the demarcation from what I am not, whether it rises above or lies below me. *Te*, *circa te*, *sub te* and *supra te* are the four stages of introspection that Bernard here indicates. Of particular importance in this context is the fact that the self is said to be the beginning and the end of reflection: 'For you, begin with reflecting on yourself, so that you will not uselessly concern yourself with others while neglecting yourself. What use it is for you to gain the entire world while losing yourself?'11

Other thinkers describe the process of self-examination in very similar ways. Richard of Saint Victor (*c*.1110–73), in contrast, calls on philosophers to concentrate on themselves in order to contemplate the nature and possibilities of human existence. However, he who dares to look inside himself will almost be infatuated with the depth and beauty of what shows itself to him, for he will discover a new world, and much that invokes admiration.12

- 9 *In symbolum apostolorum*, Art. 1, n. 886: 'Quinto ducimur ex hoc in cognitionem dignitatis humanae. Deus enim omnia facit propter hominem, sicut dicitur in Psal. VIII, 8: Omnia subiectisti sub pedibus eius.'
- 10 *Super cantica canticorum* 36, *Opera omnia*, vol. 1, p. 568.
- 11 *De consideratione* II, iii, 6, *Opera*, vol. 3, p. 414.
- 12 *Benjamin maior* III, c. 8, ed. Aris/Andres, 65: 'In hoc sane profundo invenies multa stupenda et admiratione digna, ibi invenire licet alium quendam orbem, latum quidem et amplum, et aliam quandam plenitudinem orbis terrarum. Ibi sua quaedam terra, suum habet caelum.'

It is entirely clear that the self-knowledge demanded by these authors is not conceived as an isolated or self-contained end, but embedded in a conception of the spiritual itinerary of human beings. In these texts, self-knowledge is one stage of a mystagogy. Even as many authors, most notably those of the twelfth century, agree on the priority of self-knowledge, there are nevertheless significant differences with respect to the fruits such self-knowledge is taken to bear for people themselves. While some authors, such as William of St Thierry (1080/85–1148) 13 and Hugo of Saint Victor consider capturing beauty and human dignity as an achievement, others, for instance Bernard or Helinand of Froidmont (*c*.1160–after 1226),14 emphasize that the person who studies himself becomes aware of his nullity and his misery. As Bernard summarized it incisively: 'We realise, that we are nothing.'15 In the context of their appropriation of the *cognosce te ipsum*, these twelfth-century authors plead – through their critique of a mode of philosophizing that was common at the time – for a way of philosophical questioning that would blossom again in the early Renaissance of the fourteenth century in Francesco Petrarca (1304–74). Petrarca is exemplary of the view that, a philosophy which, as a human practice, does not primarily realize contemplation of human life, does not fulfil its true task. This is impressively shown in the invective *De sui ipsius multorum ignorantia*, in which Petrarca argues for a mode of philosophy that gains a view of the ultimate possibility of human beings in thinking about itself (Imbach 2004a).

#### **The dignity of the person**

As indicated above, Trinitarian speculation in particular – which was concerned with capturing and describing the unity of the divine being and the trinity of the persons as clearly and precisely as possible – promoted reflection on the human being. Decisive for the development of the notion was first of all the definition proposed by Boethius (*c*.480–524), which connects the concept of nature with substantiality and individuality, and reserves the notion of 'person' for God, angels and humans: 'When therefore personhood is only in substances, in fact in rational ones, when every substance is nature and exists not in the universal, but in the individual, the definition of the person has been found: an individual substance of rational nature' (*naturae rationalis individua substantia*; *Contra Eutychen et Nestorium* III). However, two further definitions were of great importance. Richard of Saint Victor emphasizes the unique and

incommunicable nature of persons16 in describing them as 'incommunicable existence' of an intellectual nature (*incommunicabilis existentia*), and stressing the particular phenomenon of existing-for-oneself (*existens per se*). This is a quality that only ever applies to individuals – it does not describe a universal (*quid*), but is the answer to the question 'who?' (*quis*).17 Finally, Alexander of Hales (*c*.1185–1245) describes the person as a 'hypostasis distinguished by a property pertinent to dignity' (*hypostasis distincta proprietate ad dignitatem pertinente*).18 Alexander connects the notion of dignity with the concept of persons, who 'are moral beings, since they signify the quality of dignity'.19 According to Bonaventura, persons are not only characterized by singularity and incommunicability, but especially by the *supereminens dignitas* that is also discussed by Albertus Magnus (*c*.1200–80) when he describes persons as rational supposita that are 'characterized by natural and moral dignity'.20 Thomas Aquinas emphasizes the special mode of being of persons, which is identified as existing-through-itself and comprises individuality. This mode of being of rational substances, which is said to be the most dignified of all (*dignissimus*),21 implies self-governance (*dominiumsui*), that is, independence in acting (*Summa theologiae* I, q. 29, Art. 1), thinking and willing. Thomas does not hesitate to claim that the independent existence of rational substances – that is, personhood – is the most perfect being in the whole of nature.22 The dignity of human beings thus coincides with the dignity of personhood.

#### **In praise of freedom**

For a number of authors, freedom is the constitutive moment of human existence. Thomas Aquinas, for instance, opens the central ethical section of his *Summa* by discussing the free human being as the origin (principle) of his own deeds. According to Dante Alighieri (1265–1321), human freedom is the greatest gift of the divine goodness (*Paradiso* V, 19–24). Since human freedom

is the basis for responsibility and morality (see *Purgatorio* XVIII, 64–66), it functions more or less as the cornerstone of the entire *Divine Comedy*. The Church has often denounced determinist approaches, and theologians have defended freedom.23 In William of Ockham (*c*.1285 to *c*.1349), human freedom is significantly radicalized;24 a move that is initiated by John Duns Scotus (*c*.1265–1308).25 According to Ockham, freedom should not be understood in the first place as an absence of coercion, but as the capacity to act or refrain from acting. While, for Ockham, the specific human form of freedom cannot be proven, the freedom particular to human beings cannot be proven, it solely presents itself through experience.26 The radicalization of the notion of freedom in Ockham becomes clear when he claims that human beings have the capacity not to desire eternal bliss.27 This is an hypothesis that would be unthinkable for a Thomist, who would take the human desire for blessedness to be ontologically grounded. According to Ockham, the human will can reject any object, and thus even God. This doctrine of human and divine freedom yields important consequences not merely for ethics, but also for politics, since the primacy of freedom means that both acting morally and political authority presuppose the recognition of the freedom of others. On this basis, legitimate political authority can only be founded on mutual agreement.28

#### **Political dimensions**

The rediscovery of Aristotle's texts on practical philosophy fundamentally changed the basis for the consideration of human beings as social creatures. It introduced the possibility of conceiving the social order without recourse to theological theses. The human being as *animal politicum* constituted the central object of this line of research, whose foundations – in contrast to 'political Augustinianism' – no longer rest in the supernatural.29 In this way, dignity (re)emerges as a concept grounded in man's social nature. As such a political creature, human beings are after inner-worldly happiness, of the kind that appears exemplarily in Dante's *Monarchia* as a goal that is philosophically recognizable and that can be reached in a natural manner.30 In this horizon, being part of the *civitas* becomes a fundamental component of *humanitas*. Dante's contemporary, the Florentine Dominican Remigio dei Girolami, expressed this insight in an exceedingly pointed way by stating that whoever is not a citizen

is not a human being (*si non est civis, non est homo*, Dei Girolami 1985). But Thomas too highly valued the Aristotelian conception of the human as political creature. The linguistic ability clearly shows that humans are the most expressive animal.31 As the doctrine of natural law confirms, sociability is anchored in human nature. According to Thomas, the first ground rules of natural law can be identified by way of the inclinations (*inclinationes*) that move human beings. Humans share with all other living creatures their striving for self-preservation, and with animals reproduction and the rearing of offspring. Specifically human, in contrast, is the desire for knowledge and for life in a community.32 From these inclinations, we can not only determine the first ground rules of the unchangeable law of nature, this understanding of the dynamic human nature, on which the entirety of Thomist ethics and politics is grounded, also proves to be a further interpretation of Aristotle's double determination of human beings as rational and social animals. Thomas stresses the social nature of humans in a particularly memorable manner when, following Aristotle, he points out that every human is every other's friend: 'Every man is naturally every man's friend by a certain general love.'33

#### **The limits of the medieval conception of human dignity**

While it cannot be denied that medieval philosophers and theologians made essential contributions to our thinking about human dignity, and that much of what they have formulated on the matter has not lost any of its relevance and meaning, from a contemporary view there exist many problems with these conceptions of human dignity. First, their anthropological reflections had a strongly androcentric character. That is, their theories on human beings were almost exclusively developed from a male perspective. Certainly, the reasons for this can largely be found in the social structures of the time, but they are also closely connected with the relevant philosophical and theological sources. Misogyny was encouraged and theoretically supported not only by the thirteenth-century reactualization of the Aristotelian notion of the woman as a failed man, that is, as a creature that went awry due to reproductive infelicities (*mas occasionatus*; *De generatione animalium* II, 3; 737a27), but also by leading patristic theologoumena. But also two further features render these accounts of human dignity problematic from a contemporary view – that demands they are

<sup>31</sup> See the comments on this matter in the first chapter of the treatise *De regno* (Leonina XLII, p. 450a): 'magis igitur homo est communicatiuus alteri quam quodcumque aliud animal quod gregale uidetur.'

<sup>32</sup> *Summa theologiae*, I-II, q. 94, Art. 2; see Imbach 2004b.

<sup>33</sup> *Summa theologiae* II-II, q. 114 a. 1 ad 2: 'Dicendum quod omnis homo naturaliter omni homini est *amicus* quodam generali amore.' Also see *Summa contra gentiles* IV, c. 54, n. 6.

comprehensive and without reservation: the attempts to justify the death penalty and the legitimation of slavery. With regard to these two points, it should be kept in mind that the reception of Aristotle in the thirteenth century supported the idea of natural inequality amongst human beings. Given a hierarchical conception of reality, the questionability of slavery remains obscured: 'For those who lack in reason, yet are physically powerful, appear to be determined by nature to serve; this is how Aristotle puts it in his Politics.'34 While Thomas does not claim that slavery is grounded in natural law, he does believe that it can be deduced from natural law, and that it belongs to the law of peoples (*Summa theologiae* II-II, q. 57, Art. 3 ad 2).

With regard to the death penalty, I shall here only point out the influential position of Thomas Aquinas, who, on the basis of the thesis that the part is subordinate to the whole, argued as follows: 'If therefore a man, on account of a transgression, becomes a danger and corruptive influence to society, it is rational and beneficial to kill him in order to save the common good' (*Summa theologiae* II-II, q. 64, Art. 2). Someone who sins, the Dominicans moreover believe, falls from human dignity (*Summa theologiae* II-II, q. 64, Art. 2 ad 3). Still, this claim cannot be taken literally, but can only mean that this person does not act in accordance with the dignity of his nature.
