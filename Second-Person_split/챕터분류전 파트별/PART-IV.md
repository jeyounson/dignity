# PART IV

## 9. Morality and Autonomy in Kant

We have been concerned since Chapter 3 with the second-person standpoint's involvement in our moral conceptions and psychology. In this and the following two chapters, we turn to questions of more fundamental justification. What can vindicate these aspects of our moral thought? How can we account for the normativity that a law proclaiming equal dignity purports to have?

We owe the most compelling and systematic account of morality as respect for the equal dignity of persons to Kant. In this chapter, we consider Kant's own defense of the moral law's supreme authority, both his constructive argument in the *Groundwork* and the "fact of reason" in the *Critique of Practical Reason.* Each gives a central role to the distinctive freedom that Kant calls "autonomy"—"the property of the will by which it is a law to itself independently of any property of the objects of volition" (1996b: 440)—and to a claimed equivalence between morality and this freedom that Allison calls the "Reciprocity Thesis." As Allison formulates this Kantian doctrine, "freedom of the will is not only a necessary but also a sufficient condition of the moral law"(1986: 395). The moral law, and hence the dignity of persons, entails autonomy and vice versa. In the *Groundwork,* Kant puts this equivalence claim to constructive use, arguing that autonomy is a necessary presupposition of the deliberative standpoint and that we can infer the supremacy of the moral law from this independent premise. In the *Critique of Practical Reason,* Kant abandons this strategy and argues that the awareness of autonomy comes itself only through the recognition that we are bound by the moral law (the fact of reason).

In my view, both approaches fail to satisfy completely. The most we

can get from the fact of reason is not an account of, nor any warrant for, the purported authority of moral obligation, but only the reassurance that we do not need such an account since we are convinced of morality's authority already. That may be, but stilling skeptical worries is not the only purpose that such an account might serve. We might also reasonably wish for a better understanding of what Korsgaard (1996e) calls the "source" of the moral law's normativity. The constructive arguments of the *Groundwork* aim to provide such an understanding, but I shall argue that Kant's official argument in *Groundwork* 3, as well as arguments that philosophers have recently constructed from materials in *Groundwork* 1 and 2, all ultimately break down. (e.g., those of Korsgaard 1996b, 1996e, 1996f; Wood 1999). I believe they all fail for a common reason, namely, because they aim to derive the moral law from presuppositions of a (firstperson) deliberative standpoint alone.

As I see it, any such argument is bound to fail, since nothing in the bare project of acting for reasons, first-personally, commits a deliberating agent to autonomy as Kant defines it. I sketch this diagnosis in a preliminary way presently. First, however, we should note that even if Kant's argument were successful in these terms, it would still not fully capture, and therefore would not adequately vindicate, the distinctive normativity of moral obligations. The reason, as I have stressed in earlier chapters, is that moral obligation's purported normativity includes an irreducibly second-personal element. Moral obligations do not simply purport to provide supremely authoritative reasons. They are also what we are responsible for doing, what members of the moral community have the authority to demand that we do. And even if an argument of some other kind could show that moral obligations invariably provide overriding reasons, there is no way to establish accountability except within a second-personal framework. That is the lesson of Strawson's Point, or, as I have consistently put it: "Second-personal authority out, second-personal authority in." It follows, I believe, that the normativity of moral obligation cannot possibly be vindicated outside a second-person point of view.

Moreover, I believe that it is also impossible, outside the second-person standpoint, to establish that moral obligations are binding in the more familiar sense of providing supremely authoritative reasons.1 Kant's

<sup>1</sup> Alternatively, if it is held to be a conceptual thesis that moral obligations provide overriding reasons, I believe it is likewise impossible to establish that we actually have any moral obligations.

strategy in *Groundwork* 3 is to argue that autonomy is an inescapable presupposition of deliberation and then to derive the validity of the moral law from that assumption. I agree with Kant that autonomy of the will is a deepfeature of practical reason. But I disagree with his claim in *Groundwork* 3 that autonomy (as Kant understands it) must be presupposed in any intelligible (first-personal) deliberation. As I see it, autonomy and the dignity of persons, in the form of second-personal competence and second-personal authority, are presuppositions we are committed to from a second-person point of view.

The basic problem for Kant's argument in *Groundwork* 3 stems from the fact that as Kant defines autonomy of the will, it has no structural analogue in theoretical reason. This means that if Kant is to argue that autonomy is an inescapable presupposition of the practical standpoint, he must show how deliberation about what to do unavoidably presupposes a kind of freedom that other types of reasoning do not presuppose.2 But the only kinds of freedom that he plausibly identifies as inescapable presuppositions of practical reasoning in *Groundwork* 3 are ones that are common also to theoretical reasoning. As Kant there puts it, reason cannot "receive direction" from outside in making "judgments" in any area in which it is employed (1996b: 448).

If there were a theoretical analogue of autonomy of the will, there would have to be formal norms (like the Categorical Imperative) that ground reasons for belief that are no less substantive than moral reasons concerning the dignity of persons. Some norms of theoretical reasoning do apparently derive from the "form" of belief. For example, because belief necessarily aims at the true, beliefs are subject to formal norms of consistency and coherence. But these just rule out combinations of belief as incoherent or inconsistent; they do not rule in any beliefs in particular, even *pro tanto.*3 As Kant understands autonomy of the will, however, it has normative implications that go significantly beyond norms of practical coherence and consistency, like principles of instrumental reasoning and the formal theory of rational choice. If that were all it involved, autonomy could not entail the moral law.

Similarly, logical beliefs are also arguably grounded in the form of

<sup>2</sup> And that is not, moreover, simply the capacity to "set ends." Even if this also has no obvious analogue in, say, reasoning about what to believe, it is clearly not what Kant means by autonomy of the will.

<sup>3</sup> For discussion of this point, see Chapter 7.

belief. But these are significantly less substantive than the moral law also. To be sure, it is central to Kant's critical theoretical philosophy that a critique of pure reason can yield synthetic *a priori* truths such as the principle of universal causation. But if we look for practical analogues of theoretical principles like the causal principle, or inference to the best explanation, even these fall short of the CI except, perhaps in its truistic form: "Act only on universal laws (or on maxims that could be universal laws)." This is significantly weaker even than "Act only on maxims you could *will* to be universal law," not to mention the Formula of Humanity. What's more, a convincing argument for autonomy should not rest on controverted questions of Kant's transcendental idealism.

If Kant is to argue successfully that the practical standpoint unavoidably presupposes autonomy, then, he must show that it presupposes a kind of freedom that is unlike any we inescapably presuppose in theoretical reasoning. I argue that he fails and, moreover, that any such attempt must fail since, so far as the presuppositions of intelligible (first-personal) deliberation go, reasons for acting might all derive from the features of the objects of the will rather than from its form. To make this possibility vivid, I consider what practical reasoning would be like from a *naïve (first-person) practical standpoint.*

Suppose someone desires some state, *p.*4 In (intrinsically) desiring *p,* she sees *p* as (intrinsically) desirable; she takes features of *p* as warranting a desire that *p* and, *pro tanto,* as warranting actions that might bring *p* about (Bond 1983; Dancy 2000; Darwall 1983; Hampton 1998; Pettit and Smith 1990; Quinn 1991; Scanlon 1998: 41–55). From the practical point of view, desires are "backgrounded," as beliefs are from the theoretical (Pettit and Smith 1990). Suppose that *p* is relief of your pain. To someone who desires this, it will seem as if there are aspects of your being in pain and being relieved from it, respectively, that are reasons to desire your relief. And these reasons will also seem reasons to do *A,* if *A* will bring that about. In a case of this kind, reasons for doing *A* seem to come not from the form of the will but from "propert[ies] of the object of volition," since they apparently come from the object of desire (although not, again, as desired; like belief, desire is in the background).

A *naïve practical reasoner* deliberates about what to do from the per-

<sup>4</sup> As I noted in Chapter 7, it is consistent with *A*'s being instrumental in the relevant sense that *p* is the state of *A*'s being done.

spective of (critically revised) beliefs and desires. For such an agent, desires (and related mental states like pleasure and enjoyment) seem responsive to the value or desirability of outcomes or possible states of affairs. The agent reasons from premises drawn from the content of her beliefs and desires, not from anything about their form. Moreover, for such an agent, practical reasoning is structurally analogous to theoretical reasoning. When we reason from our beliefs, what we take as premises are putative facts about the world as they seem to us from the perspective of our beliefs. And when we reason from our desires (understood as involving evaluations of possible states of the world), our premises are putative facts about how it would be desirable for the world to be, as this seems from the perspective of our desires.5

I do not, of course, accept this naïve picture of the will. But the question remains: What rules it out? I argue that nothing in the conditions of intelligible first-personal deliberation does. In my view, it takes second-personal address to dispel the naïvete´. This is an aspect of Fichte's Point. It is what we come simultaneously to presuppose and discover about the nature of our agency from a second-person standpoint that excludes the heteronomy of naïve practical reasoning. The full implications of Fichte's Point are, first, that the second-person perspective invariably presupposes autonomy and the dignity of persons understood, respectively, as second-personal competence and second-personal authority (Chapter 10), and, second, that this standpoint reveals a fundamental difference in the kinds of freedom that theoretical and practical reason respectively involve (Chapter 11).

If the arguments of Chapters 10 and 11 can be made out, then, we will

<sup>5</sup> It takes some care to show that presuppositions of the practical standpoint do not rule this picture out. The biggest challenge is to show that nothing in the way reasongrounding norms of conduct must figure in practical conduct does so. It is an important insight of Kant's that agents act for normative reasons, as they see them, and that this involves the implicit acceptance of universal norms of conduct as applying necessarily to any rational agent. In Chapter 7, I argued that norm acceptance is state-of-a-subjectregarding rather than state-of-the-world-regarding. Moreover, it is an important, further consequence of the "wrong kind of reason" problem that norms of conduct differ conceptually from norms for desire. But although that is true, nothing in the terms of intelligible deliberation rules out the possibility that all reasons for action might nonetheless derive from reasons for desire, so that all reasons for action are instrumental. A second issue, again, concerns the necessity of rational norms and its relation to desire. I argue that a Moorean (consequentialist intuitionist) version can address this worry.

have a vindication of the normativity that the moral law purports to have. The burden of this chapter, however, is to show why arguments that remain within a first-person standpoint alone, like Kant's, are bound to fail.6 Only by being enriched second-personally can a more "sophisticated" first-personal deliberation arise within which the key Kantian concepts of autonomy and dignity can play the deliberative roles Kant gives them.7

### **The Need for a Vindication of Morality/Autonomy**

At a remarkable juncture in the *Groundwork,* at the end of section 2, Kant notes that it is consistent with his arguments to that point that morality might be nothing but a "figment of the mind" (2002: 445).8 He believes that he has already shown in sections 1 and 2 that morality is "grounded on . . . autonomy of the will" (1996b: 445). Morality's fundamental principle is, he has argued, the CI, and that holds only if the will can be subject to a law solely by virtue of its form and independently of any properties of its objects (its content or "matter"). Conversely, he has argued that autonomy implies the CI. By the end of section 2, then, the Reciprocity Thesis has been established.

But so far Kant's arguments have been entirely analytic. He has ana-

<sup>6</sup> I mean, of course, a "non-second-personal first-person standpoint." As I've noted before, second-person standpoints are always versions of first-person standpoints.

<sup>7</sup> Although it plays no obvious foundational role, we should note that there are many places in Kant's writings where the second-personal character of the moral law is implicit. I noted already in Chapter 6 passages in which Kant mentions second-personal aspects of dignity, respect, and self-conceit (Kant 1996d: 434–435, 462). In addition, Kant has remarkable discussions of conscience as replicating a judicial scene, with prosecutor and so forth (e.g., 1996a: 98–100; 1996d: 400–401, 437–440). More foundationally, Kant holds that "I can recognize that I am under obligation to others only insofar as I at the same time put myself under obligation" (1996d: 417–418). (I am indebted to Robert Johnson for reminding me of this passage.) And from the *Critique of Pure Reason:* "[E]veryone also regards the moral law as commands, which however they could not be if they did not connect appropriate consequences with their rule *a priori,* and thus carry with them promises and threat." (1998: A811–812, B839–840). (I am grateful to Jacob Ross for pointing me to this passage.) For example, as David Velleman has pointed out, Kant says in the Preface to the *Groundwork* that "the command 'thou shalt not lie' " holds for all rational beings (Kant 1996b: 389; Velleman 2005: 116–121).

<sup>8</sup> This is Allen Wood's translation of this passage, which seems superior to Mary Gregor's.

lyzed the "generally accepted" concept of morality and found it to involve autonomy of the will (1996b: 445). And conversely, he has argued that the very idea of a will bound only by its form entails the CI (402, 420– 421). All this shows, however, is that if there is such a thing as morality, then the will must have autonomy, and if there is such a thing as autonomy of the will, then the moral law (the CI) must be the will's law. It is thus consistent with the arguments in sections 1 and 2 of the *Groundwork* that the moral law, the dignity of persons, the CI, and autonomy of the will are all "chimerical idea[s]" (445). Neither autonomy nor morality follows from the Reciprocity Thesis. All that follows is that they stand or fall together.

Autonomy of the will and the CI both require "a possible synthetic use of practical reason," so neither can be established analytically. Both require a "critique" of practical reason of the sort that Kant embarks on in *Groundwork*'s section 3 (1996b: 445). Before we examine this, however, we should get some of the chief elements of Kant's action theory before us.

### **Kant's Action Theory**

"Desire," according to Kant, "is the faculty to be, by means of one's representations, the cause of the objects of these representations" (1996a: 9n; 1996e: 211). Desire and belief both involve representations of possible states of the world. Belief, we might say, is the "faculty" to be, by means of the world, the cause of one's representations' fitting the world. And desire is the faculty to be, by means of one's representations, the cause of the world's fitting one's representations.9

Not all behavior that results from beliefs and desires involves rational agency or the will. Indeed, by Kant's lights, not even all behavior that results from beliefs and desires in a "rationalizing," teleological way necessarily involves rational will.10 Kant defines the will as "the capacity to act in accordance with the representation of laws" or "principles." Willed action is invariably undertaken, therefore, on some (putatively) rational principle or norm; it must involve normative acceptance (1996b: 412).11

<sup>9</sup> On "direction of fit," see Anscombe 1957; Platts 1979; Smith 1994.

<sup>10</sup> See Donald Davidson's classic paper (1980).

<sup>11</sup> This doctrine should be interpreted in a way that allows for the possibility of weakness of will. One way of doing so is to take Kant to hold that nothing counts as a genuine action unless the agent does it for some reason, hence that she must see her action as recommended *pro tanto* by some rational norm. It is consistent with this that the agent nonetheless simultaneously believes (accepts) that her act is contrary to what she has most reason to do, all things considered, hence contrary to what valid rational norms would most recommend. On "normative acceptance," see Chapter 7.

By the same token, however, an act's resulting from a desire does not preclude it from being an instance of genuine agency nor, indeed, from involving pure practical reason (and, as Kant believes, autonomy). If the principle on which an agent acts is itself "precede[d]" by a desire that furnishes "the condition of its becoming a principle," then the principle is "empirical."12 It is unable to "furnish a practical law," and the will is heteronomous (1996a: 21, 33). Autonomy of the will, pure reason's being "of itself practical," is realized only if "reason can determine the faculty of desire as such" (1996e: 213).

Thus, Kant grants that all actions result from desire. What he denies is that all desires are "object-dependent;" some are "principle-dependent" (Rawls 2000: 150–151). Some desires arise not as apparent responses to represented possible states of the world or outcomes but because the agent accepts some norm or principle of action independently of the properties of any desired or desirable state.13 Autonomy is realized only when an activating desire is thoroughly principle- rather than objectdependent, that is, when the desire depends on a principle and that principle is not itself "empirical" (based on a prior desire) or derived from the value (e.g., the desirability) of an independent outcome or state.14 Autonomy thus depends on the possibility of an agent's accepting and acting on a normative principle that grounds substantive reasons for action independently of her regard for any object or state that might be an

<sup>12</sup> Kant here seems to ignore the possibility that normative reasons might not be conditional on desire, but still dependent on features of the object of desire, as these might be given in a Moorean intuition that some possible state of the world is intrinsically good, that is worthy of desire.

<sup>13</sup> For the interaction between this distinction and Nagel's distinction between motivated and unmotivated desires, see Chapter 7, note 2. Note also that autonomy requires not only that the will is governed by its own principles (laws), which apply to it independently of a desire for any state (i.e., are not "empirical" in the sense laid out in the last paragraph), but also that it is governed by norms that apply to it independently of the (apparent) value (e.g., desirability) of any outcome or state. On this point, see below.

<sup>14</sup> This condition is necessary, but not sufficient, for autonomy. There is one further condition, which is described in the paragraph after the next.

outcome of her action. Most obviously, the agent's acceptance of the principle must be independent of any desire for some state or outcome, even one as cognitively rich as sympathetic concern. Less obviously, but no less importantly, autonomy requires that the agent's acceptance of the principle be independent also of any putative evaluation of some outcome or state (like a Moorean intuition that a possible state is intrinsically good or "ought to exist for its own sake" [Moore 1993: 34]).

We can put this point by saying that the agent's valuing an outcome and even the outcome's having value, say, its being desirable, are reasons of the wrong kind to ground accepting a principle if that acceptance is to manifest autonomy. Or, equivalently, instrumental reasons are reasons of the wrong kind. "*Good* or *evil,*" Kant says, "always signifies a reference to the *will*" (1996a: 60). Autonomy requires reason-grounding norms of action "all the way down," that is, principles that are binding on the agent at the most fundamental level simply as a rational agent (among others), independently of the value of any possible state of the world. Only so can the will be "a law to itself independently of any property of the objects of volition" (1996b: 440).15

There is one other essential aspect of Kantian autonomy, which will occupy us more later, that can be appreciated by contrasting Kant's idea with rational intuitionism of the deontological sort held by Richard Price (1974) and W. D. Ross (1930).16 Deontological intuitionists differ from consequentialist intuitionists like Moore in holding that there are fundamental norms of action that do not derive from the value of outcomes. Consider, for example, a Rossian who holds that there is a *pro tanto* moral duty to keeppromises that is self-evident *a priori.* Can the acceptance of this principle after a deontological intuitionist fashion manifest Kantian autonomy? I think the answer has to be "no." To be sure, such an acceptance is not based on features of any object of the agent's desire or on the independent desirability of any possible state of the world. So any desire an agent acts on because she accepts this principle as self-evident *a priori* will be principle-dependent rather than object-dependent. But

<sup>15</sup> It is important to see that autonomy, as Kant defines it, has both a normative and a metaphysical component. The normative component is the claim that there are valid (reason-grounding) norms that apply to the rational will as such, independently of any property of the objects of volition. And the nonnormative, metaphysical component is that the will can act on this law.

<sup>16</sup> Rawls 1980 and Korsgaard 1996e are helpful here.

her acceptance of the principle will nonetheless be based on "propert[ies] of the objec[t] of [her] volition," independently of anything about the form of the will (Kant 1996b: 440). She accepts the principle because (as she believes) promise-keeping is (self-evidently) intrinsically right *(pro tanto).* She doesn't accept the principle of keeping promises because it follows from some formal principle of the will like the CI. Her acceptance derives rather from intrinsic features of promise-keeping and the property of rightness that she takes to supervene upon these.

Having noted this deontological intuitionist form of heteronomy, I want to set it aside. We return to it later when we consider Kant's account of the "fact of reason." If Kant is to vindicate autonomy as non-illusory within a critique of practical reason, he must argue that the practical standpoint rules out broadly intuitionist views of both consequentialist and deontological varieties. To show that Kant's own attempted vindication fails, therefore, it will be enough to show that it does not rule out the consequentialist variety, and this is what I focus on.

A few final clarificatory remarks. First, I should stress again that I am not defending the consequentialist picture. I am arguing that the materials that Kant brings to bear in *Groundwork* 3 do not rule it out and that it takes the second-person standpoint to do so. So, second, although I agree that autonomy is a deepfeature of practical reason, I deny that it can be established in the way Kant tries in *Groundwork* 3. And third, I agree with Kant that autonomy is a presupposition of moral obligation and the dignity of persons. But again, I do so because I think these ideas have an irreducibly second-personal element that presupposes autonomy.

### **Vindicating Morality/Autonomy in** *Groundwork* **3**

Kant begins section 3 with interrelated definitions of will and freedom: "*Will* is a kind of causality of living beings insofar as they are rational," and freedom is "that property of such causality that it can be efficient independently of alien causes *determining* it" (1996b: 446). Kant points out that this defines freedom only negatively, so it must be inadequate. A random "choice"-generating device might operate independently of external causes, but it would not be a free will. The will is, or includes, practical reason, so it must involve guidance by "practical laws" ("laws of freedom"), that is, by valid norms of practical reason (448).17 There-

<sup>17</sup> Of course, Kant cannot simply assume that norms of practical reason involve autonomy (and so are "laws of freedom" in that sense), without begging the question.

fore, although freedom is "not a property of the will in accordance with natural laws," it "is not for that reason lawless but must instead be a causality in accordance with immutable laws of a special kind" (446). An adequate definition of the will must therefore include both a negative and a positive concept of freedom. A will determines itself independently of alien causes (negative freedom) and in accordance with rational norms (positive freedom).

Kant realizes that it doesn't follow from these reflections that we actually are free, in either a negative or a positive sense. What we have so far is actually just another reciprocity thesis, this time between the will, on the one hand, and negative and positive freedom, on the other. If the will exists, then so do negative and positive freedom, and vice versa. It is consistent with that being the case, however, that the will and negative and positive freedom are all "chimerical ideas."

What gets us inside this circle of concepts, according to *Groundwork* 3, is the idea of an inescapable presupposition of the deliberative standpoint:

I say now: every being that cannot act otherwise than *under the idea of freedom* is just because of that really free in a practical respect, that is, all laws that are inseparably bound up with freedom hold for him just as if his will had been validly pronounced free also in itself and in theoretical philosophy. (1996b: 448)

Kant's strategy is as follows. We assume the Reciprocity Thesis as already established, hence that autonomy entails the bindingness of the moral law. And then we attempt to show that any deliberating agent must presuppose autonomy. It will then follow from the Reciprocity Thesis that any deliberating agent must also presuppose that she is bound by the moral law. And, if that is so, then, for practical purposes, she *is* bound by the moral law. The possibility that she might not be bound by it, or that she is bound by some conflicting alternative practical law (say, one that counsels her to produce more valuable states of affairs even when this conflicts with the moral law) is something she must reject as a condition of the intelligibility of her own deliberation.

This would be an excellent strategy, if it could be pulled off. It is, indeed, difficult to see how a norm that a deliberating agent is bound to accept as a condition of the intelligibility of her own deliberation could fail to apply to her validly. And it may seem an initially promising strategy also. It seems quite plausible that presuppositions of negative and positive freedom in at least some of the senses that Kant mentions are indeed necessary for deliberation to be intelligible.

Take negative freedom, for example. To be negatively free, I must be able to deliberate about what to do and to act on my deliberations "independently of alien causes determining" me. Whether I am negatively free in this sense, I cannot, of course, say. But if we interpret "alien causes" as causes that might interfere with my reasoning, it certainly seems that I must deliberate under the assumption that I am. Serious practical deliberation just is the attempt to work out what there are reasons to do for the purpose of acting on them. To count as deliberating at all, I must proceed under the assumption that my thinking rationally, or acting on practical reasons, is not precluded by "alien causes" in this sense.18

The situation is identical with positive freedom, understood as the internal capacity to deliberate in accordance with and to act on rational norms. Here again, for me sensibly to deliberate about what to do, I must presuppose that I can do so in accord with rational norms and act on the upshot of my deliberation. To understand myself as deliberating at all, I must proceed on the assumption that I can think about what to do rationally.

Now so far, it is important to see that the relevant presuppositions of negative and positive freedom are in no way unique to or distinctive of practical reasoning. Whether one is deliberating about what to believe, what to feel, or what to do, one must assume that one can think free of alien causes and in accordance with rational norms. And Kant says as much: "One cannot possibly think of a reason that would consciously receive direction from any other quarter with respect to its judgments, since the subject would then attribute the determination of his judgment not to his reason but to an impulse" (1996b: 448). This is true of reason in all its employments. Whenever we make normative judgments concerning what there is reason to believe, feel, or do, we must presuppose negative and positive freedom in the sense that our judgments are free of alien causes and in accordance with rational norms.

So far, so good. However, Kant also claims that the positive freedom

<sup>18</sup> The emphasis here must be on "alien" causes. I can't see that the argument, at this point anyway, requires the presupposition that one's rational thinking is not itself a causal process. I set aside the question of whether Kant believed that a deliberating agent must assume incompatibilist freedom as irrelevant to our concerns.

he has identified is the same thing as autonomy of the will. "What, then, can freedom of the will be other than autonomy, that is, the will's property of being a law to itself?" (1996b: 447). But why should we suppose that? The only sense in which Kant has vindicated a presupposition of positive freedom is one that is common to both practical and to theoretical reason. And, as we have seen, autonomy of the will has no structural analogue in theoretical reasoning. So the kinds of freedom that theoretical and practical reasoning presuppose in common cannot entail autonomy.

Perhaps, however, there is something about the practical standpoint in particular that requires a deliberating agent to presuppose autonomy. Consider, then, how deliberation might proceed from a naïve (firstperson) practical perspective. The primitive deliberative phenomenon is taking some fact about the world as a reason to do something. Wondering how to spend a free evening, I scan the newspaper to find an attractive possibility, say, going to watch a film. What I take as reasons for desiring to go, and for actually going, are aspects of the possible state of seeing the film on whose basis I might want to see it, or, if I cannot articulate these, the fact that, as it might seem to me, seeing the film would be good or desirable, a possible state or outcome that there is some reason to bring about.19 Evidently enough, then, if I decide to go for that or these reasons, my reasons for going will derive from properties of the object of my desire (and so my volition); it will depend on good-making features of the possible state of the world that would be the outcome of my action as these seem from my perspective. Equally evident, I have not had to suppose that these reasons come from the form of the will.

But do we yet have genuine agency and a will? For Kant, rational action involves not just beliefs and desires, but also some norm or principle the agent accepts and implicitly make her own in acting on it (1996b: 412; 1999: 23–24). For intelligent pursuit of an outcome I desire to involve my will, I must deliberate on the basis of some rational norm, one I take to apply validly to any possible rational agent. And I must presuppose that I am bound by such norms as a condition of the intelligibility of my own deliberation. But does this require me to presuppose autonomy? For

<sup>19</sup> Of course, these might include facts about myself, my expected mood, how I would expect to enjoy the film, and so on, that I take as reasons for going, and for wanting to go. But these are still facts about the objects of my desire most properly understood, not the fact of my desire itself.

this assumption to amount to autonomy, I would have to be required by the logic of my deliberative situation to presuppose that (at least some) reason-generating norms are valid independently of any properties of the objects that I am counseled by them to bring about. What in the deliberative context forces me to assume this?

Consider what norm I might accept in deciding to go to the film because I expect the state of seeing it to be good (for whatever goodmaking reasons my consideration of the state presents me with). The state of my seeing the film will seem to me to be an intrinsically good thing,20 a state that, in Moore's words, ought to exist for its own sake.21 So a natural answer to the question what norm I might accept is Moore's answer. I might accept the act-consequentialist norm of always doing whatever promotes good or desirable states or outcomes, and think, in accepting that, that any rational agent should do likewise.

Now I am not saying, I should make clear, that anything in the deliberative context would force the acceptance of this norm. I am just saying that nothing seems to preclude it and that accepting it would seem quite natural from a naïve practical standpoint. Just as belief aims at accurate representation of the world as it actually is, so from the naïve practical standpoint of an agent with desires might action seem to be for bringing about intrinsically desirable states or outcomes, as these seem from the perspective of her desires.22

<sup>20</sup> Compare Kant's remark in *Reflexionen* 6660: "The expression 'it is good' expresses a relation to desire as the expression 'it is true' a relation to belief" (Kant 1900– ). I am indebted here to Timothy Rosenkoetter, "A Semantic Approach to Kant's Practical Philosophy," presented at the APA Central Division 2003 meetings in Cleveland, Ohio. The translation of the above passage is Rosenkoetter's.

<sup>21</sup> On reflection, the idea that a state simply ought to be cannot be made fully coherent. I develop this point at greater length in Darwall 2003b. I argue that Moore's conception should be rejected, mainly because it is inconsistent with the autonomy of the will we can appreciate from the second-person standpoint. For a sympathetic discussion of the idea that deliberation from the practical standpoint is best interpreted in Moorean terms, see Regan 2003a.

<sup>22</sup> Compare also Kant: "Theoretical knowledge may be defined as knowledge of what *is,* practical knowledge as the representation of what *ought to be*" (Kant 1998: A633). This is Moore's approach in *Principia Ethica,* although he doesn't identify judgments of what states have intrinsic value ("ought to exist for what for its own sake") with desires for those states. Moore does, however, draw the consequence that action on such a view is essentially instrumental and that normative reasons for action derive entirely from the intrinsic value of states.

This was Moore's view in *Principia.* Indeed, he there held that there is only one fundamental ethical concept, the notion of intrinsic value or of something's being such as "ought to exist for its own sake." And he concluded that the concept of an action's being right (or what one ought) to do is conceptually reducible to that of intrinsic value and empirical causal concepts: "To assert that a certain line of conduct is, at a given time, absolutely right or obligatory is obviously to assert that more good or less evil will exist in the world, if it be adopted than if anything else be done instead" (Moore 1993: §17, 77).

Now Moore's (conceptual) definitional claim is surely a mistake, as his famous open question argument can be employed to show. Anyone who, knowing that one course of action will produce the best states, asks whether there might nonetheless be better reason to do something else (say, not to repay a loan to a seditious bigot), clearly asks an open question.23 And someone who asserts that there is an overriding reason to repay the loan, even at the cost of producing less desirable states, clearly does not contradict himself. So the concept of there being reason to do something is distinct from the concept of the action's being one that will bring about the most desirable feasible states. Even so, someone might quite coherently and, from a naïve deliberative standpoint, quite naturally, think that although these are distinct concepts, considerations of the desirability of outcomes provide the only reasons for action. She might accept the Moorean doctrine not as a definition of right or ought to do but as a fundamental normative principle.24

Practical reasoning on the consequentialist principle is in an important sense formally analogous to theoretical reasoning about what to believe. It can be factored into two parts, along the lines of Moore's definition. One part is theoretical reasoning pure and simple, working out everything one can do and the long-term consequences, that is, determining for every feasible act, how the world would be if it were done.25 The other is ethical, evaluating all possible states of affairs to determine which "ought to exist" and to what degree. But although the thought that a possible state is good or ought to exist differs, of course, from the thought

<sup>23</sup> So long, that is, as we evaluate states independently of their relation to valid norms of action.

<sup>24</sup> As, indeed, Moore later did (1966).

<sup>25</sup> Obviously, I am abstracting from epistemological issues. I assume this model can be modified to take account of probabilistic information, uncertainty, and so on.

that a state actually exists in fact, it has the same structure. Both are stateof-the-world-regarding. We can think of thoughts of the former kind as given in desire and thoughts of the latter kind as given in belief. Naïve deliberation under the influence of desire and belief, regimented with the Moorean principle, then becomes the determination of which available action would bring about the most valuable states, with this being determined under the influence of the agent's (critically informed) beliefs and desires.

But do we have an agent even yet? Obviously, a creature who deliberates about what to do simply from the perspective of her current desires and beliefs, and who is incapable of stepping back and critically revising these, is not an agent in any sense we should be interested in here. A deliberating agent must, as Korsgaard says, both be, and be able see herself as, "something over and above" her desires who "chooses which desire to act on" (1996e: 100). But it is quite possible for a naïve agent to do that without assuming Kantian autonomy of the will. Although she will, of course, have to assume autonomy in the familiar sense of being able to act on critically revised desires and so to make her actions "her own" (e.g., Dworkin 1988). As we have been thinking of it, the naïve agent's desires are identified with her current evaluations of the value of the possible states of the world that are their objects. She can certainly step back from these and reevaluate, getting a better conception of the features of these states on which she takes their value to supervene and, hence, of their value.

Just as a theoretical reasoner can bring experience and reflection to bear on the dispositions to belief involved in her current experiences, for example, overriding or defeating any tendency to believe that an apparently bent stick in water before her really is bent, so also can a naïve practical reasoner analogously critically revise her desires. A naïve deliberating jogger encountering a charging dog, for example, might draw on past experience and reflection to override a strong tendency of fight or flight and form a desire to continue at his leisurely pace while keeping his hands relaxed with palms down and feigning indifference.

Plainly, this picture of deliberation is still much too naïve. For one thing, although an implicitly realist epistemology can seem quite plausible for theoretical reasoning, it can be difficult to see how to understand the intrinsic desirability of states metaphysically and how to guarantee the right kind of epistemic relation between desires (or intuitive evaluations of desirability) and the intrinsic value of states so understood. For another, this picture assumes that rational deliberation is in its nature instrumental, and we have no good reason to believe that. But my point in providing this consequentialist sketch is not to defend it, but to suggest that it bears at least some resemblance to the way things seem from a naïve deliberative standpoint and to ask what in the presuppositions of any intelligible practical reasoning rules this picture out. So far as I can see, nothing does. Deliberation on this basis is surely intelligible, even if it is mistaken.

Thus, although intelligible deliberation must presuppose positive freedom of some form, it need not presuppose autonomy of the will. If it is sufficiently naïve, it can coherently proceed by assuming a kind of positive freedom that is formally analogous, in the sense I've illustrated, to what we must presuppose in theoretical reasoning. A naïve practical reasoner may intelligibly assume that her reasoning is guided by norms that derive ultimately from the nature and value of its objects (the world as it ought to be), just as a theoretical reasoner must assume that his reasoning is guided by norms that depend on its relation to its objects (the world as it actually is). It follows that Kant's argument for autonomy in *Groundwork* 3 fails.

### **Other Arguments in the** *Groundwork*

Perhaps, however, other arguments in the *Groundwork* can vindicate autonomy and the moral law. One that has been much discussed recently is Kant's "derivation" of the second formulation of the CI, the Formula of Humanity (FH): "So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means" (1996b: 430; see especially Korsgaard 1996f and Wood 1999: 124–132). Although Kant himself explicitly notes that the argument for FH in section 2 depends on assumptions that he will only later attempt to prove in section 3 (in the argument just canvassed) (1996b: 429n), it is sometimes put forward as a freestanding argument.

Christine Korsgaard and Allen Wood present Kant's argument for FH as a "regress of conditions."26 The argument takes two somewhat different

<sup>26</sup> Korsgaard gives a streamlined version of her interpretation of Kant's argument for FH in Korsgaard 1996e: 122.

forms. One proceeds from a premise about the kind of valuation of ends in general that any practical reasoning necessarily involves (the "value of ends" argument). And a second proceeds from the kind of value that any deliberating agent must attribute specifically to her own rational agency (the "value of agency" argument).

The "value of ends" argument begins with the premise that when an agent acts for a reason, she must act for some end that she regards as objectively valuable (Korsgaard 1996e: 122; Wood 1999: 129). It then claims that an end can have objective value only if something is the source of its value (or, as it is also sometimes put, if the "conditions" of its having objective value are realized).27 In one way this claim is uncontroversial. If there are conditions on some end's being valuable, and if whether there is reason to do something depends on the value of that end, then in acting for that reason, the agent must presuppose that the relevant conditions hold.

The argument then shifts to what an agent must presuppose to be the condition or source of the value of her ends and what follows from this. Korsgaard puts Kant's argument as follows.

He asked what it is that makes these objects good, and, rejecting one form of realism, he decided that the goodness was not in the objects themselves.... Kant saw that we take things to be important because they are important to us—and he concluded that we must therefore take ourselves to be important. (1996e: 122)

Wood puts a similar formulation by saying that "we can regard this goodness [i.e., the objective goodness that we must see our ends as having] as originating only in the fact that we have set [the] en[d] according to reason... Rational choice of ends is the act through which *objective* goodness enters the world." Wood concludes on Kant's behalf that "the source of all such value is nothing but the value of rational willing itself, which can confer objective value on other things only if it is presupposed that it has objective value" (1999: 129–130).

Now in one sense it is uncontroversial that an end an agent sets for herself has objective value only if choosing the end accords with reason. Consequentialist realists like Moore can agree, since they will take it that

<sup>27</sup> Korsgaard favors the latter formulation in 1996f (originally published in 1983) and the former in more recent formulations, for example, 1996e.

a valuing fails to accord with reason when it fails to accord with facts about the value of possible states of the world that provide reasons for choice.28 What they are bound to reject is that laws of practical reason are formal (have their source in the form of the will) and hence that the desirability of outcomes and the choiceworthiness of actions depends on whether they can be desired or willed in accordance with such formal laws. What they assert is heteronomy: the laws of practical reason are given by the independent value of outcomes or possible states of the world, to which desires and evaluations of states apparently respond.

It is clear, however, from Korsgaard's opposing the premise to a form of realism that Kant meant to reject ("substantive realism" of the sort Moore is generally thought to represent), that the premise of her argument already rules out heteronomy, and so simply assumes autonomy of the will.29 But if, as Kant believes, nothing can warrant that assumption other than a critique of practical reason of the sort he undertakes in *Groundwork* 3, then, so far as the materials of the *Groundwork* go, the resulting argument for FH must ultimately depend on the argument for autonomy in *Groundwork* 3, which we have already found wanting.

Again, I should stress that I can agree with the premise of the Korsgaard/Wood argument for FH. My point is that we don't have an argument for it in the materials provided either by *Groundwork* 3 or by contemporary attempts to buttress these. I believe that it takes materials provided by the second-person standpoint to establish all three of the following: the dignity of persons, the CI, and autonomy.30

It follows that without an argument for autonomy already on hand, the "value of ends" argument cannot establish FH. What, then, about the "value of agency" argument? This version finds better support within Kant's own text.

<sup>28</sup> See also Parfit 1997.
<sup>29</sup> "Substantive realism" is Korsgaard's term in Korsgaard 1996e.

<sup>30</sup> Actually, even if we were to assume the first premise in the sense that entails autonomy, that is. that a condition or source of value is being willed rationally (in accord with formal laws), it is very unclear how anything like FH would follow as a conclusion. The basic problem, as various commentators have pointed out, is that it is not obvious why a condition or source of value must itself have value in order for anything else to derive value from it. Samuel Kerstein (2001) points out that there would be no less reason to say that rational agency is the source of disvalue (if, that is, something's being objectively bad is thought to depend on its being rationally rejected as an end), but no one would think to conclude that rational agency is therefore disvaluable.

The human being necessarily represents his own existence [as a rational agent] in this way [as an end in itself]; so far it is thus a *subjective* principle of human actions. But every other rational being also represents his existence in this way consequent on just the same rational ground that also holds for me; thus it is at the same time an *objective* principle from which, as a supreme practical ground, it must be possible to derive all laws of the will. (Kant 1996b: 429)

This passage directly precedes Kant's statement of FH, so it can reasonably be interpreted as intended to support it.

Now there are uncontroversial senses in which a deliberating agent must treat her own rational agency as an end in itself. For purposes of her deliberation, she has no rational alternative but to value thinking and acting rationally, at least implicitly. If this has no value, then she should be doing something else rather than deliberating. And she must also assume the value of reasoning well. Deliberation is something one can do at all only by trying to do it properly. In these senses, a presupposition of the value of rational practical thinking is simply built into deliberation. Moreover, serious deliberation, by its very nature, attempts not just to answer, as it were, the advisor's question: "What is the best advice to give myself about what to do?" It attempts also to direct the will rationally. In all these senses, a presupposition of the value of rational agency is simply part of serious deliberation.

But that seems to be as far as the presuppositions that are necessary for first-personal reasoning go.31 I could quite intelligibly deliberate under the assumption that, although my rational thought has great value now, it might not some time from now (a reason for me to deliberate now rather than then).32 It is not obvious, of course, how I could possibly

<sup>31</sup> For an excellent discussion of this argument to which I am indebted, see Regan 2003b. David Sussman (2003) argues that Regan's arguments don't work as criticisms of Kant, although they might as criticisms of Wood's and Korsgaard's interpretation of the regress argument. Sussman argues, plausibly, that Regan, Wood, and Korsgaard all conflate objective value with practical necessity, and that Kant's arguments depend on the way in which, when a rational agent commits herself to an end, she is then under a practical necessity to take the necessary means. As he points out, this follows a line that Korsgaard herself pursues in Korsgaard 1997. I criticize this line in Darwall 2001. One problem is that, so far as instrumental reason is concerned, the agent is under a rational necessity only to take the necessary means or to give upthe end. So instrumental reason is insufficient, by itself, to provide a source of reasons for acting.

<sup>32</sup> The relevant value might be at least partly instrumental.

justify such an assumption. But there is nothing incoherent in it, and the assumption would be perfectly compatible with intelligible deliberation. And I could certainly think that the value of my thinking and acting rationally in the future is overridden by other values if, for example, I were given a Hobson's choice in which I could continue as a wellfunctioning rational agent only at the cost, say, of my children's lives.

Moreover, in none of these senses, it is important to see, does valuing my own rational agency (now) commit me to valuing others'. For example, when I deliberate, I authorize my own rational thought and agency, in the sense of presupposing that I am (now anyway) competent to judge reasons and to act on them.33 But nothing in that authorization commits me either to thinking it present in others, or even to thinking that it will continue through time in me. I am, of course, bound to recognize that others are committed to their own rational authority insofar as they deliberate, but that doesn't mean that I must authorize them, or even that they are committed to authorizing themselves in the future. I might think that I or they, or that both of us, are simply not to be trusted as practical reasoners in the future. Neither is it the case that to deliberate intelligibly now, I must think that I have reason to promote or respect their, or even my own future, rational agency. Again, I am not saying for a moment that there is any justification for thinking any of these things. I am just saying that they seem not to be ruled out by any norms that are constitutive of the very activity of rational deliberation. Someone would certainly still count as deliberating if she accepted them, though she wouldn't, for example, if she didn't seek normative reasons for acting or assume that she can think rationally for purposes of her own current deliberation.

These possibilities can all be made vivid by considering the Moorean picture that I have been suggesting is the natural way of seeing things from a naïve first-person deliberative standpoint. From this perspective, rational authority is fundamentally epistemic; anyone's title, one's own or anyone else's, ultimately depends on how reliably his or her thinking reflects an independent order of facts about the world and the intrinsic value of possible outcomes. So viewed, rational authority can be defeated or earned just as epistemic authority is in theoretical reasoning. Clearly

<sup>33</sup> Wood makes an argument that is relevant here. See Wood 1999: 130. The kind of authority under discussion here differs from other forms of valuing in play in the preceding paragraphs.

enough, taking one's own powers of inquiry to warrant trust in the present moment does not commit one now to trusting one's past or future judgment or to trusting now the judgment of any other would-be inquirer. Engaging another in a serious conversation about what to believe does implicitly grant epistemic authority to the other, as we saw in Chapter 3. But first-personal theoretical reasoning need not grant such authority, and neither must first-personal practical reasoning if it takes a naïvely consequentialist, Moorean form.

It is significant, therefore, that when Kant says that every "rational being also represents his existence on just the same rational ground that holds for me," he remarks in a footnote that he "here put[s] forward this proposition as a postulate" and that "the grounds for it will be found in the last Section" (1996b: 429n). This shows a recognition on Kant's part that in order for a rational agent's claim of the value of his own rational nature to entail the Formula of Humanity, it must itself be grounded in autonomy of the will. But if that is so, any such claim that does not already presuppose autonomy will be insufficiently strong to entail the moral law, and, as we have already seen, Kant doesn't think that anything he has said in sections 1 and 2 proves autonomy. He believes that the arguments he provides before section 3 are consistent with the moral law and autonomy of the will both being chimerical ideas.34 Consequently,

<sup>34</sup> In Korsgaard 1996e, Korsgaard puts forward a different argument for the Formula of Humanity that is rooted in the self-reflective character of the deliberative standpoint. Korsgaard notes that agency requires some degree of self-reflection, that the agent must see himself as "something over and above all [his] desires" who "*chooses* which desire to act on" (100). This commits the agent to a "practical identity," a normative conception of himself, which he draws on in deliberation. She argues that there is one practical identity I cannot question as a deliberating rational agent, namely, my identity as a deliberating rational agent. I am committed from within the deliberative standpoint to my "identity simply as *a human being,* a reflective animal who needs reasons to act and to live" (121). This means, she argues, that I must treat my own humanity or rational agency as somehow a source of normative reasons for me. To vindicate the bindingness of the moral law, however, we need to be able to conclude that I am committed to treating rational agency in others as normative for me also. Korsgaard's argument from here is complex, drawing primarily on Wittgensteinian themes about the impossibility of a private language (131– 136). The basic idea is that the claim that rational nature is a source of *agent-relative* reasons—that is, that the agent's rational nature gives reasons distinctively to him—treats these reasons as the kind of essentially private phenomenon that Ludwig Wittgenstein showed to be incoherent. The moral of the private language argument for practical philosophy, Korsgaard argues, is that all reasons must be "public and shareable" (136). Conthe *Groundwork*'s case for the vindication of dignity and the moral law ultimately hangs on the argument of *Groundwork* 3, and, as we have seen, that argument does not work.

### **The Fact of Reason**

By the time he wrote the *Critique of Practical Reason,* Kant had apparently given upon the strategy of *Groundwork* 3. In the second *Critique,* he holds that there is no access to the concept of freedom except through that of the moral law:

[W]hereas freedom is indeed the *ratio essendi* of the moral law, the moral law is the *ratio cognoscendi* of freedom. For, had not the moral law *already* been distinctly thought in our reason, we should never consider ourselves justified in *assuming* such a thing as freedom (even though it is not self-contradictory). But were there no freedom, the moral law would *not be encountered* at all in ourselves. (Kant 1996a: 4n)

Were the deliberative standpoint not to involve an "encounter" with the moral law, it would require no presupposition of autonomy. When, however, we become conscious of being morally bound, we acknowledge "a

sequently, whatever reasons an agent's normative identity as rational gives him must be public and shareable too. Therefore, the rational nature of others is no less normative for him than is his own.

The problem with this strategy is that any lesson that can be drawn from Wittgenstein's private language argument is quite general and applies in theoretical reasoning no less than in practical reasoning. Moreover, theoretical inquiry is no less self-reflexive than is practical deliberation. A rational believer, like a rational agent, must be able to see herself as "something over and above" her inclinations (in this case, to beliefs as these are given in experience). And, as we have seen, she must also see her reasoning as free of determination by alien causes and guided by rational norms. Finally, in inquiry we are guided by a rational conception of ourselves as theoretical reasoners no less than we are by a practical identity in deliberation. We must give ourselves a kind of authority in our own reasoning about what to believe no less than we must in deliberation. It follows that these considerations, taken by themselves, are insufficient to establish autonomy or anything that is equivalent to it, since they are consistent with the sort of heteronomy that characterizes theoretical reasoning. For example, they are consistent with the Moorean realism of the naïve deliberative standpoint. Of course, Korsgaard would reject realism of this form, as would I. But the point is that nothing in the argument from practical identity or the impossibility of a private language itself rules Moorean realism out. So the argument cannot establish autonomy or the moral law.

determining ground" that cannot "be outweighed by any sensible conditions" and that is "quite independent of them." And this "leads directly to the concept of freedom" (29–30).

Kant makes his point with a pair of vivid examples. The first involves someone who claims to be subject to an irresistible lust. Kant's comments here are in a compatibilist vein: such a person could surely control his lust if he were threatened with hanging on a gallows "erected in front of the house where he finds this opportunity" (1996a: 30). That he can control his lust in this sense, however, is consistent with his behavior's being determined entirely by his currently strongest inclination or objectdependent desire. It just shows that in altered circumstances, some other object-dependent desire would have been stronger. And maybe he has some such desire, perhaps the desire for self-preservation, that would override, not just his lust, but also any other desire, including any principle-dependent desire that is necessary to motivate genuinely moral action.

Kant's second example is addressed to this very possibility. Here we are to imagine someone whose prince demands "on pain of the same immediate execution, that he give false testimony against an honorable man whom the prince would like to destroy under a plausible pretext." Whether this person would refuse to do such a thing, Kant writes, "he would perhaps not venture to assert." But whether he would or he wouldn't, he "must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for him."

He judges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware that he ought to do it and cognizes freedom within him, which, without the moral law, would have remained unknown to him. (1996a: 30)

Once he acknowledges that he should refuse to comply with his prince's demand even on pain of execution, he cannot coherently think it impossible for him to refuse owing to an irresistible desire for selfpreservation. The point seems to follow from the nature of a deliberative (normative) practical judgment. Were he to suppose his desire for selfpreservation to be literally irresistible, he would be forced, in reasoning practically in light of that, to conclude that he should do something else after all, he can't give uphis life. But Kant evidently thinks that nobody really believes there is anything else he should do in this case other than refuse to betray an honorable man. When we're being honest with ourselves, we acknowledge that we shouldn't give in to a corrupt tyrant to destroy an honest person, perhaps even at the pain of our own death. And if we acknowledge that, then we are also forced to assume that that is something we can refuse to do.35

Kant is here simply drawing out the logical consequences of what he takes to be already involved in accepting the bindingness of the moral law. The consciousness of the moral law is, he says, a "fact of reason"

because one cannot reason it out from antecedent data of reason, for example, from consciousness of freedom (since this is not antecedently given to us) and because it instead forces itself upon us of itself as a synthetic *a priori* proposition. (1996a: 31)

Kant clearly believes that his readers will agree with his moral phenomenology if they will just be honest with themselves, and we can read the example as being offered in that spirit. We put ourselves into the shoes of the person in the example, simulate practical thought from that perspective, and agree that in those circumstances the thing to do is to refuse the corrupt tyrant's offer and not have an honest person's death on our hands. Do we think we would do that? Surely we hope so, but alas, we also know the results of the Milgram experiment. But we must accept that we could.

Obviously these reflections are impotent to establish that the moral law

<sup>35</sup> Recall, at this point, Foot's point (1972) that suitably qualified ought claims, like those of etiquette, are not necessarily practically normative; they do not entail supremely authoritative, or even necessarily any genuinely normative, reasons for acting. There is no incoherence in thinking that one is utterly incapable of doing what etiquette requires or recommends. Even apart from psychic obstacles, there may be physical bars that make it impossible to set a proper table. One may simply lack enough forks. Similarly, there may be ways of attempting, at least, to cancel the normative force that moral oughts and obligations typically purport to have and qualify them in the way that those of etiquette already seem to be. Inverted commas or a suitable inflection may enable one to express the thought that although refusing the prince's demand is what one should do, "you know, morally speaking," one is unable to comply. But Kant's point is that it is simply deliberatively incoherent to think that the prince's offer is irresistible in the sense of being literally impossible to refuse *if* one also thinks one should refuse it as a deliberative thought, that is, as a conclusion of a chain of practical reasoning. After all, if it is impossible, then it is nothing you can coherently consider doing and so you must conclude that what you should do is something else. For a very helpful discussion of 'ought' implies 'can' in this vein, see Vranas unpublished. Vranas argues that it 'ought implies can' is conceptually necessary, where 'can' has the sense of 'has the ability and the opportunity'.

is binding, however, since they already presuppose that we accept that (although they might inspire a cynic who has sought to evade what he himself most deeply believes). But Kant is no longer attempting to give a positive argument that morality is not illusory. He is employing a strategy that Rawls calls "philosophy as defense," showing how we need not give upour acceptance of the moral law once we already have it. In a way, this strategy is like Strawson's in "Freedom and Resentment." Is the possibility that the will is not free (or autonomous) a threat to morality? Well, it might be if we had to establish autonomy as a premise before we could defensibly think we are morally bound. But we don't have to worry about that. We begin already accepting certain moral claims and ideas including, Kant thinks, the bindingness of the moral law. And once we have that, we must accept autonomy on pain of deliberative incoherence. Of course, if someone could establish that we lack the very condition that our being morally obligated presupposes, then we'd have a problem.

However, even if we don't need a philosophical argument to convince us that the moral law is supremely authoritative, we still have a philosophical interest in understanding why it is.36 I believe, as I begin to show in the next chapter, that the answer is to be found in the second-person standpoint. To conclude this chapter, however, let me note a way in which the second-person perspective is actually required to underwrite the use to which Kant puts the "fact of reason" in the second *Critique.*

Just after the passage we have been discussing, Kant presents what he calls the Fundamental Law of Pure Practical Reason (FPP): "So act that the maxim of your will could always hold at the same time as a principle in a giving of universal law" (1996a: 30). This is, in essentials, the same as the more formal versions of the CI from the *Groundwork*: FUL (Formula of Universal Law: "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law") and FLN (Formula of the Law of Nature: "Act as if the maxim of your action were to become by your will a universal law of nature") (1996b: 421). But why, we should ask, does Kant think that the fact of reason supports a formal principle like FPP? The reasoning in the Remark that follows

<sup>36</sup> Or, if one supposes it to be a conceptual truth that the moral law is supremely authoritative, we have an interest in understanding what makes something we take to be a moral law one in fact. The conceptual truth would only be that if anything is a moral law, then it is supremely authoritative.

FPP appeals essentially to autonomy of the will: "The will is thought as independent of empirical conditions and hence, as a pure will, as determined by the mere form of law." Then Kant says, again, "Consciousness of this fundamental law may be called a fact of reason... because it forces itself upon us of itself as a synthetic *a priori* proposition" (1996a: 31).

But what exactly is the connection between the claim that since one should do what the moral law requires and refuse the prince's demand, one can so refuse, on the one hand, and either autonomy of the will as Kant understands it or FPP, on the other? The connection between autonomy and FPP seems clear enough. But what does the "fact of reason" example have to do with either autonomy or FPP? A Rossian deontological intuitionist could easily grant what Kant says about the example and generalize from it that whatever a person morally ought to do must be something she can do. But why should he conclude FPP from that? Couldn't he deny that any principle like FPP underlies the list of duties he accepts or that such a formal principle is required to explain why it would be wrong to give in to the prince? Couldn't he even deny the FPP?

If he agrees with Kant about the example and about 'ought' implies 'can', why should he be led from that to autonomy of the will? Deontological intuitionists deny autonomy, as we noted earlier, since they hold that actions (objects of volition) can be intrinsically right or wrong and that the law derives from that. Nothing in what Kant says about the example should lead them to abandon this position. And if Kant adds that we are directly conscious of the CI as a synthetic *a priori* principle, then it seems he is simply fighting deontological intuitionists on their own turf and just disagreeing about whether moral duties can be summed into a single principle. In any case, there seems no obvious route from the "fact of reason" to autonomy of the will or FPP.37

### **The Fact of Reason: A Second-Personal Interpretation**

Now I believe that there actually is an argument for FPP and the CI that can be made from intuitive examples like the one Kant presents. However, such an argument would rely on the second-personal aspect of moral obligation: its conceptual tie to accountability. Recall, first, that the

<sup>37</sup> Of course, if the "fact of reason" itself includes awareness of the CI, then there is no stepto take.

sense of 'can' that is in play in Kant's own discussion is simply that of an open deliberative alternative, that is, something such that one's abilities and opportunities with respect to it do not preclude intelligible consideration of whether to do it. That is why 'ought' implies 'can' in that sense is so obviously true. 'Ought' has the sense of a deliberation-concluding normative judgment: This, of the things I can do, is what I ought to do. But now note that the fact that someone can do something in this sense is entirely consistent with her not knowing that she ought to do it, with her not being able to know it, and with her lacking any formal process of practical reasoning (involving a principle like FPP) through which could she could determine that this is what she should do and determine herself to act accordingly. A Rossian intuitionist, for example, can hold that someone (call her "Citizen") ought to refuse the prince's demand even if she doesn't know she should do so, couldn't know she should, and had no process of reasoning, like FPP or the CI through which she could discover this or determine herself to do so. Even so, the Rossian can agree with Kant that, since Citizen ought to refuse the prince's demand, she can do so. But, again, that doesn't entail anything about the CI or autonomy.

It is common ground that Citizen is morally obligated to refuse the prince's demand, that it would be wrong for her not to do so, and that that is therefore what she should do and, consequently, what she can do. As I argued in Chapter 5, however, if this is what Citizen is morally obligated to do, then it is also what she is accountable or responsible for doing; it is what the moral community (and she as a member) has the authority to demand that she do. Now if we, as members of the moral community, accept second-personal norms that support these demands, and, on this basis, address this proposition to Citizen,38 we are not simply informing her of how things are "in the moral community," as an anthropologist might inform someone of mores he does not himself accept. We implicitly address the demands to Citizen and put them forward as authoritative, as, indeed, does Citizen herself when she acknowledges the moral obligation.

We relate to Citizen through "moral address" (Watson 1987: 263, 264). In so doing, moreover, we are subject to Watsonian "constraints of moral address," that is, conditions that must be satisfied for the addressing of

<sup>38</sup> Or, indeed, if Citizen addresses it to herself.

demands, holding responsible, blaming, and so forth, to be intelligible in their own terms. (As I have alternatively been putting it, these are normative felicity conditions of the second-personal reason we attempt to address existing and, hence, of the success of our address.) Thus, although there is no conceptual pressure to hold that the mere existence of good and sufficient reasons for someone to do something entails that he knows or even can know this (would that it were so!), it does seem to be a conceptual requirement of blaming and holding Citizen responsible for not refusing the prince's demand (if she fails to) that we presuppose that she must have been in a position to know that she should have refused and that she could have determined herself to refuse by the relevant reasons.

When we hold people responsible, we imply that they had it within them to act as they should, not just in the sense that the alternatives were open to them or that they weren't physically prevented, but that there was a process of reasoning they could have engaged in by which they could have held themselves responsible and determined themselves to act as they should have. We imply that they could have decided to do it by, in Bernard Williams's words, a "sound deliberative route" (1981a). (Recall that Williams himself [1995] argues that blame presupposes this (Williams thinks illicitly).) But what reasoning process can we assume that those subject to moral obligations must have available to them? Kant's idea is that it would have to be a procedure that is itself tied to what it is that makes us subject to moral obligation in the first place, our being rational wills, and therefore that it must be tied somehow to the "form" of the will. The CI and the FPP are Kant's proposals for the requisite reasoning process, in effect, *the form that moral reasoning would have to take if it is to lead us to conclusions that we can intelligibly be held responsible for reaching.* And autonomy of the will follows as a corollary. But my point is that it takes a focus on the second-personal aspect of moral obligation to appreciate the connection between thinking that Citizen is morally obligated (responsible for refusing) and thinking that there must be a process of reasoning (the CI or FPP) through which she could have determined her obligation and determined herself to refuse. A second-personal interpretation of this Kantian claim is that (something like) CI reasoning is part of second-personal competence.

We get to substantially the same conclusion if we think through the role of second-personal competence in holding one another accountable.

When we hold each other responsible for complying with moral obligations as fellow members of the moral community, we imply that we each can also hold ourselves responsible. But this requires us to regiment moral demands by what anyone could accept as a sensible demand of everyone as equal members of a community of mutually accountable equals, and thereby demand of herself. In Chapter 12, I argue that the CI, especially in the Realm of Ends formulation (FRE), is an interpretation of this intuitive idea, that is, CI is a formulation of the reasoning process that constitutes the second-personal competence we presuppose when we hold one another responsible for complying with moral demands.

What is fundamental in this way of thinking is the second-personal authority that I have been claiming is an essential aspect of the dignity of persons: the (equal) authority that persons have, as such, to make claims on and demands of one another at all. Autonomy of the will and the necessity of a formal deliberative process derive from this more fundamental idea—as necessary conditions for the possibility of second-personal authority and as necessary to mediate second-personal relations—rather than vice versa. There can be second-personal authority only if there is second-personal competence. And persons can be assumed to have second-personal competence only if we can assume autonomy and some form of moral reasoning like the CI. People can sensibly be held accountable for complying with norms only if they can themselves accept and determine themselves by them (Pufendorf 's Point). But that can be guaranteed to be so only if what makes the demand-warranting norms valid is their issuing from a process that people can, at least in principle, go through in their own reasoning and thereby make the relevant demands of themselves.

If, however, the dignity of persons, conceived as equal second-personal authority, is the fundamental moral notion, what commits us to that idea? Why should we accept that it is not a chimerical idea itself? We now have almost all the materials we need to answer that question.

## 10. Dignity and the Second Person: Variations on Fichtean Themes

A human being regarded as a *person,* that is as the subject of a morally practical reason,...possesses a *dignity* . . . by which he exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world.... Humanity in his person is the object of the respect which he can demand from every other human being.

—immanuel kant, metaphysical first principles of the doctrine of virtue

In this chapter, I argue that the key to validating our dignity as persons is to appreciate what might be meant by saying, as Kant does in the passage above, that dignity is something by which we "exact" or "claim" respect "from every other human being." Respect that acknowledges the validity of a claim is, as we saw in Chapter 6, second-personal, as are also the claim and the authority to make it. And the dignity of persons, I there argued, is the second-personal standing of an equal. It is the status of an equal member of the moral community (the "realm of ends") to hold one another accountable for compliance with the mandatory norms that mediate relations between free and rational persons. When, consequently, someone respects another's dignity as a person, she gives him the second-personal standing of an equal in her relations with him.

As we noted in Chapter 1, dignity partly involves there being constraints on the permissible treatment of persons, ways one must act toward persons and ways one must not (Kamm 1989, 1992; Nagel 1995). But that is only part of it, since there can be requirements on us that no one has any standing to require of us.1 The latter is what being in a position to claim or "exact" respect brings in—the authority to demand compliance with dignity's requirements through mutual accountability.

<sup>1</sup> Logical requirements, for example. See the discussion of this point in Chapter 1.

Thought of in this way, dignity includes equal status in the moral community, understood as a cooperative of mutually accountable free and rational agents.2 The dignity of persons, we might then say, is the complex whole that comprises all three of the following: the substantive mandatory norms regarding conduct toward persons, the standing to demand compliance with these as one among mutually accountable equals, and valid demands that are grounded in this authority.3 (Again, I argue in Chapter 12 that the content of specific moral requirements can be explicated within a contractualist framework that is itself grounded in the second-person standpoint. The present chapter seeks to show that the second-person perspective is committed to dignity conceived as shared basic second-personal authority. Chapter 12 argues that procedural versions of the CI, including a contractualist interpretation of the Realm of Ends formulation (FRE), can be grounded in this authority.)

But what commits us to this standing? Why should we suppose that we have the authority to claim anything from one another simply as equal persons? If the reasoning of the last chapter is correct, then even if the moral law, the dignity of persons, and autonomy of the will are all reciprocally related to one another, nothing within first-personal practical reasoning alone requires us to accept any of these. An agent might deliberate intelligibly (from a naïve first-personal standpoint) on the assumption that all are chimerical ideas. In the current chapter, I lay out reasons for thinking that dignity and autonomy (second-personal authority and competence) are inescapably presupposed in the second-person stance, and I begin to make the case, the main part of which is presented in the chapter following, that an account of second-personal practical thought is central to a fully adequate account of practical reason.

If, however, the moral law is essentially tied to the dignity of persons,

<sup>2</sup> Moreover, there may be moral obligations that extend beyond the treatment of persons, for example, the treatment of other animals who are not persons and the treatment of the environment. The dignity of persons shows itself in these cases also, since it involves membershipin the moral community to whom all are accountable for complying with these demands.

<sup>3</sup> Moral obligations must thus be understood as involving implicit demands that are "in force," as I noted in Chapter 1, even when actual individuals have not explicitly made them. As Strawson points out, "the making of the demand *is* the proneness to [reactive] attitudes" (1968: 92–93). This, again, is like Hart's interpretation of Bentham's account of law (1990: 93–94) involving "quasi-commands." See the discussion of this point in note 17 of Chapter 1.

and if dignity includes an irreducibly second-personal standing, then it should not be surprising that the second-person perspective is essential to appreciating the bindingness of the moral law. No authority to address second-personal reasons of any kind is reducible to propositions of value or normative principles of right that can adequately be appreciated either first- or third-personally, since nothing of this sort will itself include the irreducibly second-personal element of claim or demand.4 If, consequently, persons have the standing to make claims of one another as free and rational, this must be something we are committed to from within the second-person perspective. Moreover, in my view, it is a commitment to the equal dignity of persons in this irreducibly second-personal way that brings along with it a commitment to autonomy of the will and the CI, rather than vice versa.

### **Prelude: Assembling the Materials**

Our goal in this chapter, then, is to construct an argument for the claim that the dignity of persons, conceived of as a shared basic second-personal authority, is inescapably presupposed from the second-person standpoint as a normative felicity condition of addressing second-personal reasons and, therefore, that autonomy of the will is as well. We hope to conclude that addressing any second-personal reason whatsoever will necessarily commit one to these two assumptions. By now, we have in hand many of the materials we need for such an argument, including Strawson's and Pufendorf 's Points. In this section, we briefly survey these so that we can, in succeeding sections, combine them with ideas of Fichte's about second-personal address in general to produce a convincing argument. Fichte claims that second-personal address always presumes, as such, to direct an agent's will through that agent's own free choice. It attempts to make a claim on her through an address to her as a free and rational agent. We can call this *Fichte's Analysis* of second-personal address.

*Fichte's Point,* then, is that there are two conditions that must be satisfied for second-personal address, so analyzed, to succeed; hence there are two assumptions that any attempt to address someone second-

<sup>4</sup> Obviously, I mean here to exclude such third-personal propositions as that *A* has the authority to demand that *B* get off his foot (which essentially includes the idea of a claim or demand that is addressable second-personally). And as well, first-personal propositions that are also second-personal.

personally is committed to making.5 The first is that the addresser and the addressee share an equal authority to make claims of one another as free and rational. And the second is that they share a freedom to act on claims that are rooted in this authority. Fichte's Point, as I am interpreting him, is that any second-personal address whatsoever must simultaneously presuppose this second-personal authority and second-personal competence.6 Indeed, being second-personally competent is what we should understand 'free' in the phrase 'free and rational' to refer to.7 In effect, then, our aim in this chapter is to construct an argument for Fichte's Point. I believe that this can be done by combining Fichte's Analysis with Strawson's and Pufendorf 's Points.

strawson's point. Holding someone responsible always addresses a demand, and the only way to justify any such demand is with second-personal reasons, that is, from within the standpoint we must occupy to address it. Otherwise, we will be invoking "reasons of the wrong kind." This gives us the framework of four interdefinable, irreducibly second-personal notions we have identified: (1) addressable demands, (2) the authority to address them, (3) second-personal reasons that are implicit in their address, and (4) accountability to others. Any one of these four notions implicitly involves the other three, and there is no way to reduce the distinctive normativity of any one of them to norms and values that can be appreciated fully without a second-person standpoint.

Strawson makes these points about moral responsibility in particular, but nothing restricts their application to the moral case. Whenever someone puts forward a putatively valid claim or demand of any kind, she purports to initiate a second-personal relation that inevitably involves all four concepts. Two elements of this framework are especially relevant to

<sup>5</sup> As always throughout this book, I mean: for it to succeed normatively, that is, as I have put it, that there are two "normative felicity conditions" of second-personal address. This means, again, that there are two conditions that second-personal address must satisfy for the (normative) reasons it attempts to address actually to exist and be given. second-personal address may succeed in conventional (Austinian) terms by contrast, for example, a speech act may constitute a command, if relevant authority exists *de facto,* whether or not it exists *de jure.*

<sup>6</sup> Here again, I mean that this is a presupposition to which the address is conceptually committed, not that the anyone who addresses another second-personally actually presupposes it.

<sup>7</sup> As in "equal authority to make claims of one another as free and rational."

the argument of the current chapter. One is the connection between addressing demands and accountability. To address a demand is invariably to attempt to initiate a relation whereby the addressee can be presumed responsible for complying with the demand. (Conversely, holding someone responsible invariably addresses demands.) As we have seen, it is impossible for any such attempt to succeed unless a more general accountability relation already obtains between addresser and addressee, which relation both presuppose in addressing and acknowledging the demand respectively. This is the version of Strawson's Point we called Cudworth's Point, which we saw in Cudworth's critique of theological voluntarism and which I appealed to in discussing Gilbert and Scanlon at the end of Chapter 8. God cannot obligate us by specific commands unless we are already accountable to him in general, and it is impossible for you and me to agree to take a walk together, or for either of us individually to promise unless we already have the second-personal authority to make or refuse agreements or to give or receive promises, as we presuppose when one of us issues an invitation or attempts to make a promise and the other accepts or declines.

The second element is the distinctive kind of reason for acting that authoritative demands invariably address taken together with the capacity to act on a reason of this kind (second-personal competence) that we presuppose when we address any such demand. Second-personal reasons are authority-regarding rather than outcome-regarding or state-of-theworld-regarding. Recall our initial example, in which you are in pain because someone is stepping on your foot. The fact that you are suffering pain that might be relieved by someone's moving his foot is, in itself, an agent-neutral, outcome-regarding, non-second-personal reason for him to move it. Such a person is simply in an especially good position to bring about a better state of the world; this reason for him to do so is one that is also had, in principle, by anyone who can bring about this state. If, however, you address a demand to him that he move his foot (since he had no right to stepon yours in the first place), the reason you attempt to give him is authority-regarding rather than state-of-the-worldregarding; it is agent-relative and second-personal. In addressing the demand, you need not presuppose that he has a reason to bring about the relief of your pain because it is a better state. What you presuppose is rather that you have the authority to demand that he move his foot, that there is therefore a reason for him to do so (whether he wants to or thinks that would be a particularly good thing or not), and, finally, that he is accountable for doing so.

Now as we saw at the end of the last chapter, when we hold one another morally responsible, we presuppose that we can each comply with moral requirements, not just in the weak sense of having the ability and the opportunity to do so, but in the stronger sense of having the capacity to recognize and (freely) act on the distinctive second-personal reasons they involve. And we saw also that this requires us to presuppose that we have the capacity to act on reasons that are rooted simply in the second-personal authority of a free and rational agent as such and that are consequently independent "of any features of the objects of volition."8 Moral accountability thus presupposes autonomy of the will. We can be held morally responsible only for what we can hold ourselves responsible for by making moral demands of ourselves from the perspective of one free and rational agent among others.9

I contend that one consequence of Fichte's Analysis is that these presuppositions are not limited to the moral case; they are invariably implicated in second-personal address. Any second-personal reason whatsoever is authority- rather than outcome-regarding, and any address of a second-personal reason purports to initiate an accountability relation in which both parties are responsible to one another as rational and free (second-personally competent). In effect, then, it is a consequence of Fichte's Analysis that second-personal address must always presuppose autonomy and the dignity of persons. If the address of any second-personal reason is to an agent as free and rational, then being accountable for compliance must involve the addressee's capacity freely to determine herself by reasons that are grounded in a second-personal competence and authority that addresser and addressee must be presumed to have in common.10

<sup>8</sup> There are two elements here. First, we must presuppose that we can act on the relevant agent-relative norm (say, not to stepon one another's feet). Second, but no less important, we have to assume that we can hold one another, and ourselves, responsible for so complying. So we must assume that in being subject to moral demands, we have these two interlocked motivational capacities, which assumption amounts to autonomy of the will. I am indebted to Ryan Preston for discussion of this point.

<sup>9</sup> As Kant puts it, "I can recognize that I am under obligation to others only insofar as I at the same time put myself under obligation" (1996d: 417–418).

<sup>10</sup> With second-personal reasons other than those deriving from moral obligations, however, the presupposition is only that the agent can freely determine herself to act on these reasons *pro tanto,* that is, other reasons to the contrary notwithstanding.

Second-personal address must always presuppose shared second-personal authority and second-personal competence.

pufendorf's point. The second element we will need for our argument is Pufendorf 's Point, which Pufendorf puts forward as a claim about moral motivation. In order for God's commands to create obligations, we must be able to distinguish between someone being moved to comply by fear of, or by the desire to avoid, God's sanctions, on the one hand, and his being moved by the conviction that the sanction "falls upon him justly," on the other (1934: 91).11 We can be genuinely obligated to comply with God's commands only if we have the capacity to accept his authority and to determine ourselves freely by this acceptance. We must have second-personal competence.

One way we have been putting this point is by saying that to be subject to an obligation and be, consequently, responsible for compliance, the obligated agent must be capable of holding himself responsible. To do this, he must be able to see the addresser's claim or demand not just as externally imposed even as imposed justifiably from the addresser's perspective, but as something he, the addressee, justifiably demands of himself from a standpoint that he and his addressee can share. He must be able to think not just that someone else might have reason to reproach him were he not to comply but also that he would be to blame, that there would be warrant for him to blame himself.

This is Pufendorf 's Point from, as it were, the addressee's perspective. But it has two corollaries from the addresser's perspective. First, although special authority may carry distinctive forms of accountability of an addressee to a specially authorized addresser, there must always also be an underlying presupposed authority to hold responsible that addresser and addressee have in common. Any special authority must still presuppose that an addressee's failure to comply would be an appropriate object of blame and other reactive attitudes, and these, as Strawson pointed out, always implicate the perspective of second-personally competent persons as such (the moral community). For the addresser to think that an addressee would be to blame for not complying with her demand, she must think, not just that she (the addresser) would have standing to complain,

<sup>11</sup> Not just in the Hobbesian sense that God does no wrong in applying it, but that God has the authority to apply it.

but that her addressee would be to blame, that is, the addressee would be appropriately blamed by anyone.12 She must think that her addressee has the same basic authority to blame himself that she has to blame him.

Second, Pufendorf 's distinction from an addressee's perspective between acting on a desire to avoid sanctions and acting on a second-personal reason generates a complementary distinction from the addresser's point of view. Any addresser of a second-personal reason is committed to there being a difference between relating to someone in "demanding" (directive) ways in making a valid demand or holding him responsible for complying with it, on the one hand, and merely forcing him to comply, for example, by threatening some evil, on the other. Part of the very idea of accountability is that there must be something (call it a "sanction" or "consequence") that someone with the authority to hold a person responsible can demand that the person accept if he fails to do what he is responsible for doing. Exactly what an appropriate consequence would be is a normative rather than a conceptual question. In theory, it could consist in no more than having to be the object of a reactive attitude, to listen to a charge, to acknowledge responsibility or guilt, or maybe even something weaker. But what is not left open by the concept is liability to a consequence of some kind, that is, that some consequence would "fall upon" one justly so that accepting it would help constitute one's taking responsibility for what one has done.

The idea of accountability therefore requires a distinction between the authority to put someone on notice of a sanction as part of holding him accountable, on the one hand, and illegitimately threatening the very same evil without this authority, that is, coercion, on the other. It follows that someone who addresses a demand or puts someone on notice of a purportedly valid sanction presupposes that, although she may act toward the other in this directive or "demanding" way because of her authority, she could not legitimately do so if she lacked the relevant authority. Without that authority, what would have been a valid notice of sanction becomes coercion, and this would violate the addressee's authority. Indeed, without the relevant authority, even the attempt to direct the agent's will by making the demand in the first place would be coercion.13 She is

<sup>13</sup> I am indebted to Jacob Ross for this point.

<sup>12</sup> One way to see this is to ask what otherwise the complaint could consist in. Having the standing to say, "You shouldn't have done that" will simply be empty unless the complaint itself is something the addressee can be expected to accept.

committed, therefore, to the idea that *it takes second-personal authority to have a justification of the right kind (second-personal reasons) to direct the will of another free and rational agent.*

We can see this in the phenomenon of blame itself. Reactive attitudes exert a kind of directive pressure on their objects. We naturally resent therefore being the object of resentment we think unwarranted. But blame is not influence pure and simple. Blame purports to be a second-personally warranted form of influence, to be justified, that is, by an authority its object can accept because it springs, ultimately, from the same authority he himself has, and must accept himself as having, in being an accountable agent at all. When we blame someone, we "view him as a member of the moral community; only as one who has offended against its demands" (Strawson 1968: 93). So in blaming him, we acknowledge his authority and implicitly acknowledge that if we didn't have second-personally adequate grounds for blame, then our directive influence would be illegitimate; it would be a violation of his authority.

Pufendorf 's Point mirrors our analysis of the second-personal features of Kant's example of the "fact of reason." Citizen, from our example in Chapter 9, must choose between complying with her moral obligation not to betray an honest person (and collude with a tyrant), on the one hand, and saving her skin, on the other. Part of Kant's point is that we recognize that we can do as we morally ought, our fear and desire for self-preservation to the contrary notwithstanding. And I argued that, if we attend to the presuppositions of moral responsibility, we will agree not just that complying with moral obligations is always deliberatively open to us but that we can act as we are obligated for the very reasons that we are obligated. And this commits us to Pufendorf 's distinction between being moved by fear of some evil consequence and being moved by our acceptance of the moral obligation (in our terms, by accepting the moral community's authority to demand compliance and, identifying with this perspective, making the demand second-personally of ourselves).

Pufendorf 's Point and this second-personal analysis of the "fact of reason" are both advanced, like Strawson's Point, with respect to moral obligation and responsibility in particular. But a lesson of Fichte's Analysis is that whenever we address demands and assume the authority to hold one another responsible, we commit ourselves to Pufendorf 's distinction in both its addressees' and addressers' versions. We presuppose a distinction between being moved by desires for goods or evils, on the one hand, and being moved by an acceptance of the relevant second-personal reasons (and thereby making the relevant demands of ourselves), on the other. And we commit ourselves to the complementary distinction between legitimately attempting to direct someone's will with the relevant second-personal authority and illegitimately imposing our will on him, thus violating his authority as a free and rational person.

### **Fichte's Analysis: Second-Personal Address and Free Practical Reason**

We can begin to work toward an argument for Fichte's Point by attempting first to understand Fichte's Analysis. Fichte calls any second-personal address a "summons" *(Aufforderung).* And he argues that issuing or acknowledging a summons commits addresser and addressee alike to recognizing what he calls the "principle of right": "I must in all cases recognize the free being outside me as a free being, i.e., I must limit my freedom through the concept of the possibility of his freedom" (2000: 49).14 Considerations of the right are thus second-personal reasons that are rooted in a common authority that you and I have as free and rational. And Fichte argues also that any summons presupposes the freedom of both addresser and addressee to act on these reasons. His claim, as I interpret it, is that any summons commits both parties to recognizing the principle of right as well as the freedom of addresser and addressee to act on the second-personal reasons it encodes.

I should emphasize that I extend Fichte's claims and arguments farther than he does or would himself.15 For reasons I cannot adequately discuss here, Fichte distinguishes between moral duty and the right, and he understands enforceable constraints of right as "technical" or "practical," that is, as hypothetical requirements that agents are committed to only

<sup>14</sup> It will ease exposition if I sometimes say that it "presupposes" or "assumes" this. I mean this in the sense I hope is now familiar, namely, that the presupposition is a normative felicity condition of a second-personal reason's being successfully addressed, whether or not the addresser presupposes this in fact.

<sup>15</sup> So Fichte might himself reject what I am calling "Fichte's Point." I argue, however, that the point is implicit in his arguments. Whether he would be convinced and accept the credit I am attempting to bestow upon him I cannot of course say. (Second-personal relations are especially complex when spread out over two centuries.)

insofar as they aim to live together.16 I believe, however, that Fichte's ideas support, indeed that they require, the stronger proposition that second-personal address invariably presupposes categorical requirements rooted in the dignity of persons (second-personal authority) along with autonomy of the will (second-personal competence).

Fichte connects his analysis of second-personal address to a fundamental distinction he makes between the kinds of freedom that are involved in theoretical and practical reason, respectively. When you and I reason about what to believe, we aim to construct representations of a common world, to "represent... objects" as they are "apart from any contribution by us" (2000: 19). In theoretical reasoning, our perspectives are the way the world is, according to each of us respectively.17 If, consequently, you have reason to think that my view of things is mistaken or skewed, you may discount my beliefs as mere appearances when forming yours.

From the second-person standpoint, however, we see that nothing analogous can hold in practical reasoning (naïve first-personal deliberation to the contrary notwithstanding). When you and I make claims on one another's will, we take ourselves to be free to act on reasons that are grounded not in our relations to an independent ordering of the value of different outcomes or possible states of the world but just in our authority with respect to each other. Our respective practical perspectives are thus not simply standpoints on an independent something and discountable when they reflect it poorly. Fichte's Point is that they are the perspectives from which we lead our lives as free and independent rational agents and relate to one another on terms that respect this status. When we make claims on each other second-personally, we acknowledge a source of reasons and a kind of freedom—second-personal authority and second-personal competence—that make practical reason fundamentally different from theoretical reason.

Like Kant, therefore, Fichte is committed to practical reason's embodying a form of freedom that goes beyond any species, positive or negative, that is presupposed in theoretical reasoning (or in naïve first-personal practical reasoning). Agency itself involves, Fichte claims, a "positing" of

<sup>16</sup> For a more extended discussion, see Darwall 2005, from which I here draw. See also Frederick Neuhouser's introduction to Fichte 2000 and Neuhouser 1994.

<sup>17</sup> This is a conceptual point about the nature of belief that needs to be accounted for even within an idealist framework like Fichte's.

oneself as an agent, and an agent cannot "posit itself without ascribing free efficacy to itself" (2000: 4, 18). Fichte stresses, moreover, that the "free efficacy" we assume in practical reasoning differs from any we must presuppose in rationally representing or "intuiting a world." Any such representing is "*constrained* and *bound* with respect to its content."18 Belief, by its very nature, aims to represent the world as it actually is. The activity involved in an agent's self-positing, by contrast, is "opposed to such representational activity" and "*free* with respect to its content" (19). In the terms we developed in the last chapter, it involves a kind of freedom that goes beyond any a naïve agent must assume.

But neither, and again like Kant, is practical freedom for Fichte simply the capacity to set ends.19 (For Kant, recall, it also includes autonomy.) Fichte does say that "what is contained first and foremost in the concept of freedom is nothing but the capacity to construct, through absolute spontaneity, concepts of our possible efficacy," or "the concept of an *end*" (2000: 9, 20). However, Fichte adds: "But if a rational individual, or a person, is to find himself as free, then something more is required" (9). What free agency involves beyond the ability to set ends (formal freedom) is a "positing" of our own free agency. And Fichte maintains, as we see in the next section, that we posit ourselves as free agents from a secondperson standpoint.

For Fichte, it is second-personal engagement that makes us aware of a kind of freedom we have that is fundamentally unlike any that is involved in theoretical reasoning or in practical reasoning from a naïve first-person standpoint. Fichte believes that second-personal engagement commits addresser and addressee alike to limiting their "external freedom" through the "principle of right."20 In so doing, each "lets his own external freedom be limited through inner freedom" (2000: 10). "Inner freedom" must thus include second-personal competence. Addresser and addressee freely restrict their external freedom when they accept one another's authority and impose demands on themselves (the principle of right) that either person would make on both from a standpoint they can both share as rational and free (second-personally competent). As I interpret it, there-

<sup>18</sup> Again, I take Fichte to be making a conceptual point here that even an idealist framework must respect.

<sup>20</sup> Like Kant, Fichte uses "external freedom" to refer to a legally protectable sphere of free movement or action (1996c: 214).

fore, Fichtean "inner freedom" (second-personal competence) is the formal analogue of Kant's autonomy of the will.

### **Fichte's Analysis: Positing Agency and Second-Personal Reasons**

But why does Fichte suppose that we "posit" ourselves as free agents from a second-person standpoint? In the first-person perspective, agency is "backgrounded" and no part of the agent's "deliberative field."21 A deliberating agent's focus is on the alternatives she faces along with their supporting reasons. So unless the reasons are of a special agency-regarding sort, like second-personal reasons, it will not be on her own agency (Pettit and Smith 1990; Regan 2003a, 2003b). Consider, again, an agent occupying a naïve first-person standpoint, deliberating on the basis of her preferences, desires, or Moorean evaluations of possible outcomes. She sees possible states or outcomes as more or less desirable (worth bringing about) and possible actions as more or less likely to effect them. Her deliberation is instrumental and transparent with respect to her own agency—it looks through her will to what valuable outcomes she can achieve.22

When we deliberate second-personally, however, in the light of a "summons" from one rational agent to another "calling upon it to resolve to

<sup>21</sup> I take these illustrative terms from Pettit and Smith 1990 and Herman 1996.

<sup>22</sup> Perhaps, however, this is only true so long as we conceive of deliberation in consequentialist terms. What if the agent accepts agent-relative principles of conduct, such as that each person should keep her promises? Won't that give her a deliberative purchase on her own agency? We know from the "fact of reason" that in supposing she is bound by an agent-relative principle, an agent must presuppose that she can act on it. But as we also saw, this only requires her to suppose that this action is deliberatively open. It doesn't involve any presupposition of autonomy. Moreover, Kant believes that such a principle applies to one only on the condition of autonomy. So the question remains, What within the deliberative standpoint commits the agent to that assumption? On the instrumental conception of action, see Schapiro 2001.

In a somewhat similar vein, Scheffler argues that the very idea of holding oneself to a standard requires one to conceive of a source of reasons, a norm of action, that is not itself instrumental or outcome-based. As Scheffler acknowledges, however, this is consistent with the norm itself being consequentialist (like the Moorean norm to produce optimal outcomes I mentioned in the last chapter). Scheffler argues that this consequentialist possibility is, however, in tension with our normal human patterns of holding one another responsible through reactive attitudes. To credit these latter responses, however, is implicitly to credit the second-person standpoint. (See Scheffler 2004.)

exercise its efficacy,"23 we are required to posit the free agency of addresser and addressee alike as part of our reasoning (Fichte 2000: 31). Although agency is no doubt assumed in the background somehow in any deliberation, it is only from a second-person standpoint that the addresser's free agency (and that of addressees) must be posited, that is, brought into their reasoning as a premise. And when it is, addresser and addressee alike must also assume that both have the capacity to act on second-personal reasons, that both are second-personally competent.

The summons is to someone as a free agent (including as second-personally competent), so in being aware of it, the summoned is aware of herself as thus regarded. Taken only so far, however, this might be no different from an observer's awareness. That someone sees one as a free agent is but another aspect of the way things are in the world anyway, part of the causal order of things that might be made better or worse. What makes all the difference is that a summons addresses one second-personally; it comes with an RSVP. In taking it up, even in publicly considering whether to take it up, one per force relates-to-the-otherrelating-to-one-as-a-free-agent. One deliberates within a second-personal relationshipin which each reciprocally recognizes the other as a "you" to whom she is a "you" in return. The presuppositions of intelligible second-personal deliberative thought require that one deliberate on the assumption, that is, on the premise, that one and the other are both agents with second-personal competence. Through responding second-personally to a summons, "the subject acts in such a way that the concept of itself as a free being and the concept of the rational being outside it (as a free being like itself) are mutually determined and conditional" (Fichte 2000: 40). This gives us a practical perspective on our own agency that is irreducible to any consciousness we might have of ourselves as part of a causal order. One simultaneously "posits" oneself and the other as free and rational agents within one's own deliberation (9).

The most perspicuous interpretation of Fichte's idea is in terms of second-personal reasons. A summons is any attempt to address second-personal reasons to some free and rational (second-personally competent) agent. Only by addressing a second-personal reason can one agent attempt to direct the will of another through the other's free choice. "The rational being's activity is by no means to be determined and necessitated by the summons in the way that . . . an effect is necessitated by its cause;

<sup>23</sup> This could also be from the agent to herself (second-personally).

rather the rational being is to determine itself in consequence of the summons" (2000: 35). A summons attempts to give another agent (second-personal) reasons by which she can freely determine herself, and it does this by addressing the other as rational and free.24 This is Fichte's Analysis of second-personal address.

If one person attempts to give another reasons for acting that are not second-personal, then no second-personal address in the current sense is involved; no claim is made on the other's will and only epistemic authority is presupposed. In pointing to non-second-personal reasons for acting, an advisor does not aim to direct an advisee's will as such: "I'm not telling (demanding, requesting, etc.) you to do anything. I'm just giving you advice."25 Advice makes a claim not on an advisee's will or actions but on her beliefs about what there is reason for her to do. An advisor summons an advisee, not to act in some way or other, but only to believe that certain considerations are reasons for her to act. So an advisor addresses an advisee directly, not as an agent, but as a cognizer of practical reasons.

If, however, someone issues a request, order, or demand, say, if you ask someone to move his foot from on topof yours, then you address your addressee directly as an agent who is capable of freely determining himself to act on the reasons you address. And if he takes upyour address (which he cannot avoid doing if it is common between the two of you that he has listened and heard), then he reflects back a reciprocal address (as someone who has, like you, the standing and competence to address and act on second-personal reasons as well). Even a bare request addresses a second-personal reason that is additional to any non-second-personal reasons that might stand behind it, since it presupposes the normative standing to make the request.

### **Fichte's Point: The Principle of Right and Equal Dignity**

Now the kind of case Fichte has most especially in mind is a summons addressed to someone simply as one free and rational agent among others,

<sup>24</sup> Even if the only reason it explicitly addresses comes from a request so to determine herself.

<sup>25</sup> Of course, this is only true with respect to the advice itself. There is presumably an implied claim on the advisee's will in presuming on her time and attention in listening to and considering the advice. But then these would themselves presuppose second-personal reasons.

that is, as an equal. Thus, a request or a demand to another that he move his foot from on topof yours might most naturally be presented and interpreted as grounded in normative relations presumed to hold between free and rational persons as such. In interpreting your request as an address of such a (second-personal) reason, your addressee must presuppose that you are claiming a second-personal authority simply as a rational person with second-personal competence, which status you must assume he has also.

Presently we consider Fichte's claim that second-personal recognition commits both parties to the principle of right. It may seem no surprise that reciprocal recognition as an equal should lead to this conclusion, however, since it seems already to be packed into the premises framing such mutual respect in the first place. But what about an address that presupposes an unequal, unreciprocated authority of addresser over an addressee? On Fichte's Analysis, even hierarchical forms of second-personal address are fundamentally to another as a free and rational agent, since they address (second-personal) reasons by which the addressee can freely "determine [himself]" (2000: 35), and that is possible only if the addressee can accept the authority the addressee presupposes (simply as free and rational). So even the addresser of a demand that is presumed to be based in an unreciprocated, hierarchical authority must assume that the authority on which the demand is based is one the addressee can freely and rationally accept. Otherwise, we don't have a case of Fichtean second-personal address, but rather an attempt to influence or cause compliance in some other way that "depriv[es him] of [his] ability to act freely" (41).

In supposing, moreover, that an addressee is responsible for complying with a demand, an addresser is committed to a number of other assumptions that imply a second-personal authority issuing from second-personal competence. First, the addresser can intelligibly hold an addressee responsible for compliance only if she assumes that he can hold himself responsible. But the addressee can do this only if he can blame himself for not complying, that is, only if he can make the demand of himself from the same perspective from which he accepts the addresser's authority, that is, the standpoint of a free and rational agent. Likewise, second, to hold the addressee responsible, an addresser must assume that the addressee would be blameworthy for failing to comply with the demand. So the addresser must also assume that her own authority to blame the addressee for noncompliance comes ultimately from the very same point of view. She must think that were the addressee not to comply without excuse, he would be to blame period, that is, from a perspective that the addresser and addressee can share as free and rational. Third, in assuming that an addressee is responsible for complying with a demand, the addresser must presuppose that she has an authority to relate to the addressee in "demanding" ways that would be illegitimate were she to lack the authority.

Each of these assumptions commits an addresser to a second-personal authority deriving from second-personal competence. The first two illustrate the Strawsonian point that reactive attitudes like blame always involve an aspect of mutual accountability, since they are always addressed from the perspective of someone as a second-personally competent person (a member of the moral community) to someone as a(nother) second-personally competent person (and thus an equal member) (Strawson 1968: 93). They thereby ultimately derive their authority to address their implicit demands from this perspective. The third assumption makes explicit a point that is implicit already in the first two, namely, that the authority to hold responsible implies a distinction between legitimately relating to someone in "demanding" ways that, however directive, do not amount to coercion because they are warranted by second-personal reasons (reasons that, it is assumed, an addressee could himself freely accept and that holding himself responsible would require him to accept), on the one hand, and relating to him in the very same ways without the relevant authority, which would then be coercion and therefore an illegitimate violation of the addressee's authority as free and rational, on the other.

Consider, for example, an order delivered by a superior to an inferior within a military chain of command. If a sergeant orders a private to do ten pushups, she addresses a reason to him that presupposes her authority to give the order and the private's obligation to obey it. So far, the only relevant normative presupposition is of unequal authority; the sergeant has the standing to give orders to the private, whereas the private has no standing to give orders to the sergeant. But an order doesn't simply point to a reason holding in normative space; it purports to address it second-personally and thereby to hold the addressee responsible for compliance. As second-personal address, an order presupposes that its addressee can freely determine himself through accepting the reasons it addresses and the authority in which they are grounded and hold himself responsible for complying with it. Any second-personal address whatsoever calls for reciprocal recognition of the authority it presupposes (in this case the sergeant's authority). It attempts to direct an addressee's will through the addressee's own free acceptance of that authority.

This ups the ante on the presupposed authority and consequent second-personal reasons, since it requires that the authority be one that the addressee can accept as free and rational. This is what follows when we combine Fichte's Analysis with Pufendorf 's Point from the addressee's perspective. There must be a distinction between the addressee's (the private's) complying with a demand because of a desire to escape some evil, on the one hand, and his complying because he freely accepts the addresser's (second-personal) authority and therefore the addressed second-personal reason, on the other. So although the sergeant, of course, addresses her order to not just any rational person but to the private, there is an important sense in which her addressee must be conceived to be aperson-who-happens-to-be-a-private. Second-personal address is always to a free and rational agent. That is why an order can constitute a summons the taking upof which requires an addressee to posit both himself and his would-be superior as free and rational agents. In presupposing, therefore, that the private can accept her authority, the sergeant cannot simply assume that he can be expected to accept this as a private. Nothing about actually occupying that role can be relevant to whether to accept the norms and authority relations that define it. Rather the sergeant must presuppose that the private can accept the authority she claims as a person, that is, from the (second-person) standpoint they both share as free and rational, and that, as a person, he can accept the specific normative requirements she attempts to place on him for the hypothetical case of occupying the role of private.

In assuming that the private is responsible for complying with the order, the sergeant is committed to thinking that the private would rightly be blamed if he didn't comply without adequate excuse. But reactive attitudes like blame address demands from a perspective they presuppose their addressee can share. So although the sergeant assumes she has a distinctive authority to hold the private accountable, which goes with her special authority to issue the order in the first place, any such specially authorized standing must ultimately be grounded in an authority she must assume that the private shares with her (to hold himself accountable). Otherwise, threatening a sanction, even one he couldn't complain about, would give him a reason of the wrong kind to comply. The reason would not be a second-personal reason to do the pushups whether or not he could escape the sanction, one the acceptance of which is part of holding himself responsible.

So, finally, in making a claim on the private as free and rational in this way, the sergeant must also presuppose a distinction between making a legitimate claim on the private's will in a way that respects his authority as free and rational, on the one hand, and, on the other, attempting illegitimately to direct his will by simply imposing her will on him in some way that "depriv[es him] of [his] ability to act freely" (Fichte 2000: 41), that is, by coercion. However hierarchical, therefore, any address of a second-personal reason also implicitly presupposes a common second-personal authority as free and rational. This is Pufendorf 's Point from the addresser's perspective projected through Fichte's Analysis into the second-person framework in general.

Suppose, for instance, that the sergeant believes that if the private disobeys, she will then be entitled to put him in detention. Seeing what she regards as signs of incipient disobedience, she reminds the private of this fact; she puts him on notice of a sanction that she would be authorized to apply in holding him responsible. In so doing, she necessarily presupposes a distinction between the justified threat of this sanction, which she must suppose to be consistent with the addressee's freely determining himself by the second-personal reasons provided by her order, on the one hand, and attempting unjustifiably to determine him to do the same act by the mere threat of the very same unwanted alternative in which the sanction consists, that is, without the relevant authority, on the other. To use Hart's helpful terms, she must presuppose a distinction between obligating the private by an order and obliging him illegitimately by coercion (1961: 6–8). She must assume that although the private is subject to her orders, it would nonetheless be a violation of his normative standing to attempt to direct his will by threatening the very same evil if she lacked the requisite authority (and other things were held equal). And this commits her to presupposing his authority as a free and rational agent.

Similarly, from the addressee's perspective, if the private is responsible for compliance and being placed in detention by the sergeant is a second-personally justified way of holding him responsible, then the private must accept a distinction between any reason to comply with the order in order to escape the sanction (whether justified or not) and the second-personal reason to comply that the sergeant attempts to give him in issuing her order. Holding himself responsible requires accepting the latter reason and acting on it. If he fails to comply, moreover, then accepting the sanction is not simply acquiescing in something he deserves; it is a way of holding himself responsible, which, again, he can do only from the standpoint that he and the sergeant share as free and rational. So both the sergeant and the private are committed to recognizing their common second-personal competence and second-personal authority.

We come now to Fichte's claim that reciprocal recognition between rational agents commits both parties to the principle of right: "I must in all cases recognize the free being outside me as a free being, i.e., I must limit my freedom through the concept of the possibility of his freedom" (2000: 49). In this abstract form, the principle of right is already implicit in the line of thought we have just traversed. If the argument of this section has been correct so far, then second-personal engagement invariably commits both parties to presupposing that their relations are properly governed by their common standing as rational persons, more specifically, that each will seek to "determine" the other only in ways that are consistent with, and do not undermine, the other's self-determination as a free and rational person. Fichte draws the further consequence that this requires recognizing "spheres of freedom" within which individuals have enforceable rights to do as they will and with respect to which others are required to forbear interference (10, 40–41, 44). If any legitimate interference must be able to be justified to others by second-personal reasons they can themselves accept as rational persons, then this will circumscribe a sphere within which individuals have an enforceable claim to non-interference.26

<sup>26</sup> As I mentioned, Fichte insists that the principle of right is distinct from and independent of the moral law. And he sometimes claims that any obligation imposed by the principle of right must be voluntarily assumed, indeed, assumed individual by individual, through an "arbitrary" positing of the other and simultaneous making of a law not to violate his external freedom (2000: 81). For this reason, Fichte calls the concept of right a "merely technical-practical," rather than moral, concept (10). "The law of right," he asserts, "says nothing to the effect that a particular person should limit his freedom" (14). It simply says what follows from the voluntary self-limiting that is part of positing oneself in opposition to another individual whom one simultaneously recognizes.

On this "voluntarist" interpretation, it takes an individual's voluntary participation in a "reciprocal declaration" to be obligated to (and with respect to) a particular individual

### **An Objection: Slavery**

In the next and final section, I formalize the argument for Fichte's Point that I made informally in the last section. First, however, I want to con-

Other things Fichte says fit no better with a voluntarist interpretation. First, Fichte asserts that agents demand continued recognition of themselves and their freedom "for all the future" when they reciprocally recognize one another (2000: 48). But again, why should this be so on a voluntarist interpretation? It would seem that individuals would be as free voluntarily to obligate themselves for a temporally limited period as to do so indefinitely. However, if, as I have been suggesting, reciprocally recognizing individuals are committed to the second-personal standing of rational persons not as a matter of voluntary agreement but as a presupposition of second-personal address, then such a demand would be expected. A demand for continued recognition from a particular individual "for all the future" would simply be part of a general demand for respect from all persons for all times, a demand to which one is committed as a presupposition of second-person claim making. The situation would be exactly as Kant describes: a rational person "possesses a *dignity* ... by which he exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world" (1996d: 435, emphasis added to "exacts").

Second, Fichte frequently says that reciprocally recognizing agents recognize one another as rational beings and that they are thereby committed to treating one another as rational beings (e.g., 2000: 42, 43). But these claims presuppose that there are ways of (properly) treating and mistreating rational beings as such and, therefore, that failing to recognize a rational being is not just forbearing to make a voluntary commitment one is free not to make. They presuppose that rational being is itself a normative status, that there are ways of respecting or mistreating people just by virtue of their nature as rational, and that, therefore, one is not free not to recognize and respect them. Again, this makes perfect sense on the "presuppositional" interpretation I am proposing. The dignity of rational persons as such, and of the individual before one as a rational person, is what one is committed to as a presupposition of the intelligibility of recognizing him second-personally.

Finally, the most significant problem with the voluntarist interpretation is that unless we assume a background normative relation that obligates agents (to one another) to keep

by the principle of right (2000: 15). I don't believe, however, that Fichte can hold to a voluntarist interpretation if he is to maintain that the conditions for self-awareness are sufficient to validate the principle of right. Fichte sometimes seems to be aware of this, for example, when he says that although one cannot complain that another does one an injury in refusing recognition, nonetheless one can claim that the other "must then remove himself from all human community" (12). (Cf. "[W]hen human beings are to live alongside one another, each must limit his freedom, so that the freedom of others can also exist alongside that freedom" [14].) This suggests that the only way an individual can avoid the obligations imposed by the principle of right is to avoid other people altogether. It is unclear, however, why this should be so on a voluntarist interpretation. Why wouldn't there simply arise various voluntary communities of right, associations within which individuals are obligated by the principle of right, with no obligations of right to outsiders? It is hard to see how a voluntarist interpretation can avoid this consequence.

sider what may seem an obvious objection to the line of thought I have sketched thus far.

their voluntarily made commitments, it is powerless to explain how a voluntary agreement can give rise to any obligation to respect spheres of freedom. (This was the version of Cudworth's Point we encountered before in discussing Gilbert on everyday agreements and Scanlon on promises in Chapter 8.) Fichte clearly assumes that individuals have warranted claims against each other if they violate the other's sphere of freedom once reciprocal recognition has transpired. If I have conformed to the law my co-respondent and I both committed ourselves to in reciprocally recognizing one another, and he subsequently violates that law, then I am in a position to charge him with a violation of my right: "I... appeal to a *law* that is valid for us both, and apply that law to the present case. I thus posit myself as judge, i.e. as his superior.... But, insofar as I appeal to that common law in my opposition to him, I invite him to be a judge along with me; and I demand that in this case he must find my action against him consistent and must approve of it, compelled by the laws of thought" (2000: 47). But what gives the "law" we committed ourselves to normative force? The fact that we committed ourselves to it, as if adopting it together? That could be so only if there exists a further background normative relation that gave us the authority so to bind ourselves voluntarily and whose authority does not itself depend on a voluntary commitment (Cudworth's Point again). My co-respondent and I can be obligated by our "reciprocal declaration" only if we already had the authority to commit ourselves by it, so whether we had that authority cannot itself depend on our voluntary commitment. We must already have had the normative standing to address second-personal reasons, as we presupposed in addressing them to one another.

Suppose, alternatively, that we interpret Fichte as saying that I appeal, not to the fact that my co-respondent and I committed ourselves to the law, but to the law itself to which we then committed ourselves. But this seems to provide no help if my co-respondent now rejects it and refuses to recognize me. Of course, Fichte might argue that he can't simply refuse to recognize me. All I have to do to get him to recognize me is simply to summon him, second-personally, with a charge, remonstrance, or any other address. ("I can compel him to acknowledge that he knows that I am one [a rational being] as well" (2000: 42).) This means, however, that I must be in a position to demand or "exact" respect, just as Kant says, from "all other rational beings in the world," whether they have voluntarily recognized me before or not, simply by summoning them second-personally. And, on reflection, this seems precisely what Fichte should believe. A second-personal summons can be sufficient to give a rational being an awareness of being free and rational agent only if to be a person is to be in a position to exact respect.

Fichte might agree at this point but nonetheless claim that even if it is true that a rational person is always in a position to exact respect from any other, it is the fact of recognition that obligates. At this point, however, the idea that recognition is voluntarily given is seeming substantially less plausible. Moreover, and this is the final important point, recognition of someone as a person seems itself to involve the recognition of a normative standing, a dignity, that it responds to and does not confer. This is Cudworth's Point in another form. Ultimately, therefore, the voluntarist interpretation provides no coherent

When we think about familiar cases of subjection and domination that take an apparently second-personal form, it can seem quite incredible that second-personal address must presuppose anything even remotely like a shared dignity. Surely the argument proves too much. It is one thing to say, for example, that slavery is immoral. It is quite another to say that slavery involves conceptual confusion or some sort of pragmatic contradiction. Something must be wrong, certainly, with any argument that would require us to conclude anything like that.

Nothing I have said, either in Fichte's voice or my own, however, entails that slavery or similar practices are necessarily conceptually confused or pragmatically contradictory. What I have said does imply that the addressing of a demand or order by a slaveholder to a slave, *qua* purporting to be second-personal address, does indeed presuppose that the slaveholder and the slave share a common normative standing as free and rational persons. Unlike subjection or subjugation, any second-personal address seeks reciprocal recognition by its very nature. However, several observations are necessary to avoid misunderstanding on this point, so it will be useful to consider the example of slavery in some detail.27

First, I am not saying that it must be the case that slaveholders actually accept that their slaves have equal standing in any respect. For one thing, even if a slaveholder purports to address a slave second-personally, his address may be inauthentic or insincere. This is like the kind of violation of a speech act's felicity conditions that Austin calls an "abuse" (1964: 18). Even if a slaveholder purports to address a pure second-personal reason to a slave, the most I would claim is that if the slaveholder does not accept that the slave has a normative standing as an equal free and rational person, then he addresses the slave "abusively." His belief conflicts with what the slave is given a claim to expect by the terms of the slaveholder's address, and it is contrary to what would have to be true in order for any second-personal reason to be successfully addressed, hence for any more specific such reason to be addressed to the slave. (Again, my claim in this case, as in others, concerns "normative felicity condi-

alternative to the idea that the reciprocal recognition involved in second-personal address presupposes, rather than somehow creates, the normative standing persons have to address second-personal reasons.

<sup>27</sup> Although my discussion has some resonance with Hegel's famous section on "Lordshipand Bondage" in *The Phenomenology of Sprit* (1977), most of my points are substantially different. I have been helped here by discussion with Matthew Smith.

tions" for the reason's actually existing and being successfully given, not a conventional, Austinian condition of his speech act's constituting an order. The former presupposes authority *de jure,* the latter, only authority *de facto.*)

For a second thing, the slaveholder's approach to the slave may not even purport to be second-personal address in our sense. He may simply be attempting to force the slave's submission or compliance in one way or another that doesn't even purport to address a second-personal reason. To be sure, the most interesting and disturbing cases of domination include second-personal traces or simulacra, such as a humiliating mutual acknowledgment of the slaveholder's power to subjugate the slave.28 But even here, if there is nothing that purports to be authentic second-personal address of the kind we have been concerned with, the argument simply does not apply. As I pointed out in Chapter 6, however, even tyrants like Stalin rarely reject the second-person standpoint outright. To the contrary, they generally manipulate it for their own purposes.

<sup>28</sup> I am indebted to Nir Eyal for the following example. (What follows is, in the main, Eyal's description and analysis.)

In Sergio Leone's *Once Upon a Time in the West,* the malicious villain, played by Henry Fonda, rapes the heroine, played by Claudia Cardinale, with the intention of causing her maximal suffering and humiliation. As the villain leans on topof her, the heroine averts her eyes and looks the other way. The villain grabs her chin and turns it back in order to look her in the eye whilst raping her. The villain does so because a "You are raping me" situation is even more humiliating to the victim than a "He is raping me" situation. And looking one's rape victim in the eye in real time makes the situation into a second-personal in an obvious sense, i.e. a "You are raping me" situation. The reason that a "You are raping me" situation is more humiliating than a "He is raping me" one seems to be that the former situation includes mutual acknowledgment of salient features of the situation, including the humiliation of the victim.

While Eyal's analysis seems clearly correct, the situation does not involve second-personal address in the sense in which we are interested; it does not involve the address of a second-personal reason that presupposes a normative standing. What the rapist forces to be mutually acknowledged seems to be something like "I can do this to you and you can't stop me" or "I can treat you as someone to be raped," not anything normative such as "I am entitled to rape you." This is humiliating subjugation rather than a second-personal address grounded in the addresser's presupposed authority. It is worth noting, however, that only rarely is even attempted subjugation merely a matter of exerting force without at least some fantasy or self-narrative of authority. On this point, see my discussion in Chapters 4 and 6.

And for a third thing, even if the terms of second-personal address commit a master addressing claims to his slaves to presuppose their second-personal authority, that does not mean that he presupposes it in fact.

Second, I am not saying that if a slaveholder claims to the world at large that he has authority over his slaves, this commits him to recognizing his slaves' dignity either. In this case, he addresses his claim not to his slaves but to others, and whereas my argument would then require us to conclude that he must presuppose their dignity, it would not entail that he must presuppose that of his slaves. He might simply be claiming that his slaves are his property, like his cattle, and that he therefore has, within certain limits, rights to do with them as he will, which claims his addressees must accept. Such a claim would clearly not commit him to his slaves' dignity as persons any more than he would be committed to any such doctrine with respect to his cattle. My claim is rather that if he purports to address a second-personal reason based on this claim to his slaves, then this second-personal address would commit him to the presupposition that he and they share an equal (second-personal) standing just as free and rational persons.29

Third, even if this were true, it still wouldn't follow that any purported second-personal address to a slave as a slave, that is, as having a normative status that is (as we believe) incompatible with being a free and rational person, must be conceptually confused or pragmatically selfcontradictory. Indeed, it doesn't *follow* that it must be unsupported or false. After all, there are many forms of unequal authority that we believe to be quite consistent with the equal dignity of rational persons as such. Imagine a sergeant in a citizen army that a fully just society of equals maintains entirely for defensive purposes. In issuing an order to a private, the sergeant addresses a second-personal reason based on relations of superior authority she can quite reasonably expect the private to accept and be guided by from the perspective of one free and equal person among others.

Now we, of course, may believe that a condition of involuntary servitude cannot be endorsed rationally for any conditions, but it is surely possible for someone to believe otherwise. For example, someone might

<sup>29</sup> Of course, many things we call "orders," for example, "Heel" said to a cocker spaniel, do not necessarily involve the purported address of a second-personal reason in the sense we have been interested in.

believe, without any obvious incoherence, that such a practice could be justified for the case of imprisoned soldiers of a defeated army of conquest. Indeed, it seems possible for a slaveholder in the antebellum South coherently to have believed, however mistakenly or unjustifiably, that his slaves could be expected rationally to endorse his claim to authority over them. After all, he might have thought, he had rightfully acquired them in accordance with procedures that could be rationally endorsed, from a perspective of freedom and equality, by anyone! He had bought their "contract" in something like the way baseball teams did before the abolition of the "reserve clause" in major-league baseball. (Never mind that the slaves did not consent to their enslavement in the first place.) All this seems absurd to us because it seems obvious that these putative normative relations simply cannot be rationally endorsed from the perspective of one free and rational person among others. But if someone were to believe otherwise, she might think it possible for the equal dignity that a slaveholder's second-personal address implicitly presupposes to be consistent with the superior authority that the slaveholder would explicitly claim in something like the way a sergeant in a just society can explicitly claim authority to command a private whom she must implicitly presuppose to have the same dignity as a free and equal rational person that she does.

It is, consequently, no objection to the argument of this chapter that the argument would entail that practices like slavery are impossible, necessarily conceptually confused, or pragmatically self-contradictory. The argument does not have these consequences or presuppositions.30 In fact, I am not even here claiming that slavery is immoral. Although I certainly endorse that substantive normative thesis, my argument in this chapter does not depend on it. My claim, again, is only that any address of a second-personal reason, including any from a master to a slave, is committed to the presupposition that addresser and addressee share an equal normative standing as free and rational persons.

<sup>30</sup> Many slaveholders likely tried to have it both ways, rationalizing their slaves' subjugation by fantasies of a superior authority their slaves could rationally accept that they themselves could not possibly have accepted on reflection. For a fascinating discussion of the ways in which thinking through the legal standing of slaves revealed presuppositional contradictions in antebellum slavery, see Oakes 1990. Oakes discusses a North Carolina Supreme Court Case, *State v. Will,* that found that "there were not only limits to the master's authority but that the slave had a right to resist the master who stepped beyond these limits (161). I am indebted to Elizabeth Anderson for this reference.

### **Formulating the Argument**

We are now in a position to lay out the argument more formally, continuing to bear in mind that the premises all concern second-personal address as such.

1. *Addressing second-personal reasons always presupposes that addressees can freely and rationally determine themselves by the addressed reasons.* This follows directly from Fichte's Analysis. To address a second-personal reason of any kind is to attempt to direct an agent's will through her own free self-determining choices. That is why the issuing and taking upof any second-personal summons whatsoever requires both addresser and addressee to deliberate on the assumption that both are free and rational. Both must assume that both have the capacity to determine themselves by the relevant second-personal reasons.

2. *Addressing second-personal demands or claims always presupposes that the addressee is responsible for compliance.* Accountability of some kind is built into the very idea of a demand or claim, and vice versa (Strawson's Point). The concepts of valid claim or demand, second-personal reason, and responsibility (accountability) all share the same irreducible idea of the authority to claim or demand. If *A* has the standing to demand certain conduct from *B,* then *B* not only thereby has a reason to do what *A* demands; *B* also has a responsibility, including to *A,* such that if *B* does not freely comply, *A* may hold *B* responsible in some way. Exactly what way will vary with the case. *B* may be responsible only for giving some account of his failure to comply, that is, for justifying himself to *A.* Or various reactive attitudes or even legal coercive sanctions may be appropriate. But in any case, it is part of the very idea of *A*'s making a valid demand of *B* that *A* has the authority to relate to *B* in "demanding" ways that: (1) *B* might not want or choose, (2) *A* thereby has justification for, whether or not *B* wants or chooses, and (3) *A* would not have justification for without the relevant authority.

3. *Addressing second-personal reasons always presupposes that addressees can rationally accept these reasons (and the authority relations in which they are grounded). Thus, although second-personal reasons are frequently addressed to someone standing in some more specific normative relation, the addressee is more properly conceived of as a-person-who-happens-to-standin-that-normative-relation. Second-personal justification is thus always ultimately justification to another as free and rational.* Here there are two points. The first, which is that second-personal address presupposes that the addressee can rationally accept the addressed reasons and the authority relations in which they are grounded, follows from premise 1. The only way an agent can freely and rationally determine himself by a reason is by rationally accepting and acting on it. And the only way an agent can accept a second-personal reason is by accepting the authority relations in which it is grounded.

The second point is that the addresser must also presuppose that the addressee can be expected to accept these things as a free and rational person and, therefore, that although second-personal reasons frequently invoke more specific normative relations, the reason is more properly conceived of as addressed to a-person-who-happens-to-stand-in-thatputatively-normative-relation. It is not enough for the sergeant to presuppose that the private she addresses actually accepts her authority. The private cannot freely and rationally determine himself by the reason the sergeant purports to give him unless he rationally accepts it. And that he is himself a private, or that he actually accepts the sergeant's authority over him, is irrelevant to whether he can accept this role rationally. That depends, rather, on whether, as a rational person, he should accept this normative relation in general and, as a consequence, accept the sergeant's authority should he occupy, as he does, the position of private.

It is important that premise 3 concerns second-personal reasons in particular. Whether or not practical reasons are subject to any test of rational acceptance or motivation in general,31 there are special reasons for thinking that second-personal reasons must be owing to the relation between second-personal address and accountability. We have noted before Gary Watson's point that holding someone morally responsible carries such presuppositions as constraints of "moral address" (1987: 264– 265). But Fichte's Analysis shows that there is no relevant difference in this respect between moral address and second-personal address in general. Any second-personal address whatsoever purports to initiate a relation in which an addressee is accountable to an addresser. And the lesson of Fichte's Analysis is that second-personal reasons are always ultimately addressed to agents as free and rational. So an addresser can intelligibly hold an addressee accountable for acting as a second-personal address directs only if she can presuppose that her addressee can ration-

<sup>31</sup> That is, whether "existence internalism" is true (Darwall 1983: 54–55).

ally accept the reason and determine himself by it in his own deliberation. Even though second-personal reasons frequently invoke more specific normative relations, therefore, they are always ultimately addressed to a-person-who-happens-to-stand-in-that-specific-putatively-normativerelation. And whether that specific relation actually is normative for the addressee, whether it is one whose specifications he is genuinely responsible for complying with, depends on whether he can accept it as a rational person, that is, from a perspective that he and his addressee share as free and rational.

When we address second-personal reasons and hold addressees accountable for complying, we are committed to the presupposition that they are appropriate objects of reactive attitudes, therefore blameworthy, when they fail to comply without excuse. But even when reactive attitudes involve some distinctive person's perspective (that of an injured party, as in resentment, or the perspective of the wrongdoer, as in guilt), they always also involve the generalized or impartial perspective of any person with second-personal competence. Blame, in particular, is felt not as from some particular point of view; rather, it implicitly addresses demands as from the perspective of any free and rational person. So in addressing any demand and holding an addressee responsible, the addresser is committed to an authority he has in common with his addressee to address demands in blaming and holding responsible simply as a person with second-personal competence.

We have sometimes put a corollary of this last point by saying that to hold someone responsible for complying with a demand is to be committed to the presupposition that the addressee of our demand can hold herself responsible for complying with it. To do this she must be able to make the demand of herself from the perspective that she and we can share: the generalized perspective of second-personally competent persons. In presupposing she can do this, therefore, the addresser is committed to the authority of this perspective.

<sup>4</sup> *Addressing a demand always presupposes a distinction between legitimate (second-personally justified) ways of relating to someone directively ("demandingly") that respect him as a free and rational person, on the one hand, and illegitimately coercing him, on the other.* The last two paragraphs of commentary on premise 3 already asserted that second-personal address invariably commits us to a common authority of addresser and addressee alike, as second-personally competent, to hold themselves and one another responsible for complying with whatever demands can be authorized from this perspective. This is already a significant result. But for it to have real teeth, we need that second-personal address is in general committed to there being some such latter demands (and hence, by the argument in 3, to second-personally competent agents having the authority to hold one another responsible for complying with these).

This is what premise 4 gives us. In making or holding anyone responsible for complying with a demand of any sort, we are invariably committed to a distinction between relating to that person directively ("demandingly") in a way that nonetheless respects him as a free and rational person, on the one hand, and treating him simply coercively, that is illegitimately coercing him, and so failing to respect him as a free and rational person, on the other. This, again, is Pufendorf 's Point from the addresser's perspective projected into general second-personal space (as a consequence of Fichte's Analysis). Holding someone responsible with reactive attitudes, as Strawson emphasizes, simultaneously makes demands of the other as second-personally competent and respects him in recognizing his having an authority in having this competence (1968: 93). And this commits us to the proposition that relating to someone in a demanding way (even if only by making someone the object of a reactive attitude) requires warrant by the requisite second-personal reasons, that is, that simply demanding conduct or attempting to coerce it from someone is illegitimate, a violation of the other's authority as second-personally competent.32 *It follows that one demand that anyone has the authority to make is that he not be subject to demanding (coercive) conduct that cannot be justified by second-personal reasons.*33

Call any form of relating to someone that one has standing to realize toward him by virtue of his failure to comply with a justified demand, whether or not he wants or chooses, a "sanction."34 Then, by definition, the address of any second-personal reason will presuppose the standing

<sup>32</sup> I have been helped in this paragraph by Jacob Ross.

<sup>33</sup> Note the similarity between this and Fichte's principle of right: "I must in all cases recognize the free being outside me as a free being, i.e., I must limit my freedom through the concept of the possibility of his freedom" (2000: 49).

<sup>34</sup> Although I pursue the argument here in terms of sanctions, it could as well be put in terms of the initial demand, which an addresser must also assume is a properly authorized way of relating to another "demandingly" that would be illegitimate without the requisite authority.

to exact sanctions should the addressee fail to comply. We have from Fichte's Analysis that any such address is ultimately to another as a free and rational person. It follows that the addresser is committed to a distinction between making a legitimate demand on someone's conduct (including with the notice of sanctions for unexcused noncompliance) in a way that (rightfully) recognizes the addressee as a free and rational person, on the one hand, and attempting illegitimately to determine his will by a mere threat of the unwanted alternative in which the sanction consists (that is, by coercion, which notice of the sanctions would be if she lacked the relevant authority), or to impose her will by some other illegitimate means, on the other.35

Now it might be thought that even if, say, the sergeant of our example would be committed to thinking that without authority her demands and sanctions would lack legitimacy, it would not follow that they would then be illegitimate in the sense of violating the private's authority.36 She might think that, even if she were to lack a (Hohfeldian claim-) right to sanction the private, which would entail a corresponding duty of the private not to resist, she would nonetheless have a (Hohfeldian) liberty to impose her will on him, including by threatening the very same evils in which, as thing actually stand, her justified sanction consists.37 But this is not a possibility she can contemplate from a second-person perspective for all but one of the reasons we mentioned in the last paragraph. In holding the private responsible at all, she is committed to respecting his authority as second-personally competent. She is committed, therefore, to thinking that any second-personal authority at all, which itself partly is a standing to hold free and rational agents responsible, must be complemented by

<sup>35</sup> Alternatively, the initial demand presupposes a distinction between addressing the demand in a way that respects the addressee's authority (because it is justified second-personally) and trying to get him to do it by simply demanding that he do it, which would be illegitimate and disrespectful.

<sup>36</sup> I am indebted to Gerald Gaus and to Eric Mack for raising this concern. The argument in the text to this point recalls Hart's "to assert a general right is to claim in relation to some particular action the equal right of all men to be free in the absence of any of those special conditions which constitute a special right to limit another's freedom; to assert a special right is to assert in relation to some particular action a right constituted by such special conditions to restrict another's freedom" (1955: 188). The objection I consider in this paragraph is one that Mack (1976) raises against Hart.

<sup>37</sup> Alternatively, perhaps it would simply violate someone else's authority. I am indebted here to Ira Lindsay. What follows responds also to this possibility.

a second-personal authority that anyone can have just in being second-personally competent.

We can get the conclusion that anyone has the authority to demand that she not be subjected to non-second-personally-justifiable demands more directly from premise 3 as follows: Any second-personal authority at all can exist only if it can be rationally accepted by free and rational agents as such. But for that to be true there must be grounds for such an acceptance, and whatever interests free and rational agents have as such would have to be among such grounds. It is conceptually necessary, moreover, that free and rational agents have an interest in not being subject to others' arbitrary will since that would, by definition, interfere with the exercise of their free and rational agency. As this interest must be among the grounds that free and rational agents have for accepting any authoritative demands at all, it necessarily supports a demand, as free and rational, against being subject to demands that cannot be so justified. It follows, again, that second-personally competent agents have the authority to demand that they not be subject to mere impositions of will, that is, to demanding (coercive) conduct that cannot be justified second-personally.

<sup>5</sup> *Addressing second-personal demands always presupposes, therefore, that the addressee has a second-personal authority as free and rational and, consequently, that addresser and addressee share a common authority to make claims on one another.* In presupposing that coercing or simply imposing her will on her addressee would be illegitimate, an addresser must therefore presuppose that this would violate her addressee's authority as a free and rational person. So any address of second-personal reasons must presuppose that addresser and addressee share a (second-personal) authority to make demands of one another as free and rational persons.

It is important to see that not just any distinction between appropriate and inappropriate conduct toward someone as rational commits one to shared second-personal authority. Someone might undertake a kind of rational therapy or training, applying "sanctions" as a corrective when someone fails to act rationally. This would commit a rational trainer to some distinction between appropriate and inappropriate "correction" of the other as rational, but it wouldn't be the distinction I am pointing to here, and so it wouldn't commit him to recognizing that the other has a second-personal authority.38 Similarly, Plato's argument against Thrasy-

<sup>38</sup> I am indebted here to discussion with Shelly Kagan.

machus in the *Republic* that there must be a distinction between correct and incorrect rule in the sense of proper versus improper care of the governed does not entail such authority either, any more than a gardener must assume that her vegetables have any claim against her if she tends them poorly. It is the assumption of legitimate authority understood as the standing to address second-personal reasons that generates this presupposition.

<sup>6</sup> *Addressing second-personal reasons always, therefore, presupposes a common basic dignity of persons.* If, as I suggest, we understand the dignity of persons to consist or be grounded in the second-personal authority of rational and free (second-personally) competent agents, then this follows by definition from premise 5 (assuming, of course, the "forensic" character of the concept of person as involving accountability (second-person competence)) (Locke 1975: 346).

<sup>7</sup> *Addressing second-personal reasons always presupposes autonomy of the will (second-personal competence).* Taking premises 3 and 5 (or 6) together, we have that any second-personal address whatsoever presupposes an addressee's capacity to accept and act on reasons that are grounded, ultimately, in an authority that addresser and addressee share as free and rational. We are now back in the same terrain we traversed when we analyzed Kant's "fact of reason" in second-personal terms. When we hold people responsible, we imply that they have it within them to act as they should, not just in the sense that the obligatory alternative was deliberatively open to them, or that they weren't physically prevented, but also that they had a process of reasoning available to them through which they could, in principle, have determined the validity of relevant second-personal reasons and been motivated to act on them. Since second-personal reasons are not outcome-regarding, we need therefore attribute no particular (object-dependent) desires to those we aim to hold accountable. But we must assume that they have access to a source of reasons simply in being rational wills who are apt for second-personal address, hence, a source that is "independent of any features of the objects of volition." It follows that we must assume autonomy of the will, that is, that the will can be "a law to itself" independently of object-dependent desires or any outcome-value of their objects. As I argued at the end of Chapter 9, this is the most promising line of support for Kant's claim that the validity of the CI (a "formal" rather than "material" principle [Kant 1996b: 19–31]) is a necessary condition for the possibility of moral obligation.

Second-personal competence, moreover, is what autonomy of the will must be if we are accountable to one another simply as rational agents who are apt for second-personal address. The requisite process of reasoning must itself be one that expresses, and enables us to specify, respect for the common second-personal authority we presuppose whenever we address second-personal reasons and hold one another accountable. Chapter 12 argues that what can fill this role is contractualist reasoning interpreted through Kant's idea of the "Realm of Ends"—in our terms, a pattern of reasoning that is grounded in the common (second-personal) authority that all second-personally competent agents share. Roughly, we hold ourselves morally accountable to others when we impose demands on ourselves that we think it sensible to impose on anyone from a perspective that we can all share as free (second-personally competent) and rational. And we presuppose that anyone we hold thus accountable is someone who can in principle also accept and impose these same demands on himself by taking up this impartial second-person perspective and seeing the sense of imposing them on anyone.39

<sup>39</sup> We might, as I mentioned before, see the relevant impartial perspective as one we share and that demands made from that standpoint are ones we make as the moral community in the first-personal plural. As I also emphasized, however, the perspective is no less second-personal for that, since it essentially involves address.

## 11. Freedom and Practical Reason

The last chapter argued that the dignity of persons and autonomy of the will not only entail one another as the Reciprocity Thesis asserts, but also that they are presupposed by the second-person standpoint. Both are transcendental conditions for the very possibility of second-personal reasons (or "normative felicity conditions," as I have called them). So we must presuppose them when we address second-personal reasons of any kind.

Even if this argument succeeds in its own terms, however, it might seem to have only limited vindicatory force, since it appears just to widen the circle of reciprocity. What can assure us that the notion of a second-personal reason and its companion ideas of valid demand, accountability, and the authority to claim and demand are not all themselves empty? Even if taking up the second-person stance commits us to equal dignity and autonomy, that is consistent with that standpoint and its associated commitments being no more than rationally optional, or worse, illusory.

In this chapter, I respond to this challenge by placing second-personal reasons within a more comprehensive understanding of practical reason and our freedom as rational agents. Developing Fichte's insights, I argue that the second-person standpoint gives us a perspective on our own agency that enables us to appreciate a fundamental difference between theoretical and practical reason and so improves our grasp of reasons for acting. Were someone somehow to avoid taking it up, consequently, she would fail to appreciate what we, who have taken it up, can validate as reasons from a more comprehensive view that includes it.

Before I begin to lay out this line of thought, however, we should note that there is no obvious way simply to refuse to see things second-personally. The force of Strawson's original arguments in "Freedom and

277

Resentment" partly derives from the fact that reactive attitudes, along with their second-personal presuppositions, are aspects of the human condition that are not optional in any realistic psychological sense. Recognizable human life without second-personal thought and experience is simply unimaginable, as the example of Stalin helps confirm as an extreme case.1 In itself, however, this has only limited philosophical significance. The philosophical question is whether we should see things in this way. As Hume noted in another context, that we find ourselves naturally taking up this perspective when we leave our studies does not settle the reflective philosophical question we raise within them (1978: 455). And after all, the capacity for philosophical reflection is no less distinctively human than is the disposition to reactive attitudes.

Or again, a Fichtean summons from another free and rational agent will usually be enough to set us to thinking second-personally, if only in considering how to respond.2 But even if we can't avoid such acknowledgment and its accompanying presuppositions when we take up a summons, we can step back from these and ask whether, on reflection, we should still accept them. And nothing suggests that fundamental philosophical reflection on practical reason must be second-personal itself.

All the same, it is worth noting that even though the argument of the last chapter amounts to a reciprocity thesis, it is a significantly wider one than that concerning morality and autonomy of the will. So the argument of the preceding chapter may have significant vindicatory force even without the argument of this one. There have been serious philosophical critiques of the "morality system" and principle- or obligation-based conceptions of morality, not to mention rejection of moral obligations' claim to provide universal categorical reasons, but there has been little if any attempt to reject or question the whole range of second-personal concepts we have identified.3

<sup>1</sup> See the discussion of Stalin in Chapter 6. Compare Scheffler's remark about the attempt to regiment reactive attitudes along consequentialist lines: "[T]he idea that it would be wrong for the innocent woman and her associates to resent the man for harming her in order to make optimal use of his causal opportunities, but appropriate for them to resent or be indignant with him for not harming her, seems psychologically and humanly absurd" (2004: 230).

<sup>2</sup> Cf. Korsgaard: "It is impossible to hear words of a language you know as mere noise. In hearing your words as *words,* I acknowledge that you are someone" (1996e: 143).

<sup>3</sup> Thus, we should note that one of the most influential critics of the "morality system," Bernard Williams—who coined the phrase "morality system" itself in *Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy*—nonetheless defends the idea of "basic human rights" (1985: 192). For an earlier important criticism of law-based moral conceptions, see Anscombe 1958. See also Slote 1992 and Baier 1993. The classic critique of the claim that moral obligations are categorical is Foot 1972.

### **Normativity and the Open Question: Belief and Truth**

In this chapter, I deepen and extend the contrast between theoretical and practical reason that I began to develop in the last two chapters. I take it to be uncontroversial that the question of practical reason is what we have reason to do and that that of theoretical reason is what we have reason to believe. Using Velleman's terms, we can say that the "formal aim" of action is to do whatever there is (normative) reason to do and that the formal aim of belief is to believe whatever there is reason to believe.4 These formal aims are explicitly normative (as, indeed, any such formal aim would have to be). Equivalently, we could say that the formal aims of belief and action are, respectively, to believe and act as we should, as is warranted, as would be apt or correct, as is best supported by normative reasons (and so, in this sense, as is best), and so on.

In addition to its formal aim, Velleman says that belief also has a "substantive aim": to believe (only) what is true. What makes truth, or believing only truths, a substantive aim of belief is that satisfying it is conceptually distinguishable from satisfying belief 's (explicitly normative) formal aim: being what one should believe, or being warranted, apt, or correct (to believe). "What should I believe?" is a different question from "What is true?"

Trivially, we should believe whatever we should believe, whatever would satisfy belief 's formal aim, just as, trivially, we should do whatever we should do, hence whatever would satisfy action's formal aim. But with belief we can say something more substantive owing to the nature of belief. Belief is the mental state of representing the way things are with the aim of getting it right, that is, aiming to represent things as they actually are or to believe only truths. Consequently, that we should believe only what is true (or what is likeliest to be true relative to our evidence) follows from the nature of belief. True beliefs are correct, where being correct is conceptually distinct from being true. If someone makes a counterfactual supposition just to see what would follow from it, it is a

<sup>4</sup> Velleman 2000. I am much indebted to Velleman's work on the aim of belief in what follows.

bad joke to say that his supposition is mistaken or incorrect. False beliefs, like false answers, are mistaken or incorrect, however.

The notions of normative reason for belief or action, or of a belief 's or action's being correct, warranted, apt, appropriate, fitting, and so on, are all normative concepts. Moore's "open question" argument is often taken to be a useful test of whether a concept is normative or not (1993: 67).5 So long as we bear in mind that we cannot infer identity or distinctness of properties, and, as well, that our grasp on a concept may be imperfect in various ways, we can take the fact that certain questions seem conceptually open as an indication that distinct concepts are in play (Railton 1989: 158). For example, if a philosopher uses 'good' as a synonym for 'pleasure', we can take the fact that it seems possible to ask, without conceptual confusion, "I grant that the experience would be pleasurable, but is that any reason to bring it about, desire, or have any other particular attitude toward it?" as showing that 'good', as this philosopher is using it, does not express a normative concept. By the same token, however, we must be careful not to conclude too quickly from the fact that a question of apparently the right form is logically closed that the relevant concept is a normative one. Thus, from the fact that it is not logically open to ask without conceptual confusion, "I grant that *p* is true, but is there any reason to believe *p?*" it would be a mistake to conclude that truth is a normative concept or, even more, to conclude that a '*p* is true' means the same as '*p* is something one should believe.' What closes the question is not that these have the same meaning, but what we noted above about the concept of belief. We simply don't count a way of representing or regarding *p* as true as a belief that *p,* unless it is a species of representing or regarding with the aim of so representing *p* only if *p.* For example, supposing that *p* differs from believing that *p* for this very reason.

### **Normativity and the Open Question: Action, Desire, and Outcome Value**

We get leverage on the formal question of what there is reason to believe by directly considering what is true, or what is likeliest to be true given

<sup>5</sup> On this point, see Darwall, Gibbard, and Railton 1997: 3–4.

our evidence.6 Consider, then, a picture of the theoretical standpoint that is analogous to that of the naïve practical standpoint that we briefly discussed in the last two chapters. Experience purports to be of an independent order of fact and involves inclinations to beliefs that putatively represent that order. As we gain more experience, we correct our representations with the aim of representing things more accurately, believing only what is true. What makes it possible for experiences to confirm or conflict with one another is their objective purport. I see what seems to be a straight stick lying on the bank of a pond and notice that, when it is placed in the pond, it looks bent. Perhaps I initially believe that it is bent. But as I gain more experience with sticks and ponds, I come to the conclusion that sticks retain their straightness in ponds; they only look bent.

On this picture, the rational formation of beliefs about an independent order of fact like the empirical world is guided by responsiveness to that order, that is, to states of the world as they actually are. There is, of course, no such thing as pure responsiveness in experience—that is the "myth of the given" (Sellars 1997). Any experience that can bear on what to believe must already be conceptualized and taken within some theoretical framework. By the same token, however, unless the formation of beliefs about independent facts involved an element of receptivity (in empirical belief, responsiveness to the world as it actually is), it would be hard to see how belief formation, at least about the world, could proceed rationally.

This is just another form of a point we encountered in Chapter 9, namely, that although there are varieties of freedom, negative and positive, which even a theoretical reasoner must presuppose, nothing analogous to Kantian autonomy of the will seems to be among them. When it comes to forming beliefs about independent facts, reasons for belief cannot be found independently of properties of the objects of belief. To the contrary, rational beliefs of this kind must be guided by the very world that provides their objects. They must be object-guided and thus object-dependent.7

<sup>6</sup> Evidence is a relation between propositions. Evidence that *p* (is true), provides reason to believe that *p* (is true).

<sup>7</sup> This doesn't mean that they must not also be to some degree principle-dependent, but given the substantive aim of belief they can hardly be principle-dependent in the way autonomy of the will requires.

Now, in practical reason, the question is not what to believe but what to do. Nevertheless, there is a way of thinking of the practical standpoint, what I have been calling the naïve (first-person) practical standpoint, according to which it is formally analogous to the standpoint of theoretical reason as we have just pictured it. This, again, is the way that Moore conceives of practical reasoning in *Principia Ethica.* According to Moore in *Principia,* there is a single fundamental ethical concept, the concept of good or intrinsic value, or, as Moore also puts it, of something's being such as "ought to exist for its own sake" (1993: 34). So far as this concept goes, anything whatsoever might instantiate it: experiences, objects, relations, states of affairs, or, indeed, actions. Something has intrinsic value in this sense if, and only if, it ought to exist or, as we might alternatively formulate it, if the state of its existing ought to be.

What suits Moore's conception of intrinsic value to the naïve practical standpoint is that it provides a conception of the value of possible states of the world and hence of the value of outcomes. But this means that it also provides a way of seeing action as having, like belief, a substantive aim. Whereas belief 's substantive aim is to represent the world as it actually is, action's substantive aim, on this Moorean picture, would be to bring about intrinsically valuable outcomes—the world as it ought to be, so far as this is feasible.

Actually, in *Principia,* Moore's position is that bringing about intrinsically valuable outcomes is action's formal aim, since he there maintains that the concept of being what one should do is definable in terms of the concept of intrinsic value and empirical causal concepts concerning the outcomes of possible actions. To assert that a given act is what one should do, Moore says, "is obviously to assert that more good or less evil will exist in the world, if it be adopted than if anything else be done instead" (77).8 This claims an identity of meaning between "what one should do" (alternatively, "what action is best supported by normative reasons," "what is the correct, most warranted, or best act, etc."), on the one hand, and, on the other, "which action is the one, of those available to the agent, that would produce the most intrinsic value." And it characterizes action's formal aim in explicitly instrumental terms. Even if an act has intrinsic value just in virtue of the kind of act it is, Moore believes, the

<sup>8</sup> Moore formulates this in terms of what is "absolutely right or obligatory," but it is clear enough that this is what he has in mind.

concept of the act's being what one should do, all things considered, is nonetheless identical with the concept of its having the most instrumental value of any act available to the agent (where that instrumental value might include its "bringing about" the intrinsically valuable state of the act's being performed).

Intrinsic value for Moore is value as an existent: "When we assert that a thing is good, what we mean is that its existence or reality is good" (1993: 171). The idea that an act is intrinsically valuable, therefore, is that its existence or reality is good.9 Moore takes this to imply that the concept of there being a reason to perform the act is the same idea as its being the case that, if the act is performed, the world will then contain something that is intrinsically valuable as an existent; a state of the world will be brought about that ought to be simply by virtue of what it is (or would be). It is no exaggeration therefore to say that this understanding of reasons for action identifies them with action's instrumental value its capacity to produce intrinsically valuable outcomes, including, perhaps, the outcome of the act itself being performed. The concept of an action's value as an action is thus identified with that of the act's capacity to produce things with intrinsic value as existents (including, perhaps, the act itself), outcomes that ought to be just by virtue of what they are.

Thus in *Principia,* Moore held that the formal aim of action is to produce intrinsically valuable outcomes. In this, however, Moore was clearly mistaken, as he himself gave us the conceptual tool to see: the open question argument. We can suppose it to be a fact that a given action will produce the most valuable outcomes and still sensibly, that is, coherently, ask whether one should perform that act (alternatively, whether it is the act best supported by normative reasons, the best act, and so on).10 Identifying the formal aim of action with its capacity to produce intrinsically valuable outcomes thus fails the open question test.11 Similarly, one can deny that an act with the most intrinsically valuable outcomes is what one should do without self-contradiction or conceptual confusion. So the Moore of *Principia* to the contrary notwithstanding,

<sup>9</sup> On this point, see Moore 1993: 197. I discuss what Moore says there in Darwall 2003b.

<sup>10</sup> I hope this will strike the reader at this point as understatement. Otherwise the claim that any second-personal reasons exist would be not just false but incoherent!

<sup>11</sup> As W. D. Ross noted (1930: 8–9).

action's formal aim cannot be identified with the bringing about of intrinsically valuable outcomes.

But this opens up the possibility that bringing about intrinsically valuable outcomes might nonetheless be action's substantive aim. Perhaps, that is, just as accurately representing the world as it actually is is belief 's substantive aim, so analogously might action have the substantive aim of bringing about the world as it ought to be, subject to constraints of feasibility. Moreover, as I have been suggesting over the last two chapters, this will indeed seem a plausible thing to think if we consider action from the naïve (first-person) practical standpoint of an agent with desires deliberating about what to do.

Desires, like beliefs, involve representations. Just as a belief is always a belief that *p,* for some *p,* so also, on a familiar philosophical picture, at least, is a desire always a desire that *p,* for some *p.*12 If, for example, I want a chocolate ice cream cone, what I want is that I eat such a cone. But belief and desire differ in their directions of fit. Beliefs have the mindto-world direction of fit—they are correct when they fit the world; however, desires have the world-to-mind direction of fit—from their perspective, at least, the world is "correct," as it should be, when it fits them (Anscombe 1957; Platts 1979: 256–257; Smith 1994: 111–119).

Care is required, however, in interpreting this familiar idea. We should not take it to mean that desires dictate to the world in the sense that a desire that *p* somehow makes it the case that *p* has value or ought to obtain. That would be getting normative reasons on the cheap, deriving an ethical 'ought' from a psychological 'is'; and it would fail also to appreciate the "backgrounding" of desire from the agent's point of view (Darwall 1983; Pettit and Smith 1990). The point is rather that in desiring that *p,* an agent regards *p* as valuable, as a state of the world that ought to be.13 She takes it that there is normative reason to bring *p* about.

<sup>12</sup> Although I make use of this familiar picture of desire here, I think there are good reasons for being suspicious of it, some of which I discuss in Darwall 2002b: 47–49, 92– 94. First, benevolent desires have not just a propositional "direct object" but also an "indirect object": the being for whose sake the (beneficial) state of affairs is desired. Second, there are many desires for objects (e.g., to engage in a certain activity) that cannot adequately be characterized as desires for a state in which one engages in that activity.

<sup>13</sup> More carefully, we should say that in desiring that *p,* it seems, or it is to the agent as if, *p* is valuable or a state that ought to be. One can, of course, desire that *p* and judge there is no reason whatsoever to bring *p* about, just as one can have an experience that is as of a bent stick in a pond and judge that there is no reason to think that the stick is really bent. I discuss these points at greater length in Darwall 2001.

From the naïve practical standpoint, therefore, an agent will take herself to have normative reasons to bring about the objects of her desires not because her desires create or are a source of reasons but because in desiring these objects, she sees them as states she has reason to bring about. From this perspective, the agent looks, as it were, through her desires and agency to how the world might better be and to what she can do to bring this about. Her desires seem to provide a form of "practical experience" that is analogous to experience of the world as this operates in reasoning about what to believe about the world as it actually is.14 They present themselves as a form of epistemic access to the intrinsic value of the states that are their objects, and hence, to normative reasons for bringing these states about. They will not seem the only form of access; neither will they seem incorrigible. Being pleased that *p* also involves seeing *p* as something good or as a state that ought to be.15 And since pleasure differs from desire precisely in the fact that pleasure's objects are conceived to obtain in fact and desire's are conceived not as actual but only as possible, pleasure may seem to provide more credible evidence that its object is valuable and ought to be.

Thus, just as a theoretical reasoner takes his experiences as evidence of the way the world actually is and attempts by comparing and extending his experiences in various ways to come to beliefs that are likeliest to satisfy belief 's substantive aim, so likewise does a naïve practical reasoner treat her practical experiences, her desires and other like responses, as evidence of what possible states of the world would be intrinsically good, hence, of how the world should be. And in so doing, she effectively treats action as having a substantive aim—bringing about the world as it should be—that is analogous to belief 's: representing the world as it actually is.

Now if the idea of intrinsic value is itself a normative notion, it may seem puzzling that it could figure in a substantive rather than a formal aim. However, we saw above why bringing about valuable outcomes cannot be the formal aim of action. The concept of an act one ought to do is a distinct concept from that of an act that would bring about the most valuable outcomes, that is, possible states of the world that ought to be, or even from the concept of an act's being the sole constituent of a state of the world that ought to be. We need not worry about whether intrinsic value is an explicitly normative concept or, if it is, precisely what

<sup>14</sup> For a defense of this conception of desire, see Stampe 1987.

<sup>15</sup> As Sidgwick's view of pleasure (1967) brings out. For a discussion of Sidgwick's ethics along the lines presented in this paragraph, see Darwall 1974.

sort of normativity it has.16 It is enough for our purposes that, whatever normativity it might have, the proposition that an act would bring about the most valuable outcomes is neither identical with nor entails the proposition that the agent should perform the act (all things considered). Whether or not any form of consequentialism is true as a normative thesis, it is certainly not a conceptual truth.17

Moore says in *Principia* that, if something has intrinsic value, it "ought to exist for its own sake." It is hard to see how to take such "ought to exist" or "ought to be" claims literally, since it would seem that only what can be normatively guided can be subject to oughts, and neither mere existence nor being are capable of that. The most natural way of interpreting such claims is to understand them as asserting that certain valuing attitudes, namely, the one we have toward possible states of affairs, are warranted, say, that something is desirable or worth bringing about. If we interpret them in this way (and assume that, as a conceptual matter, being desirable or worth bringing about makes a normative claim on action), then it will follow from the fact that an outcome is valuable that there is some reason for the agent to realize it. It is the entailment in the other direction—between there being a reason for the agent to do something and there being an intrinsically valuable outcome that the action would realize—that is not conceptually guaranteed. Hence, it cannot follow from the fact that an action would realize the most valuable outcomes that it is what the agent should do, all things considered. So far as the concept of reason for acting, or of what an agent should do, goes, there might be reasons for acting other than those provided by the value of outcomes.

But just for this reason, again, the aim of bringing about outcomes can be regarded as substantive with respect to action. Although it cannot be action's formal aim, it might nonetheless be action's substantive aim. And, again, this is the way things seem from the naïve practical standpoint. What action seems to be for is the bringing about of valuable states.

<sup>16</sup> Neither need we concern ourselves with whether such value can be agent-neutral (as Moore himself certainly supposed) or whether it is agent-relative. What matters, for present purposes, is the relation between the value of outcomes and reasons to act.

<sup>17</sup> That no interesting claim about the good could be a conceptual truth was, of course, one of Moore's main points in *Principia.* That is why it is so ironic (or so revelatory of the depth of his error) that he could have failed to see that the same thing must be true about the right (or the rational) to do.

### **Free Agency and the Second-Person Standpoint**

What Fichte's arguments demonstrate, however, is that the perspective we get on our own agency in the second-person standpoint shows us that this cannot be right. When we are summoned to the second-person perspective, we deliberate under the assumptions that we are agents and that as agents we can act on reasons that are not outcome-based. In taking up a second-personal summons, I relate to another who is relating to me as an agent and perforce presuppose this common agency in my deliberations. My deliberative stance requires me to assume that we both have a kind of freedom that has no analogue in theoretical reasoning, just as Fichte says, and, consequently, that bringing about valuable outcomes could not possibly be action's substantive aim. Because believing only what is true is belief 's substantive aim, it is psychologically impossible to believe something on grounds unrelated to that, say, because it would be more desirable to believe it. If you are considering whether to believe *p* and reason that believing *p* would be desirable, you cannot then conclude your reasoning in a belief that *p* (as you could if you thought that *p* was more likely to be true than not). Considerations other than those appropriately related to truth are reasons of the wrong kind for belief. If action's substantive aim were to bring about valuable states, it would likewise be psychologically impossible to decide, intend, or do something on any other grounds. Considerations of other kinds would be reasons of the wrong kind for action. But we see from the second-person standpoint that this is not the case; someone can decide not to step on your foot just by acknowledging your authority to demand that he not do so.

Moreover, in deliberating second-personally, I assume not just that my co-deliberator and I are both free agents, but also that we therefore have a common second-personal authority that grounds second-personal reasons. And here again I confront a fundamental difference with theoretical reasoning. Second-personal practical authority has no clear analogue in theoretical reasoning about what to believe. There can be no fundamentally second-personal reasons for belief, and hence there is no theoretical standing that is fundamentally second-personal. I can, of course, believe something because you say so, but if I do, the second-personal standing I give you in my reasoning is defeasible by your epistemic authority, that is, by your relation to facts of the world as.18 When we take up the second-

<sup>18</sup> I emphasize that the second-personal theoretical authority is defeasible by epistemic authority. I take what I am saying to be consistent with various kinds of default second-personal theoretical authority that might be ordinarily presupposed in interpersonal theoretical reasoning (Burge 1993; Coady 1992; Foley 1994; Hinchman 2000; Moran 2005; Pettit and Smith 1996).

person deliberative stance, however, we recognize a kind of reason for acting, a second-personal reason, that neither derives from nor is reducible to any value of states or outcomes. And in so doing, we recognize a practical standing that is fundamentally second-personal, which neither depends upon nor can be defeated by the other's relation to any independent order of value, that is, by whatever facts there may be about how the world should be.

To see this more vividly, suppose, first, that you are considering what to believe about the economy's future direction, say, whether it will recover in the next quarter. You examine evidence of various kinds and form the belief that it will not. You then talk to me, who is convinced that the economy will bounce back. You and I engage in what Pettit and Smith (1996) call a serious "conversation of the intellectual kind." In the course of listening to my reasons, you become persuaded that what I am taking as evidence is misleading in various respects and that, even if it weren't, it would nonetheless be overridden by better reasons for thinking the economy won't recover for at least another two quarters. But I persist. "Trust me," I say, "things have to get better soon." Is it possible for you to believe that the economy will soon improve just because I have told you it will?19 That is, can you believe that it will get better simply for the reason that I have told you (or, at least tried to tell you) that it will? You could certainly believe this if you suspected that, despite the weakness of my stated reasons, my beliefs might be responding to other evidence that I cannot perhaps articulate. You could even believe it if you thought for some other reason that my beliefs on this matter might be likelier than yours to be true (say, because God had caused this). But without your supposing some such connection between my beliefs and facts about the world as they are anyway, it would simply be impossible for you to believe that the economy will recover presently just for the reason that I say it will (though I could of course cause you to believe it). To give me authority in reasoning about what to believe, you must take me to have

<sup>19</sup> As opposed, say, to being simply *caused* in some nonrational way to believe it by my saying so without taking either anything I say or my saying it as a reason to believe that the economy will improve.

some (epistemic) authority on the questions of fact my beliefs concern. My claim on your beliefs and your freedom of belief are both constrained by belief 's substantive aim: accurate representation of the world as it is anyway.

Now, as we have noted before, there is a kind of practical case, that of advice, that is structurally identical to the theoretical case. In fact, we might regard it as a special instance of theoretical reasoning, one in which the beliefs in question concern the practical question of what one should do. If you ask me for advice on where to invest your retirement funds during the next quarter, and you trust me, then any authority you accord me will similarly depend on what authority you take me to have on an independent question of fact, namely, what would be a sensible investment in the current economic circumstances.20 If you take me to have no epistemic authority on this question, then it will simply be impossible for you to treat my advice as reason-giving in the normal way, that is, to give you any reason to think you should do something when I say you should. An advisor's claim on your reasoning, as well as your freedom to treat it as advice, are both constrained by belief 's substantive aim: accurate representation, in this case, of (non-second-personal) reasons for acting, whose status as reasons has nothing to do with one person's authority to give them to another.

When, however, someone addresses second-personal reasons, a radically different kind of authority and freedom are in play.21 Suppose, to vary our familiar example, that it is you who has your foot on top of mine. If you recognize my claim to your removing your foot and my authority to make it, you give me second-person standing in your practical reasoning. You recognize that you should move your foot because I have the authority to demand this as, indeed, does anyone on my behalf. The authority you thus accord me in regulating your conduct by my claim is fundamentally different from that of an advisor. It is on the side of "law" and "command" rather than "counsel," according to Hobbes's famous distinction (1983: XIV.1). Unlike advice, it neither depends upon nor can be defeated by the addresser's epistemic relation to any facts that are themselves independent of the addresser's second-personal authority. Authority of the kind I claim in asking (or implicitly demanding) that

<sup>20</sup> I use 'fact' here in a sense that is not metaethically loaded, in which even noncognitivists can accept that there are facts about what one should do.

<sup>21</sup> On this point, see, again, Wolff 1970: 7.

you move your foot is fundamentally second-personal. I presume upon your and my (presupposed) equal standing as free and rational persons, and if you recognize my demand, you and I both presuppose that you can move your foot simply by recognizing and acting on the second-personal reason I address to you (or that we both understand the moral community to have been addressing to you before I even opened my mouth).22

The crucial point here is that, since second-personal reasons neither reduce to nor derive from the independent value of any outcome, in assuming that you can act for this reason, you and I presuppose that you can act on a reason the recognition of which is independent of your (object-guided) valuation of outcomes, including as these might apparently be given in object-dependent desires. And because we take ourselves to be responsible for acting as these reasons direct, we must also assume that we have a source of motivation to do so that comes just from what makes us subject to these reasons in the first place. As I have argued, therefore, we presuppose the autonomy of our respective wills (as second-personally competent).

It follows that we must assume autonomy of the will from the same perspective through which we get a deliberative purchase on our own agency. In getting an agent's grasp of our own agency, we see that what seemed to be true from a naïve practical standpoint, that action has the substantive aim of bringing about valuable outcomes, is an illusion. If action had bringing about valuable outcomes as its substantive aim, then it would simply be impossible freely and self-consciously to act against this aim, just as it is to believe in the face of what one regards to be conclusive evidence to the contrary.23 When, however, we summon one another as agents second-personally, we jointly presuppose autonomy of the will and assume we can freely govern ourselves by second-personal reasons, any object-dependent desires to the contrary notwithstanding.

<sup>22</sup> Again, moral obligations involve implicit demands that are "in force," as I noted in Chapter 1, even when actual individuals have not explicitly made them. As Strawson points out, "the making of the demand *is* the [moral community's] proneness to [reactive] attitudes" (1968: 92–93). This, again, is like Hart's interpretation of Bentham's account of law (1990: 93–94) involving "quasi-commands." See the discussion of this point in note 17 of Chapter 1.

<sup>23</sup> Note: "freely and self-consciously." Although we seem to be able to believe contrary to what we *believe* is better evidence, it is by no means clear that we can believe contrary to what we are then *seeing* as better evidence. And something comparable would be true of action if it had the substantive aim of bringing about intrinsically valuable outcomes.

We should note that the assumed freedom this line of thought supports is no liberty of indifference; action and the will still have a formal aim. Nothing counts as an action in the distinctive sense in which philosophers are interested, that is, as an exercise of genuine agency, unless the agent has some reason for acting, something she herself regards as a normative reason to perform the act and on which she acts, thereby making it her reason. What second-personal deliberation enables us to see is just that action cannot have the substantive aim of bringing about valuable outcomes.

### **The Metaethics of Practical Reason: Recognitional versus Constructivist Theories**

Of course, we can then step back from the second-person standpoint and ask whether we should accept the presuppositions to which we are committed when we take it up. But when we do, we can no longer simply take the appearances of the naïve practical standpoint for granted. We have gained a sophistication about the nature of our agency that dispels our earlier naïvete´. By the same token, however, although we can't help but assume autonomy and equal dignity when we deliberate second-personally, nothing compels us to continue to accept these when we step back and ask the most fundamental questions of practical reason.

Still, to deliberate at all, we must assume that there are some normative reasons for acting.24 So to vindicate the presuppositions of the secondperson standpoint, all we need to show is that we have no less reason to accept second-personal reasons than we do to accept reasons for acting of other kinds, for example, those relating to prudence, benevolence, or whatever. The fact is that we can step back from putative reasons of any kind and coherently question whether, or doubt that, what we take to be a reason for acting is a reason in fact. People often take it for granted, for example, that considerations of self-interest or the agent's own welfare give her reasons for acting. But that this is so is a substantive normative thesis and not a conceptual truth. Someone might have full command of the concept of reason for acting but nonetheless be so depressed that he doubts (without incoherence or conceptual confusion) that the fact that something would be for his good is any reason whatsoever for him to

<sup>24</sup> For a particularly good discussion of the metaethical consequences of this familiar point, see Enoch forthcoming.

seek it.25 And similar points can be made for any substantive reason for acting. It is enough, therefore, if we have no less reason to accept second-personal reasons than we do to accept putative reasons for acting of other kinds.

More ambitiously, we can seek to show that on the best philosophical explanations of there being normative reasons for acting at all, there is support also for autonomy and the second-personal reasons that are grounded in the second-person standpoint. Obviously, I cannot even begin to attempt a comprehensive theory of practical reason here.26 What I can do, however, is to indicate briefly how, on either of two broadly popular strategies that seem to exhaust the field, there may be good philosophical reasons that vindicate the presuppositions of the second-personal standpoint.

An intuitive way of dividing the main alternatives is to consider the relation between normative reasons for acting, on the one hand, and the rationality of deliberation or agency, on the other.27 Korsgaard formulates the "internalism requirement" by saying that "practical-reason claims, if they are really to present us with reasons for action, must be capable of motivating rational persons" (1986: 11; see also Darwall 1983: 80–81; Smith 1994: 61). But which is the independent variable: reasons or rationality of the person (or deliberative process, or whatever)? Is a person or deliberative process rational by virtue of the fact that she is motivated by or that the process identifies genuinely normative reasons, independently specified? Or is a consideration a normative reason by virtue of the fact that it would be taken as such and motivate a rational person or as the result of a rational deliberative procedure, independently specified?

Cullity and Gaut mark this difference with a useful distinction between *recognitional* and *constructivist* theories (1997: 4). (I take this to be roughly the same distinction as Korsgaard's between *substantive realism* and *procedural realism* [1996e: 36–37].) On a recognitional theory, there exist independent normative reason facts, and whether a person or deliberative procedure is rational depends upon whether she or it adequately registers or recognizes these. *Constructivism,* by contrast, holds, in this context, that what makes something a normative reason for acting is that it would

<sup>25</sup> I argue for this at greater length in chapter 1 of Darwall 2002b.

<sup>26</sup> I have, however, tried to take steps toward doing so in various places over the years: Darwall 1983, 1985, 1986b, 1990, 1992, and 1997.

<sup>27</sup> On this point, see Darwall 1986b.

be taken as such by, and be motivating for, a free and rational agent or as a result of rational deliberation.28

This is not the place to consider the merits of these respective metaethical approaches, which, as we have defined them here, would seem to exhaust the field. What I seek to do in the rest of the chapter is to say why there are good reasons on either approach to accept the proposition that, as I have already argued in Chapter 10, we must assume from the second-person standpoint, namely, that we have a dignity as free and rational persons that grounds genuine second-personal reasons.

### **Constructivism and the Second-Person Standpoint**

Constructivism (procedural realism) about practical reason is clearly the metaethical position that is most in the spirit of the Fichtean contrast between practical and theoretical reason that I have been emphasizing. The terms in which we have so far drawn the distinction do not require a constructivist account. I have argued that the Fichtean contrast requires a doctrine of autonomy of the will, but it seems possible for dignity and autonomy to be maintained at the deepest normative level within a more recognitionally realist metaphysics. Still, it seems uncontroversial that these doctrines have a greater affinity with a constructivist approach, especially of a Kantian sort (Korsgaard 1996e; Rawls 1980).

What makes someone a constructivist in our current sense is simply that she holds that the existence of normative reasons depends upon what a rational agent, or what someone deliberating about what to do rationally, would take as reasons and be motivated by. The central claim is that it is the rationality of the agent or deliberative procedure that determines normative reasons, rather than vice versa. What is then at issue within constructivism is how to specify the requisite ideal of rational agency or rational deliberation. And there have been, of course, various proposed specifications other than Kantian versions.

But all forms of constructivism agree in rejecting the recognitional realism of the naïve practical standpoint. Even non-Kantian versions of constructivism are committed to this aspect of Kant's "Copernican rev-

<sup>28</sup> This is also a kind of *existence internalism,* since it holds that being motivating (for a rational agent) is essential to being a normative reason for acting. For the distinction between *existence internalism* and *judgment internalism,* see Darwall 1983: 54–55. I discuss different varieties of internalism more comprehensively in Darwall 1997.

olution" in the practical sphere. Practical normative facts are not just "there" to be recognized or not. Rather their "way of being" is within the practical standpoint, as presuppositions and commitments of practical reasoning. Constructivism is by definition, then, a "sophisticated" position. (Indeed, to its critics, this is its problem. It is too sophisticated, they think, and out of touch with reality.)

Moreover, it can be argued that much as constructivism is the metaethical position that is most in the spirit of the Kantian/Fichtean ideas and arguments of the last two chapters, so also is a Kantian constructivism the version that is truest to constructivism's spirit. Unsurprisingly, the most popular versions of constructivism build a measure of self-reflection into their ideals of the rational agent or of rational deliberation.29 On these models, rational deliberation involves stepping back from full immersion in the agent's actual motivations and intuitive normative reason judgments. But even if we identify an agent's normative reasons, not with her actual motives, but with, say, the motives she would have if fully informed, or would want if fully informed for her actual self, or something similar, it seems we will still be treating her underlying motivational dispositions as a kind of practical "given," as having default normative status. But why should we do that? After all, we can step back from any disposition to be moved, as from any motive, and question its normative credentials. If we can't take the normative status of our actual motives for granted, why should we do so with our underlying dispositions to be moved?

Thinking along these lines leads Kantians to distinguish between the matter and form of volition and between material and formal principles of action. We can step back from any motivational bent we actually have and ask whether the object of this bent is something that there is reason for us to, or that we should, care about, try to realize, and so on. And if we reject a recognitional account of how our object-dependent desires acquire normative relevance through their relation to independent normative facts, we seem to lose any reason to grant them the default relevance that what Kant calls "material practical principles," that is, "principles that presuppose an object (matter) of the faculty of desire as the determining ground of the will" would require (1996a: 21–22). But, then,

<sup>29</sup> For example, full information theories; reflective endorsement tests; self-reflective, fully informed tests; and so on. See, for example, Brandt 1979; Korsgaard 1996e; Railton 1986; and Smith 1994.

as Kant says, "nothing is left but the conformity of actions as such with universal law, which is alone to serve the will as its principle" (1996b: 402). Kantian constructivists argue therefore that what leads us to reject recognitional theories should lead us also to accept autonomy of the will.30

Of course, Kantians can't simply assume autonomy. But several factors now seem to converge to recommend the doctrine. First, we inescapably presuppose it when we address or acknowledge any (putative) second-personal reason. Second, within a constructivist framework, the will's being a law to itself by virtue of its form seems to be, for the reasons mentioned in the last two paragraphs, what the philosophical impulse leading to constructivism tends to in general. And third, we can combine these two ideas and say further that the standpoint from which we gain a self-reflective deliberative awareness of the autonomous agency that seems most deeply to underlie constructivism is one from which we presuppose autonomy of the will in the Kantian sense.31 If, consequently, the metaethical theory we accept when we step back from the second-person standpoint is constructivist, there seem to be good reasons for thinking that the assumptions of dignity and autonomy we inescapably make within that standpoint are ones that will at least survive at the metaethical level, if not find further support.

On a Kantian constructivist picture, the doctrine of autonomy expresses itself in the idea that substantive, reason-grounding norms must be constructible through a procedure that can itself be seen to be internal to the exercise of the will. This requires companion conceptions of autonomous will and constructivist procedure that must fit one another. Our conception of what it is to be an autonomous will must itself include the capacity to engage in the relevant procedure of construction, and our conception of the relevant procedure must be such that it can be realized, in principle, in autonomous wills.32 This, of course, is what we find in

<sup>30</sup> The lesson that Kantian constructivists draw from this is, in effect, that agency could not, by its very nature, have a substantive aim. The lesson seems to be that the aim of action is autonomy, understood, not in nonnormative terms, but as following formal norms we are committed to as free and rational wills. For a defense of the idea that the substantive aim of action is autonomy, understood, roughly as self-direction driven by a desire for self-understanding, see Velleman 2000.

<sup>31</sup> That there is a deep connection between autonomy, conceived as the capacity to step back from and critically evaluate actual motives, and the open question argument is a theme that is discussed in Rosati 1995 and 2003 and in Darwall 1990 and 1992.

<sup>32</sup> Cf. Rawls's discussion of "rational autonomy" (of the parties to the original position as agents of construction) and "full autonomy" (of citizens as persons who can both take up the constructive position of the parties and regulate themselves by the principles they would rationally choose or construct) (1980: 520–521).

Kant's companion ideas of autonomy of the will and the CI, at least as these are interpreted within constructivism. The CI-procedure, as it is sometimes called, is a constructive process that involves considering what can be rationally willed from a perspective of one among other free and rational persons, where what it is to be such a person includes having the capacity to take up this perspective.33

Now I have been arguing that this is precisely the perspective we do take up when we address one another second-personally and, correspondingly, that we are committed to the second-personal version of the CI when we do. (I develop this latter theme further in Chapter 12.) The second-person standpoint itself presupposes, as we saw in Chapter 10, the companion ideas of autonomy of the will and of a kind of normative reason for acting, second-personal reasons, that we must assume to be acceptable to addressees as free and equal persons. And it provides as well a conception of the role of specific substantive norms of moral obligation, namely, as mediating reciprocal respect between mutually accountable free and equal persons.34 As I argued at the end of Chapter 9, this can be provided by an interpretation of the CI-procedure that grounds it in dignity conceived as equal second-personal authority.

In addition, a Kantian constructivism can lead to a contractualist normative theory of these more specific norms and normative reasons. A constructive procedure can be mobilized not just at the metaethical level to vindicate the normative pretensions of the moral law (the dignity of persons) in general, but also in the foundations of normative moral theory to provide an account of what specific mandatory norms we are

<sup>33</sup> As in Rawls's interpretation of Kant and those who follow him. See Rawls 2000.

<sup>34</sup> I discuss this in Chapter 12. It can sometimes seem to be missing from some of Kant's formulations of the Categorical Imperative, such as the Formula of Universal Law: "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law [or universal law of nature]" (1996b: 421). However, once we appreciate how holding someone responsible or accountable just is, essentially, relating to her as a person, we can see how the Formula of Humanity, which requires us to treat humanity or rational nature always as an end in itself, and the Formulas of Autonomy and of the Realm of Ends, should be interpreted in such a way that moral legislation involves legislating principles as norms with which we are accountable for complying.

committed to complying with as mutually accountable free and rational persons.35 In the next chapter, we turn to how the second-person standpoint can help provide a rationale for contractualist accounts of moral obligation, where mandatory norms are seen to result from a hypothetical choice or contract from the perspective of free and equal persons. Whether we conceive of such a procedure, as Rawls does, in terms of a choice behind a veil of ignorance, or as Scanlon does, in terms of what no one could reasonably reject, or as Thomas Hill has proposed, as specifying an ideal of equal respect, contractualism provides a way of thinking of the justification of mandatory norms within moral reasoning for which, I argue, the second-person standpoint can provide a more fundamental rationale (Hill 1989; Rawls 1971: 17, 111; Scanlon 1998).36

### **Recognitional Theories and the Second-Person Standpoint**

So far, then, we have seen some reasons to think that the equal authority of free and rational agents to which we are committed in the secondperson standpoint can survive, indeed that it can find further support, when we step back from that perspective and pursue metaethical reflection in a constructivist vein. But there is no reason to think that this phenomenon is restricted to constructivism.

According to recognitional theories, deliberation is a matter of registering considerations whose status as reasons is independent of any ideal of rational deliberation. As we ordinarily experience it, a desire for some outcome involves its seeming as if there is some reason to realize the outcome and as if one is somehow in rapport with this normative fact. Now if a recognitional theory were to credit only the ethical intuitions and judgments we are inclined to from a naïve practical standpoint, then it would require us to think that no second-personal reasons exist and that both the dignity of persons and autonomy of the will are chimerical ideas. But there is absolutely no reason for a recognitional theory to

<sup>35</sup> That these two levels should be distinguished is illustrated by the example of Scanlon (1998), a normative contractualist who does not advance constructivism as a metaethical position.

<sup>36</sup> Here I have in mind Rawls's idea of "rightness as fairness," rather than the more specifically political philosophical uses to which Rawls put the contractualist idea after *A Theory of Justice* (1971: 17, 111).

restrict itself in this way. Object-dependent desires or Moorean intuitions surely do not exhaust the range of our ethical experiences and intuitive judgments. Most importantly for our purposes, reactive attitudes also present themselves as responding to normative reasons for acting, and in this instance the reasons are second-personal.37 What possible reason could we have for thinking that our object-dependent desires and intuitive judgments of intrinsic value or desirability are evidentiary or veridical that we would not also have for so regarding intuitive judgments of second-personal reasons and second-personal authority? From a recognitional perspective, there seems no more reason to think that our desires give us access to the existence of normative reasons for outcomes than for thinking that reactive attitudes are evidence for second-personal reasons grounded in second-personal authority.

Moreover, whether addressing second-personal reasons invariably presupposes autonomy and dignity, as I have argued, or not, there seems no doubt whatsoever that we experience feelings that present themselves as responses to reasons grounded in dignity, that is, as instances of Kantian *reverentia.*38 When Omar Khatib feels remorse at having shot David Blumenfeld and expresses it, calling him, for the first time, "David," must we not interpret Omar as having a powerful feeling that there was reason for him not to have done what he did that derives from David's dignity?39 Similarly, when someone is subjected arbitrarily to the will of another, this can give her a sense of her own dignity through her reactive response to the other's self-conceit. Surely, we can hear something like this in Sojourner Truth's famous speech to the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, in 1851: "And ain't I a woman?"

When we have such feelings of recognition respect for persons, whether for ourselves or others, we seem to be presented with valid reasons for acting no less vividly than we are when we ardently desire an outcome. Absent some further explanation, there is no reason to credit the latter experiences but not the former. So here again, when we step back and reflect metaethically, this time in a recognitional realist vein, the equal

<sup>37</sup> On this point, see Chapter 4.
<sup>38</sup> See Chapter 6.

<sup>39</sup> Recall here Adam Smith's remark, discussed in Chapter 4, that what resentment is "chiefly intent upon, is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as . . . to make him sensible that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner" (1982a: 95–96).

dignity of persons to which we were committed in the second-person standpoint at least survives and arguably finds additional support.

To deliberate at all, you and I must presuppose that there are normative reasons for acting. But what reasons for acting are there? In this chapter, I have argued both that we have no less reason to accept second-personal reasons grounded in equal dignity than we do reasons for acting of other kinds and that these second-personal reasons can plausibly be accounted for on the major metaethical theories of reasons for acting. If we must assume the existence of normative reasons to deliberate at all, and if our best theories of normative reasons validate equal second-personal authority, then we should conclude that, for practical purposes, at least, second-reasons grounded in our common dignity really do exist.

## 12. A Foundation for Contractualism

In the early and middle chapters of this book, I attempted to draw out some of the ways in which the second-person standpoint and second-personal reasons are implicated in our understanding of moral obligation and the equal dignity of persons. In more recent chapters, I have argued that the demands we have standing to make of one another as persons generate valid normative reasons for acting.1 But what, more specifically, do these reasons require? What do "we owe to each other" (Scanlon 1998) as equal moral persons?

This final chapter is obviously not the place to try to answer that question. I invoke Scanlon's famous phrase in part to suggest, however, that although they do not require it, the arguments I have been advancing in this book lead naturally to a contractualist approach to attempting to do so. The fundamental idea of the dignity of persons, to which I have claimed we are committed from the second-person standpoint, is mutual accountability as equals. And this commits us to regulating our conduct by principles that are acceptable, or not reasonably rejectable, to each as free and rational agents. When we attempt to hold anyone accountable by addressing second-personal reasons of any kind, we presuppose that the authority and principles we implicitly invoke are ones our addressee

<sup>1</sup> Have I shown that such reasons are supremely authoritative? If the argument of Chapter 10 is sound, we cannot avoid presupposing the equal dignity of free and rational persons when we address second-personal reasons of any kind. Since attempting to hold one another accountable through second-personal address itself apparently involves an assumption of the supremacy of the accountability-seeking second-personal reasons (see Chapter 5), it is hard to see how to avoid presupposing the supremacy of reasons of equal dignity.

can be expected to accept, or not reasonably to reject, as a free and rational agent who is apt for second-personal address.

In this final chapter, I briefly develop the idea that the second-person standpoint can ground a contractualist normative moral theory. It is a hallmark of contractualist theories that they hold principles of right to have a distinctive *role,* namely, as mediating relations of mutual respect. According to the "contractualist ideal," Scanlon says, we realize "mutual recognition" or reciprocal respect as equals when we conform to principles of right, understood as contractualism understands them (1998: 162). This is so for two different but related reasons. First, the *content* of contractualist principles specifies our obligations to one another as equals. Complying with these principles can thus show respect for each other as persons who may not be treated in some ways and who must be treated in others.2 Second, but no less importantly, contractualism also maintains that the *form* of principles of right is mutual accountability to one another as equal persons. When, consequently, Scanlon says that an act is wrong "if it would be disallowed by any principle that no one could reasonably reject," we should understand this to mean: an act is wrong if the act would be disallowed by a principle no one could reasonably reject our holding one another accountable for complying with. It is the right's connection to accountability, indeed, that makes a "no-reasonablerejection" test appropriate in the first place. It is because a moral obligation presents a demand that it is staked on its addressee's not being able reasonably to reject the principle that underlies it (again: to reject it as a basis for demands through mutual accountability). An art critic need not withdraw a critical judgment just because the artist she is criticizing might reasonably reject its grounds. But this is not so when we make demands in holding one another accountable. As we saw in Chapter 5 (and again in our discussion of Kant's "fact of reason" in Chapter 10), in addressing moral demands, we imply that there are conclusive second-personal reasons that our addressee is (second-personally) competent to accept and freely determine himself by. And that commits us to denying the possibility of reasonably rejecting a principle that it would be wrong to violate.

So this is the second place where mutual recognition or respect enters

<sup>2</sup> Complying with these principles is not, however, sufficient to manifest full respect for persons, as I argued in Chapter 6.

the contractualist picture: the form and role that principles of right have in contractualism. In holding ourselves mutually accountable for conforming to contractualist principles of right, we recognize one another's equal standing to demand respect.

We may well think, however, that moral obligations have a wider scope, that their content extends beyond duties we owe (in the first instance) simply to persons. Many of us believe that we have moral obligations to nonrational humans and other animals and, indeed, to the natural environment that can neither be derived from nor be reduced to any "we owe to each other."3 If, however, we take moral responsibility to be part of what moral obligation involves in such cases, then we must hold that we are accountable to one another (as members of the moral community) in these cases as well (that is, by virtue of principles' form). I am inclined strongly to think that the content of moral obligations does have this wider scope. But I know of no promising way of vindicating these thoughts that does not build upon or extend from accountability in the central second-personal case.4

Contractualism, then, is concerned by its very nature with second-personal relations of mutual accountability and respect. Principles of right express normative relations between persons, and violations must be understood against this background. If I wrong someone, then, as Scanlon points out, "my relation with them is already altered by that fact, whatever they do."

They may retaliate in some way, or they may forgive me. But forgiveness is merely a willingness to forgo reacting to a wrong in ways one would be justified in doing, such as by being angry or severing friendly relations. It does not alter the wrong that has been done. (272)

The fundamental contractualist moral relation is thus mutual respect. Wrongs violate that relation; they fail adequately to recognize the dignity of persons and so call it into question. They therefore warrant a reciprocally recognizing response that seeks to reestablish mutual respect, demanding it of the violator in a way that simultaneously bestows it on him.5

<sup>3</sup> I briefly discuss the accountability of human beings who are not fully morally competent in Chapter 4.

<sup>4</sup> For a very interesting set of reflections on giving responsibility to (other) animals, see Hearne 1986. I am indebted to Elizabeth Anderson for this reference.

<sup>5</sup> Recall, again, Strawson's remark that to respond to another with a reactive attitude is "to view him as a member of the moral community; only as one who offended against its demands" (1968: 93) and Adam Smith's claim that resentment aims to make another feel our dignity (1982: 95–96). See the discussion of both of these in Chapter 4. Cf. also Hegel's famous idea of the right to punishment (1991: §100).

### **Versions of Contractualism**

Common to all contractualist theories is the idea that the content of the moral obligations we owe to one another as equal moral persons is to be explained as the result of a (hypothetical) agreement, choice, or "contract" from some perspective that situates individuals equally as moral persons (and so expresses respect for persons as such). This general idea can be developed in different ways. Justice as fairness, as Rawls presents it in *ATheory of Justice,* is a contractualist theory of justice. And Rawls there suggests a theory of moral right, "rightness as fairness," which can be developed along similar lines. Principles of right apply to individual conduct rather than to the basic structure of society, but otherwise rightness as fairness attempts to explicate such principles in a manner similar to the more familiar "derivation" of principles of justice. There are the same elements: the "original position" with its "veil of ignorance," a mutually disinterested choice of principles from that perspective as instrumentally rational in advancing the parties' interests ("primary goods") as free and equal persons, and so on (Rawls 1971: 17, 111).6 But whereas the parties in the original position choose principles of justice to inform the public criticism of their basic social structure, we should understand principles in "rightness as fairness" as informing the kind of criticism that is distinctive of moral obligation—mutual accountability.7 The parties in the original position choose principles with which people are to be held accountable for complying.

Scanlon's version differs from "rightness as fairness" in three important

<sup>6</sup> Rawls specifies these interests further by stipulating that the parties have "highestorder interests" in exercising their moral personality (living on terms of mutual respect) and in rationally choosing and revising their own conceptions of the good) and a "higherorder interest" in "protecting and advancing their conception of the good" (1980: 525). For a discussion of the so-called "Kantian interpretation" of Rawls's theory of justice, including of his idea of primary goods, see Darwall 1980. After his 1980 Dewey Lectures, Rawls presented his ideas wholly within the framework of political liberalism, and so turned away from questions of normative moral theory and from deeper philosophical rationales or other "comprehensive doctrines" that might be controversial in a liberal society.

<sup>7</sup> Rawls distinguishes between moral obligations and natural duties, reserving the term "obligation" for those that arise from some sort voluntary initiating act; however, this distinction does not matter for our purposes (1999: 93–101).

ways. It employs no informational constraint like the veil of ignorance. Its derivation depends on an avowedly moral idea of "reasonable" rather than (a suitably constrained) "rational" acceptance or rejection (where standards of rationality are independent of moral criteria). And its procedural standard or benchmark is that no one be able reasonably to reject a candidate principle, as opposed to the principle's being one that any person could or would rationally or reasonably choose or accept.

We need not here consider the relative merits of these or other forms of contractualism.8 My aim in this last chapter is to argue that what is common to contractualist approaches, that we are mutually accountable for regulating ourselves by principles that are acceptable (in some suitable sense) to each as equal moral persons, can itself be grounded in, and is best appreciated from, the second-person standpoint. Or, to put the point the other way round: the most promising way to work out the content of moral principles we are committed to by the equal dignity we must presuppose in the second-person perspective is through some version of contractualism.

### **Contractualism and the Categorical Imperative**

Since Kant is the philosopher whose ideas stand most clearly behind contractualism, it may help to begin by sketching briefly the relations in Kant's ethics between the dignity of persons, as it operates within the Formula of Humanity (FH) ("So act that you use humanity, whether in our own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means" [Kant 1996b: 429]) and other formulations of the CI. Persons by their nature, have a dignity that makes treating them (or humanity or rationality in them) as a mere means a violation. They are, as Kamm (1989, 1992) and Nagel (1995) have put it, "inviolable": beings who may not be treated as a mere means. But what is it to treat someone, or to treat humanity or rationality in that person, merely as a means?

It is widely acknowledged that there are ways of wronging others forms of deception, manipulation, and coercion, for example—that treat

<sup>8</sup> Another example is Hill 1989. By contrast, "contractarianism" is the view that moral principles of right derive from a mutually advantageous contract, as in Harman 1977, Gauthier 1986, and, arguably, in Hobbes 1994. For a discussion of the differences between contractualism and contractarianism, see the introduction to Darwall 2002a.

a person's rationality merely instrumentally (Korsgaard 1996b; Wood 1999: 124–132). But when is utilizing someone's rationality or humanity using it merely as a means? Recall the contrast, which played a central role in the argument of Chapter 10, between coercing by threats and holding someone accountable through notice of a warranted sanction There is a sense in which threats are addressed to a person's rationality, or to a person as rational. After all, threats do their work through the threatened person's practical reasoning. But this just means that their target is the person's reason. A threat does not, however, address a person in the sense with which we have been concerned in this book; indeed, a threat need not address a person in any obvious sense. It could suffice for the threatened person simply to learn about a likely consequence of some act in a way that involves no communication at all, say, by seeing a gun trained on him in a mirror. When, however, someone addresses a second-personal demand, he purports to address (and, I have argued, to respect) the other as a free and rational agent.

Any valid second-personal reason must be addressable to free and rational persons as such not just in the way a threat is "addressed" to a person's rationality but to someone as having a normative standing as rational. It is a presupposition of this address that the (second-personal) reason and the authority relations in which it is grounded must be acceptable to the other as a free and rational person. If, consequently, it makes a demand on the other as an equal person, then it must be the case that the other would rationally endorse or not reasonably reject it as a demand with which persons are to be held accountable for complying. Second-personal reasoning is essentially justification to one another, just as Scanlon understands reasoning about our moral obligations.

Suppose, again, that a sergeant in a citizen militia of a free and democratic republic issues an order to a private to do ten pushups and that she informs the private that he will be confined to quarters if he fails to comply.9 Such an address differs from a mere threat in a fundamental way.10 If the sergeant had lacked her authority and simply threatened the same evil, then that would have been coercion pure and simple, using the person or his rationality as a mere means. Moreover, as we saw in Chapter 10, in holding the private accountable for complying, the ser-

<sup>9</sup> Assume, again, that such sanction is fully within normal practice, that it is subject to democratic citizen review, that it is applied with due process, and so on.

<sup>10</sup> This, again, is Pufendorf 's Point.

geant must herself presuppose this distinction. And as we also saw, she can intelligibly assume this only if she can presuppose as well that the private can be expected to accept her authority, and the principles that give her orders normative force, as a free and rational agent. This is what ties accountability to a rational-acceptance, or to a no-reasonablerejection, test. In attempting to hold another accountable, second-personally, one purports to address him as free and rational. And to make a demand of someone as free and rational, one must presuppose that the person can freely determine himself by that same demand, that the demand is one he can accept, or not reasonably reject, as free and rational, and therefore make of himself. Respecting the dignity of persons is thus tied to holding oneself accountable for complying with demandauthorizing-principles that free and rational persons would accept, or could not reasonably reject, as such.

In my view, this is what links FH to the formulations of the CI more usually associated with contractualism: the Formula of the Realm of Ends (FRE) and, when properly understood, the Formulation of Universal Law (FUL). The idea of a realm or "kingdom of ends," Kant says, is that of "a systematic union of rational beings through common laws."

For all rational beings stand under the *law* that each of them is to treat himself and all others *never merely as a means* but always *at the same time as ends in themselves.* But from this there arises a systematic union of rational beings through common objective laws. (1996b: 433)

And this implies FRE: "Every rational being must act as if he were by his maxims at all times a lawgiving member of the universal kingdom of ends" (Kant 1996c: 438).

Contractualism is an interpretation of this fundamental Kantian doctrine. When we add in the Kantian claim by which we were guided in Chapter 10, namely, that dignity is a second-personal authority "by which" a person "exacts respect for himself from all other rational beings," we get that a "realm of ends" is a community of equal, free, and rational agents who hold themselves mutually accountable for complying with demands they can accept or not reasonably reject and so make of one another as free and rational (1996d: 434–435). Persons can make some specific demand of each other, therefore, only if they can expect that each would sensibly accept the demand, or that no one could reasonably reject it, as free and rational. And this means that they can make the demand only if they can expect that each would accept, or could not reasonably reject, as free and rational, that people be held accountable for complying with the principle that specifies the demand.

As we noted first in Chapters 4 and 5, the idea of moral accountability inevitably brings in the companion idea of moral community, which is implicit also in the ideas of moral obligation and the dignity of persons. We make moral demands, and hold ourselves and one another accountable, from the perspective of equal members of the moral community. In making ourselves mutually accountable we function as equal lawexecuting or law-enforcing members of the moral community. But FRE brings in the idea of moral community in another fundamental way: each person is to conduct herself as though she were a "lawgiving member" of the realm of ends. We have an equal standing not just in executing or enforcing the moral law (whatever its content), but also in "determining" its content. As with contractualism, I believe the most promising way of interpreting Kant's idea is not in terms of any actual determination of the moral law by actual persons but, rather, in terms of the law's being determined by some hypothetical, idealized process of agreement that situates the parties as equal persons. Persons function as equal law-giving and law-executing members of the moral community, the realm of ends, then, when they hold themselves and one another responsible for complying with mandatory principles that would rationally be accepted by all free and rational persons as such, or reasonably rejected by none, that is, from a hypothetical perspective that situates the parties equally in these respects (for example, behind a veil of ignorance regarding individuating differences). For this reason, Kant calls the principles that specify demands we can make on each person as free and rational "common laws." They satisfy Rousseau's famous formula of mediating a form of association "by means of which each, uniting with all, nevertheless obeys only himself" (1997: 49–50).

Now FRE differs substantially from the letter of FUL: "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same will that it become a universal law [or universal law of nature]" (Kant 1996b: 421). Read narrowly, FUL says that it is morally unacceptable to act on some maxim or principle if one could not oneself will (choose, accept) that it become universal law. So interpreted, it says nothing about what others must be able to accept or be unable to reject. By contrast, what Parfit (2004) calls "Kant's Contractualist Formula" requires that "we ought to act on the principles that *everyone* could rationally choose," which clearly seems more in the spirit of FRE.

Now I argued in Chapters 9 and 10 that we should take the most fundamental idea in the Kantian framework to be the dignity of persons, conceived as an equal basic second-personal authority. As I see it, contractualist formulae are a way of developing or further specifying this idea.11 We can think along the same lines in Kant's framework if we take FH as fundamental, interpret FH in terms of FRE, and then interpret FUL in its light. This gives us a way of unifying all formulations of the CI, as Kant clearly and explicitly intends (1996b: 436). The underlying idea is that we treat rational nature, whether in ourselves or in others, as an end in itself by holding ourselves and each other responsible for complying with principles that we and they could will (or not reasonably reject) as universal law. The relevant willing must be of a certain kind and from a certain perspective, however. If, for example, the reason I (or anyone) could not will that some principle universally govern conduct is because of some idiosyncratic interest that is neither rooted in nor supported by any interest I have as a free and equal rational person, then it is hard to see how Kant could hold it to be morally relevant. Alternatively, if the interest meets this test but I object to a principle's being universally governing because of the way it affects my interests as an equal member, though I wouldn't if it were someone else, then this is also an objection of the wrong kind to a candidate moral principle.12 Similarly, the Formula of Autonomy (FA) holds that we are to constrain our conduct by "the idea of the will of every rational being as a *will giving universal law*"

<sup>11</sup> Wood (1999) also thinks that the dignity of persons is Kant's fundamental idea, but unlike Wood, I believe neither that we can simply interpret FH directly, in its own terms, nor that the various universalization procedures, including FUL, should be ignored as empty or morally problematic. Furthermore, in my view, what is fundamental is not dignity as a freestanding value, but second-personal authority.

<sup>12</sup> This may seem to be incompatible with a Rawlsian version of contractualism, because the parties in the original position choose principles in a mutually disinterested way, as instrumentally rational in furthering their own (highest-order) interests as rational persons. But that would misunderstand the way in which the motivations of the parties works in combination with the veil of ignorance constraint. It would work equally well to suppose that the parties are trustees for an individual citizen and her interests (about whom the veil of ignorance prohibits further knowledge) and gave no weight to their own interests. The arguments from the original position would be exactly the same in both cases. On this point, see Darwall 1980: 340–343. Rawls notes this point himself (2001: 84–85).

(1996b: 432, see also 434, 438, 440). Here again, it seems clear that we should take FA to be governed by FRE. In general, then, FRE, which is the most clearly contractualist version of the CI, also seems to be its most fundamental "procedural" version. And this procedural idea, in turn, is grounded in the most fundamental idea to which we are committed from the second-person standpoint: FH and the equal dignity of free and rational persons.

### **The Basis for Rational Acceptance or Reasonable Rejection in Contractualism**

An ideal of moral community as mutually accountable free and rational persons can also provide a basis from which to argue within contractualist procedures, namely, through interests individuals have as such members. This is perhaps clearest in Thomas E. Hill Jr.'s version of "Kantian Constructivism" (1989), which includes a less restrictive veil of ignorance than Rawls's and considers what principles ideal legislators could accept when they attempt to specify more precisely the equal dignity of persons. And even though Rawls's standard of "rational" choice in the original position is instrumentalist and morally neutral, it is harnessed to a conception of the "fundamental aims" of the parties that privileges "highest-order interests" they have as mutually accountable free and rational persons in exercising their "two moral powers," namely, their capacity for a sense of justice (or, in "rightness as fairness," to hold themselves and one another morally accountable) and their capacity to "form, revise, and rationally to pursue a conception of the good" (Rawls 1980: 525).

Scanlon is less concerned to provide a unified account of the grounds for reasonable acceptance or rejection, but he does say that the "range of reasons which are taken to be relevant" comes from the parties' aim of "finding principles that others who share this aim could not reasonably reject" (1998: 192; see also Kumar 2003). The shared aim, fully spelled out, is to find principles that, now to use my vocabulary, free and rational persons concerned to live mutually accountably on terms of equal respect could not reasonably reject. It is hard to see what could be relevant to this other than interests that free and rational persons can be presumed to have in living self-directed lives on terms of mutual respect with others, that is, something like the highest-order interests in exercising their "moral powers" to which Rawls refers.13 In whichever of these ways the contractualist approach is specifically developed, therefore, the idea of mutually accountable free and rational persons (to which we are committed from the second-person standpoint) can be appealed to within it to help assess whether candidate principles of moral obligation can be rationally accepted or reasonably rejected. A natural example is the interest in freedom from arbitrary direction by others to which we appealed in the argument of Chapter 10. This is evident in Fichte's principle of right ("I must in all cases recognize the free being outside me as a free being, i.e., I must limit my freedom through the concept of the possibility of his freedom" [2000: 49]) and in Kant's "universal principle of right" ("Any action is *right* if it can coexist with everyone's freedom in accordance with a universal law, or if on its maxim the freedom of choice of each can coexist with everyone's freedom in accordance with a universal law" [1996c: 230].

### **Contractualism and Rule-Consequentialism**

We can help consolidate these points by considering Parfit's recent claim (2004) that "Kantian Contractualism" (KC) implies rule-consequentialism, the view that we should comply with whatever principles the general acceptance of which would have the best consequences. KC holds, again, that "we ought to act on the principles that everyone could rationally choose." KC rules out act-consequentialism for familiar consequentialist reasons. The consequences that matter from the standpoint of contractualist choice are those of a principle's universal acceptance—both in practical reasoning and through mutual accountability. And consequentialists widely accept that things most likely go better overall when everyone accepts and regulates themselves interpersonally by principles other than act-consequentialism.14 That, after all, is what lies behind Mill's rule-utilitarian theory of justice.

Actually Parfit does not claim that rationality requires a choice of

<sup>13</sup> Kumar 2003 can be interpreted somewhat along these lines.

<sup>14</sup> This is a point about the "acceptance-utility" or "acceptance-consequences" of candidate principles, as opposed to their "conformance-utility" or "conformanceconsequences." See, for example, Lyons 1965. In Parfit's terms, act-consequentialism is "indirectly collectively self-defeating," and possibly also "self-effacing" (1984: 27–43). See also Hare 1981.

principles whose acceptance would make things go best overall (that is, effectively, a choice of rule-consequentialism). What he argues, very roughly, is that rationality always permits choosing whatever leads to the best outcomes, impartially considered, and that in this instance rationality permits everyone to choose principles whose acceptance would be optimific, that is, principles with which compliance is mandated by ruleconsequentialism.

We need not worry about the details of Parfit's argument, since what we have already enables us to formulate a contractualist response. The argument's major problem is that it ignores the form that principles of right have on a contractualist theory, namely, their role in mediating mutual respect through mutual accountability. The contractualist can acknowledge the existence of impartial outcome-given reasons in general, and she can also agree *arguendo*, without threatening anything she is committed to, that it can be rational for an individual to sacrifice selfinterest in order to further impartially better outcomes. But, consistently with this, she can nonetheless deny that such a ranking of outcomes itself provides a reason of the right sort for principles of moral obligation or right. Principles of right are not simply standards for individual choice; they lay out what we have standing to demand from one another by holding each other accountable. To be a reason of the right kind to warrant a principle of right, therefore, a consideration must relate to interests we are entitled to presuppose from within a second-person standpoint, as members of a community of independent, mutually accountable, free, and rational persons.

This, of course, is Strawson's Point transposed to the issue between rule-consequentialism and contractualism. The desirability of outcomes, taken by itself, is a reason of the wrong kind to ground claims of moral responsibility, and, consequently, claims of moral obligation. The basis of choice that Parfit mentions is not this crude, however. It does not propose to substitute direct consequentialist reasoning for the principles we employ in practices of accountability. Rather, like Mill in chapter 5 of *Utilitarianism,* it proposes to treat the desirability of outcomes as a test of principles' suitability for employment in these practices.15 But, as we have noted before, this seems simply to postpone the problem: how can the authority of someone to demand something derive simply from the de-

<sup>15</sup> See also Rawls 1955.

sirability of his being able to do so? This seems, again, to be a reason of the wrong kind for second-personal accountability not just in individual cases, but also for establishing the relevant practices themselves. The most that it can ground is a desire to be able to demand something, not any demand, or practice of accountability, itself. The problem with ruleconsequentialism, then, is that it attempts to derive principles of right from reasons of the wrong kind.

That said, contractualism might be represented as a kind of ruleconsequentialism in a purely formal sense. Suppose we consider a Rawlsian version of contractualism with a choice of principles from behind a veil of ignorance. And suppose we accept the argument of Harsanyi (1978) and many of Rawls's critics that it is rational for the parties to assume that it is equally probable that they could be anyone (once the veil is lifted).16 Now it would be a mistake to conclude from this that the parties should choose principles that would maximize their "actual," "extra-veil" utilities, as defined by whatever preferences they will come to have, for reasons we have just discussed. Rawls's idea is rather that we impute to the parties certain preferences and interests, their "highestorder interests" in living self-directed lives on terms of mutual accountability and respect, and that the parties are to be understood as making a rational choice of principles from the standpoint of furthering these imputed preferences, subject to the constraints of a veil of ignorance.

But if we allow the parties the assumption that it is equally likely they could be anyone, then why wouldn't it be rational for them to choose principles the acceptance of which would maximize the average satisfaction of these imputed preferences, that is, principles that would maximize average utility when the relevant utility measure is defined not on actual preferences but on the imputed preferences that parties have as members of the realm of ends (as mutually accountable free and rational persons)? Such a choice would seem to maximize the expected utility of the parties and thus be the instrumentally rational choice from their standpoint.17 I

<sup>16</sup> Rawls denies this, arguing that the decision problem must be considered as one under uncertainty rather than under risk, in the technical decision-theoretic sense, and that the appropriate decision principle is maximin (1971: 154–157).

<sup>17</sup> Again, Rawls gives various reasons for rejecting the equi-probability assumption and treats the problem of choice as one of uncertainty rather than risk. We need take no stand on how cogent these reasons are. My point is that even if they aren't, and even if Kantian contractualism is a form of rule-consequentialism in a purely formal sense, nothing of theoretical importance hangs on this point. For example, it is consistent with this that the parties should also choose the Difference Principle (that is, that the Difference Principle would satisfy a rule-consequentialism of this formal kind).

see no deep reason for a contractualist to resist this proposal. Just as once we have the distinction between object-dependent and principledependent desires, we can accommodate autonomous, mutually accountable conduct within belief/desire psychology without conceding anything a Kantian moral psychologist need care about, so also it seems that a Kantian contractualist might concede that her view is a version of ruleconsequentialism in this purely formal sense without compromising anything of fundamental theoretical importance.18 Since the relevant interests themselves cannot be defined independently of the idea of second-personal accountability, and so long as the contractualist framework rests ultimately on equal second-personal authority, any consequentialism of this purely formal sort does not risk getting authority simply from desirability of outcomes, that is, being based on reasons of the wrong kind.19

What matters most for the contractualist is what we are committed to from the second-person standpoint, namely the equal dignity and mutual accountability of free and rational persons. This both provides the foundation for a contractualist account of principles of right in general and shapes the specific interpretations of rational choice or reasonable rejection that are employed within different contractualist accounts.

### **The Role of Publicity and Principles**

The right's connection to mutual accountability also explains why it essentially involves publicly articulable principles in a way that other ethical standards, such as ideals of virtue, need not.20 Standards of right and

<sup>18</sup> I am indebted to Allan Gibbard for discussion of these points.

<sup>19</sup> Cf. Scanlon: "The fact that it would be a good thing if people were discouraged from [certain] actions by threat of legal punishment and social disapproval, or by an ingrained tendency to feel disapproval toward themselves, could provide a reason to acquire such a tendency, but that does not amount to a reason not to so act. What we need to do, then, is to explain more clearly how the idea that an act is wrong flows from the idea that there is an objection of a certain kind to people's being allowed to perform such actions, and we need to do this in a way that makes clear how an act's being wrong in the sense described can provide a reason not to do it" (1998: 153).

<sup>20</sup> For a defense of "particularism" in ethics, see Dancy 1993, 2001, and 2004. John McDowell (1979) is another influential source of the idea that ethical ideas, especially those relating to the virtues, are uncodifiable.

wrong are, in their nature, bases for public expectations, for what we justifiably expect of one another. So they must be able to be publicly articulated and accessible.21 It would be unreasonable to hold people accountable to standards whose application required some special sensibility ordinary moral agents could not be assumed to have or that could not be formulated in ways that ordinary agents can understand. In this way, standards of moral right are a moral "law," modeled on law as we generally understand it.

It is notable that this idea also plays an important role even in the utilitarian tradition, although it is often in conflict with other strains. It is, again, a strength of contractualism that its rule- or principle-regarding character complements its deepest (non-outcome-based) justification of principles. Mill's thesis that right and wrong essentially involves moral responsibility has been a recurrent theme in this book. Much less wellappreciated or even known is that a major argument of Bentham's for the principle of utility also derives from the role he thinks moral principles of right play in public directive criticism.22 Bentham (1962) argues that to play that role, any principle must be able to be publicly advanced on some "extrinsic ground" or "external standard," by which he means some reason that supports the principle that one can be expected to accept without already accepting the principle (or sharing the sensibility that it codifies). The argument occurs in the midst of his critique of what he regards as the many ethical philosophies that reject this constraint, whether they champion moral sense, rational intuition, common sense, or whatever.

The various systems that have been formed concerning the standard of right and wrong all of them [consist] in so many contrivances for avoiding the obligation of appealing to any external standard. (Bentham 1962: 8)

Any such theory, Bentham argues, is guilty of simply "prevailing upon the reader to accept of the author's sentiment or opinion as a reason for

<sup>21</sup> This I take it, is the correct response to the criticism that Rawls's constraint that the parties to the original position choose candidate principles as public principles of justice begs the question against utilitarianism. Although this condition may seem ad hoc when considered in relation to ethics more generally, it is utterly central to any adequate theory of moral right to which we are appropriately held publicly accountable.

<sup>22</sup> For a more extended discussion, see Darwall 1994, which I draw on here. For relevant discussion concerning the broader context of liberal democratic moral debate, Railton 1992.

itself" (1962: 9). Bentham's concern is not with some merely intellectual fault, like begging the question.

The mischief common to all these ways of thinking and arguing (which, in truth, as we have seen, are but one and the same method, couched in different forms of words) is their serving as a cloke, and pretence, and aliment, to despotism; if not a despotism in practice, a despotism however in disposition: which is but too apt, when pretence and power offer, to show itself in practice. (1962: 9n)23

Bentham's worry is rather that putting forward a principle of right without an external standard amounts to coercion. It is to make demands of others that they cannot reasonably be expected to accept. And Bentham's case for the principle of utility is that it can be applied uncontroversially, since it turns on empirically ascertainable facts, and that it can be expected to motivate since it concerns the "two sovereign masters" of human motivation, pleasure and pain.24

This line may be somewhat unexpected in Bentham since it grounds the principle of utility in constraints on public directive ("demanding") discourse and practice on distinctly liberal grounds, rather than vice versa. But Bentham makes it clear that he intends precisely this (in this strain of argument, at least). Whether a "moral sentiment" might "be originally conceived" or "upon examination and reflection . . . be actually persisted in and justified on another ground" than "a view of utility" is, he says, something about which he neither knows nor cares. "It matters not, comparatively speaking, how they are decided." But whether in "point of right [a principle of right] can properly be justified on any other ground, by a person addressing himself to a community," is a "question of practice," the answer to which "is of as much importance as that of any can be" (1962: 9n).

### **Vindicating the Reasonable**

As Rawls and Scanlon employ it, 'reasonable' expresses a different concept than does 'rational' or 'normative reason'; it refers to the putative nor-

<sup>24</sup> This is the deep connection between positive social science and liberal moral and political theory.

<sup>23</sup> Also, concerning someone who would put forward "his own *unfounded* sentiments" (i.e., unfounded in an extrinsic ground), Bentham says, "let him ask himself whether his principle is not despotical" (1962: 3).

mative reasons that are distinctively associated with the claims we have the (second-personal) standing to make on one another as equal free and rational persons. Recall the Rawlsian dictum: persons are "self-originating sources of valid claims" (Rawls 1980: 546). (It follows, I believe, that 'reasonable' expresses a second-personal concept.) So in arguing that presuppositions of the second-person standpoint vindicate the equal dignity of persons, I have also been arguing that these vindicate the normativity of the reasonable.

Now, as I mentioned briefly in Chapter 1, Scanlon understands the problem of vindicating morality's authority to be that of explaining "the *priority* of right and wrong over other values," or of explaining their special "importance" (Scanlon 1998: 146, 147). In his original paper, Scanlon (1982) took the view that the "motivational basis" of contractualist morality is a desire to act in a way that can be justified to others. In *What We Owe to Each Other,* however, Scanlon takes a different approach, largely because of his skepticism there that desire can ground reasons for acting of any kind.25 Far from its being the case that reasons for acting are grounded in desires, he there argues, it is closer to the truth to say that desires typically respond to apparent reasons. In "the directedattention sense," a desire involves having one's attention "directed insistently toward considerations that present themselves as counting in favor of" what one desires (and, hence, of a desire for it) (Scanlon 1998: 39–41).

Scanlon's more recent argument for the priority of right has complexities we cannot fully pursue here.26 Its basis, however, is what Scanlon calls the "value" and "appeal" of standing to others in the relation of mutual recognition, both in itself and as an ineliminable aspect of valuable relations like friendship (1998: 158–168). It is because this value gives us (better, in "buck-passing" fashion, consists in) "reason[s] we have to live with others on terms that they could not reasonably reject insofar as they also are motivated by this ideal" that "we have reason to attend to the question of which actions are right and wrong" (154).27 Scanlon likens this to Mill's position in *Utilitarianism* that although the criterion or standard of right is provided by the greatest happiness of all, the moral

<sup>25</sup> For other arguments along similar lines, see Bond 1983; Dancy 2000; Darwall 1983; Hampton 1998; Pettit and Smith 1990; Quinn 1991.

<sup>26</sup> See especially Scanlon's description of the "three-part strategy" (1998: 166–168).

<sup>27</sup> For the "buck-passing" analysis of value, see Scanlon 1998: 11, 95–100.

"sanction" (Mill's term for what makes considerations of right reasongiving for us) is "the desire to be in social unity with our fellow creatures" (Mill 1998: ch. 3; Scanlon 1998: 154). Roughly, for Mill, it is because of the desirability of living in unity with others that considerations of right (which are themselves based indirectly on the general happiness) give us reasons to act. Similarly, for Scanlon, it is because of the value or appeal that we take living with others on terms of mutual recognition and respect to have that considerations of right (and, relatedly, of what is reasonable) are reason-giving and, indeed, have priority for us.

There is, however, a problem with Mill's position that will infect any contractualist position that is modeled too closely upon it. Considerations of desirability, as we have seen throughout this book, are simply reasons of the wrong kind to ground (second-personal) reasons of moral obligation and right. If, consequently, the reasons we have to stand in relations of mutual recognition with others are only that it is desirable that we do so (either impartially or from our own point of view), then, no matter how weighty these reasons may be, they cannot ground the distinctive (second-personal) reasons of moral right. The most they can ground, again, is the desire to be such as to recognize the validity of moral claims; they can give us no reason to accept or recognize moral claims in their own terms.

There are actually two problems here, each connected respectively, to different aspects of moral obligation that, I have argued, are interrelated: moral obligation's (purported) supremacy or superiority, on the one hand, and its tie to mutual accountability, on the other.28 The first problem is that it is hard to see how, from the fact it would be desirable for us to treat considerations of right as having priority over other values (including the desirable), it can possibly follow that such considerations actually have this priority. The second problem, yet another reflection of Strawson's Point, is that it is hard to see how its being desirable that we relate to one another on terms of mutual accountability can possibly ground the distinctively second-personal claim that we are mutually accountable.

For the value of relating to one another on terms of mutual respect to be connected in the right way to the reasons we appeal to within such

<sup>28</sup> The relation, again, is that it is because of moral obligation's essential tie to mutual accountability that its reasons must purport to be supreme. For this argument, see Chapter 5.

relations, we must see this respect as itself called for by the equal dignity of free and rational persons. It is this, I have argued, that most deeply underlies the rationale for a contractualist procedure and that we are committed to from the second-person standpoint. The reason we have for relating to others with respect is not just that this is desirable in some way or other, whether for us individually, or impartially, or whatever, but, the dignity of persons pure and simple, their having equal second-personal standing, which we are committed to accepting when we address them second-personally at all.29 In presupposing this, I have argued, we must presuppose that we have the standing to lay claims on one another as free and rational, where this means both that we cannot treat one another as mere means and that we are accountable to one another for not doing so.

It is the reciprocal recognition that is always already implicit in second-personal address that gets us into the space of the reasonable and justification to one another. Consider two naïve agents, *A* and *B,* reasoning first-personally on the basis of their respective evaluations of the desirability of outcomes as these are given in their desires and other practical experience. Suppose, for example, that *A* and *B* both desire the same apple and both see their desire for the apple as evidence that it would really be good for them to have it, respectively. At this point, neither *A* nor *B* will see the other's desire, will, or agency as a source of reasons for him, but neither will each see his own will and agency in this way either. From this naïve perspective, their agency and will are deliberatively "backgrounded" (Pettit and Smith 1990). What is foregrounded for both is the desirability of the objects of their respective desires, as it seems to them under their desires' influence. For *A:* my (*A*'s) having the apple would be good (desirable). For *B:* my (*B*'s) having the apple would be good (desirable).

Suppose that at this point, *A* attempts to give *B* a reason to let him, *A,* have the apple by expressing his desire, saying that his (*A*'s) having the apple would be a valuable outcome, a state that should be brought about (noting that, so far as he can tell, *B*'s having it is not). This will probably not succeed, since from *B*'s perspective, there may be, so far as she can see, nothing to be said for *A*'s having the apple and everything

<sup>29</sup> With the usual caveats about children and other nonstandard cases, impure address, and so on.

to be said for her (*B*'s) having it. *B* may have no reason to trust *A*'s judgment, since, from *B*'s perspective *A*'s judgment may simply seem illusory, a mere expression of *A*'s desire. Any such attempt of *A*'s to give *B* a reason would be structurally analogous to theoretical reason-giving. It could succeed only if *B* has some reason to think there exists some evidentiary relation between A's judgment and the normative world it purports to represent.

At the same time, however, *A*'s expression of desire might give *B* pause in the credit she accords her own desire's appearance. From a first-person perspective, corrected only by further appearances that come with better informed desires and unchallenged by another's desires and will, *B* could comfortably credit the epistemic access she apparently got to reasons through her own desires. But now she sees that *A*'s desires appear to him to provide access to reasons no less than do *B*'s for her.

To be sure, there are ways that *A* and *B*'s conversation could progress within the space of (apparently) outcome-based reasons. *A* or *B* could come to care about the other through sympathetic concern and see the other's welfare (and, consequently, the other's having the apple) as a good thing. Or they might come to regard the practical experiences and desires of the other as no less evidentiary of desirable outcomes than their own. Any of these reasons, however, can only show why it would be a good thing for *A* or *B* or both to have the apple in whole or in part. It could not show why either might have a reasonable claim to the apple, whole or part, or show, consequently, why any particular disposition of the apple might be reasonable.30 In particular, abstracting from phenomena like diminishing marginal utility, nothing would recommend dividing the apple between them. And certainly there would be no place for the idea that either has any moral obligation, even *pro tanto,* to give any weight to the other's interest (or, indeed, to his own).

Suppose now that *A* lays a claim of any kind to the apple (or some part of it or chance for it) and addresses it second-personally to *B.* No matter what the basis of *A*'s claim is, *A* thereby presupposes a second-personal relation to *B. A* presupposes the standing to address the specific claim he makes, on whatever basis, and, therefore, a second-personal authority to make claims on another person at all. And if *B* takes up the claim, if only by giving it consideration publicly between them, then *B*

<sup>30</sup> I am indebted here to conversation with Mark van Roojen.

implicitly acknowledges *A*'s second-personal authority, even if she rejects, on reflection, *A*'s specific claim. But likewise, in addressing his claim to *B, A* must simultaneously presuppose *B*'s second-personal authority. Finally, in acknowledging a claim or second-personal summons from *A,B* must also acknowledge, and presuppose in her practical reasoning, her own second-personal authority as a free and rational agent.

In the reciprocal recognition of the second-person standpoint, addresser and addressee are committed alike to their mutual accountability as equal free and rational persons, and this commits them to the demand for justification to one another, at least within the scope of their mutual accountability. Their reciprocal address commits them both also to a constraint of reasonableness of any demands they address; they must be able to expect their addressees to accept, or not reasonably to reject, their demands as free and rational persons, in light of their interest as independent, mutually accountable (second-personally competent) agents. It commits them both to imposing no demands on others that they would not also be prepared to impose upon themselves from a common standpoint they share as free and rational.

The second-person standpoint thus vindicates the reasonable and so grounds contractualist moral theory. By presupposing the equal dignity of persons, it commits us to contractualism's deepest idea: a community of mutually accountable free and rational persons.31 And in so doing, it gives us a reason of the right kind to comply with principles that mediate respect between mutually accountable equals.

<sup>31</sup> Elizabeth Anderson (1999) proposes what she calls a "relational theory of equality" along these lines. I am much indebted to her work.
