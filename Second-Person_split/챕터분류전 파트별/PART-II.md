## 4. Accountability and the Second Person

In this chapter and the next, I begin to put forward my main arguments for the claim that moral obligation is essentially second-personal. At this point, this is primarily a thesis about the *form* of moral obligation: that moral demands are essentially tied to second-personal accountability. (Ultimately, it includes a claim about moral obligation's *content:* that it at least partly derives from our equal dignity as free and rational persons.) This chapter focuses on the second-personal character of moral accountability. In the next, I discuss the connection between accountability and moral obligation.

In his famous essay, "Freedom and Resentment" (1968), P. F. Strawson argued influentially against consequentialist compatibilist views that hold that determinism poses no threat to practices of moral responsibility since these can be fully justified by their "efficacy . . . in regulating behaviour in socially desirable ways" (72).1 Punishment is justified by its incentive and deterrence effects, and, although standard excuses can be given a similar rationale, there is no corresponding warrant for excusing an act just because it was caused. Wrongs done in utter ignorance or under extreme duress are appropriately excused, since punishment under those conditions cannot deter. But there is obviously no consequentialist justification for treating determinism as an excuse generally.

Against these approaches, Strawson argued that social desirability cannot provide a justification of "the right *sort*" for practices of moral responsibility "as we understand them" (1968: 74). When we seek to hold

<sup>1</sup> Strawson's example of such a view was Nowell-Smith 1948. A classic statement is Schlick 1939.

people accountable, what matters is not whether punishment is pragmatically desirable, either in a particular case or in general, but whether it is deserved and we have the authority to mete it out. Desirability is a reason of the wrong kind to warrant the attitudes and actions in which holding someone responsible consists in their own terms. This is *Strawson's Point.*

As we noted in Chapter 1, Strawson's Point is an instance of the *wrong kind of reason problem.* Pragmatic considerations for belief do not make a proposition credible; moral reasons against being amused do not undermine a joke's humor; and considerations of the desirability—whether personal, social, or even moral—of holding someone responsible do not make him blameworthy for what he did.2 In each case, the right kind of reasons for warranting the relevant attitude in its own terms must derive from distinctive norms for attitudes of that kind: for belief, for amusement, and for the attitudes and actions that are distinctively involved in holding people responsible. It must be a fact about or feature of an object, appropriate consideration of which could provide the basis (someone's reason) for a warranted attitude of that kind toward the object.3 It is impossible to come to believe some proposition *p* by reflecting on the fact that it would be desirable to believe *p,* (devilishly) impossible to find something unfunny (though possible to have one's sense of humor stilled) by considering the moral offensiveness of finding it so, and impossible also to feel guilty or to resent a wrong by reflecting on the desirability (personal, social, or moral) of having these feelings.

We can see these points by reflecting on the class of responses that Strawson famously termed "reactive attitudes," which he held to be essential to human practices of moral responsibility. Strawson distinguishes two kinds—"participant" and "impersonal"—both of which respond to "transactions" between individuals (1968: 74). *Participant (*or *personal) reactive attitudes* are those, in the first instance, of individuals in the transactions themselves—the *transagents*—although participant attitudes

<sup>2</sup> See Chapter 1, note 31.

<sup>3</sup> Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen put essentially the same point by saying reasons of the right kind also appear in the content of the attitude for which they are reasons: the attitude is toward something "on account of" these reasons (Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen 2004: 414). As W. D. Falk pointed out, a favoring that is relevant to value is "by way of true comprehension of what [the object] is like" (1986: 117). See also Derek Parfit's distinction between "object-given" and "state-given" reasons (2001).

can also be had by relevant others "on their behalf" as if from their point of view. Strawson's examples include gratitude, resentment, forgiveness, love, and hurt feelings (72). *Impersonal reactive attitudes* are "impersonal or disinterested or generalized analogues" of these, including moral indignation, disapprobation, and, when the object is oneself, feelings of obligation, guilt, compunction, and remorse (84–85). Impersonal reactive attitudes are felt, not as if from the transagents' standpoints, but as from an impartial standpoint: the moral point of view. For example, resentment is felt as from the perspective of a wronged or injured individual, but indignation is felt as from the standpoint of the moral community.

I claim that reactive attitudes are always implicitly second-personal and that they therefore invariably carry presuppositions of second-personal address about the competence and authority of the individuals who are their targets, as well as about those who have them.4 Personal reactive attitudes are felt as if from the second-person standpoint of a relevant transagent, and impersonal reactive attitudes are felt as from the standpoint of members of the moral community. It will follow that reasons that can warrant these attitudes—that can be reasons of the right kind must be second-personal reasons.

Consider indignation, for example. To feel indignation toward someone is to feel that he is to blame for wrongful conduct and therefore appropriately held accountable for what he has done, even if only by being subject to reactive attitudes from himself and others. Moreover, and this is part of Strawson's Point, indignation differs from its seeming that a sanction would be desirable, or even that some evil's befalling him would make for a more valuable or fitting whole (poetic justice). The feeling of

<sup>4</sup> Michelle Mason makes what I take to be a similar claim, saying that there is a sense in "which it is true that all the reactive attitudes are in fact moral attitudes: namely, the sense in which it is true that to regard one as within the scope of the particular reactive attitude is to regard one as answerable to an expectation or demand that forms part of a system of expectations, demands and rights the regulation in accordance with which it is necessary for aspiring to moral community with us" (2003: 244). Mason makes a persuasive case that at least a form of contempt should also be understood as a reactive attitude. It is a particularly interesting case, since, as Mason argues, although it presupposes a background demand on its object as a person, it may not seem to address the demand, since its natural expression is a form of withdrawal. I think, however, that contempt of the sort she is discussing must, if it is to be a reactive attitude as she claims, presuppose that the withdrawal is a way of holding its object accountable and not a non-"reactive" response like, say, disgust, or, indeed, like other forms of contempt.

indignation invariably includes a sense of authoritative demand that may be absent from the feeling that something would be desirable or fitting. Consider what beliefs moderate or undermine indignation. If we come to believe that someone does not deserve blame, say, because he could not possibly have known the true character of what he was doing or because he was under extreme duress, then this will reduce or even defeat our indignation toward him. But if we learn that attempting to hold him accountable would be undesirable, say, because it will provoke him further, this will hardly undermine indignation.

Similar points hold for personal reactive attitudes. Resentment, for instance, is felt in response to apparent injustice, as if from the victim's point of view. We resent what we take to be violations against ourselves or those with whom we identify. If you resent someone's treading on your foot or, even more, his rejecting your request or demand that he stop doing so, you feel as if he has violated a valid claim or demand and as if some claim-exacting or responsibility-seeking response by you, or on your behalf, is justified. What you feel is not just (or even) that this response would be justified as an effective or desirable means to desirable relief. And although you might think that some such response would make for a more morally fitting whole, that thought is not itself part of resentment. Resentment seems rather to be warranted simply by the other's conduct and by what you and he can validly, that is, authoritatively, claim and demand of one another. "You can't do that to me," you might think, referring, not to your respective power, but to your authority.

Strawson argues that appreciating the role of reactive attitudes in moral responsibility is of central relevance to the problem of free will. The question of whether, and how, to hold others responsible is one that arises within human relationships (that is, relatings) in which we are disposed, through reactive attitudes, to presume an authority to hold others to expectations that we take to define those relations.5 In a slogan: The moral sense of 'responsible for' is conceptually tied to 'responsible to' (whether to individuals or to one another as members of the moral community).6

<sup>5</sup> This is also a theme that Scanlon sounds in Scanlon 1995.

<sup>6</sup> More cautiously, as far as the concept of moral responsibility is concerned, it is tied to responsibility to those with the authority to hold morally responsible (the moral community). In the next chapter, I argue that theological voluntarism and Kantian views provide competing conceptions of the moral community, respectively, as God and as all free and rational agents (the realm of ends).

Responsibility distinctively concerns how, in light of what someone has done, she is to be related to, that is, regarded and addressed (including by herself) within the second-personal relationships we stand in as members of the moral community. To keep this point before us, I will usually use the term 'accountable' rather than 'responsible', since there are senses of 'responsible' that differ from the sense that I have in mind. For example, 'responsible' can refer to causal responsibility regardless of moral implications, and there are broader senses even of moral responsibility, for example, what is sometimes called "responsibility as attributability," that differ from the distinctive kind of moral responsibility, "responsibility as accountability," with which we are concerned.7 My point is that holding someone responsible in this latter sense is ineliminably second-personal.

Strawson contrasts "the attitude (or range of attitudes) of involvement or participation in a human relationship," that is, a second-person stance, on the one hand, with "the objective attitudes (or range of attitudes) to another human being, on the other" (1968: 79). We take an "objective" attitude toward those we see as unfit for "ordinary adult human relationships," such as very young children and those with "deep-rooted psychological abnormality," and regard them as appropriately subject to "treatment" or "management" rather than to reactive attitudes and forms of interpersonal address that involve them (1968: 81).8 Consequently, the real issue that determinism poses is whether accepting it "could, or should . . . lead us always to look on everyone exclusively in this [objective] way" (81). Strawson famously holds that it could not.

Our interest in this chapter is not so much free will as the nature of moral accountability, specifically, its second-personal character. Nonetheless, it is worth noting the connection between these. If Strawson is right,

<sup>7</sup> On the distinction, see Watson 1996. The former sense concerns what we can credit someone with in a way that is relevant to broader forms of evaluation that need not be second-personal at all. For example, warranted pride may depend upon whether I am responsible for something concerning me in this sense, and this need involve no warranted claim or demand. See also, Scanlon 1998: 248f. Scanlon calls the sense I have in mind "substantive responsibility." I am indebted here to discussion with Andrew Eshelman, Lei Zhong, Jim Staihar, and Susan Wolf.

<sup>8</sup> Obviously, this raises many issues about matters of degree, responsibility and disability, and respect and treatment of those we are not prepared to hold fully responsible. I cannot begin to deal adequately with these here. For most of these purposes of this chapter, all we need to focus on are clear cases in both categories (i.e., those who are apt for second-personal accountability and those who are not). I return to this issue, again inadequately, at the end of this chapter.

it is only because we view one another in the distinctive second-personal ways we do when we relate to each other that the questions of responsibility (as accountability), freedom of the will, and what might undermine these even arise. The issue of free will gets its grip, therefore, *because we view and address one another (and ourselves) second-personally.* Again: we can be morally responsible (accountable) for what we do in a way that makes free will an issue only because we are morally responsible to one another, that is, because we have the authority to address demands to one another as members of the moral community.9 It is second-personal address (as in reactive attitudes) that commits us to assuming the freedom of addresser and addressee alike.

### **Reactive Responses as a Form of Address**

In the next four sections, I seek to show that reactive attitudes invariably involve:

(a) a form of (second-personal) address,
(b) which presupposes an other's competence and standing to be thus addressed (second-personal competence and authority) and
(c) which responds to the person's conduct
(d) with respect to persons (at least).10

In this section, we are concerned with (a), hence with continuing our consideration of the second-personal character of reactive attitudes themselves. Strawson explicitly says that both personal reactive attitudes and their generalized or vicarious analogues invariably involve "an expectation of, and demand for, the manifestation of a certain degree of goodwill" (1968: 85). Moreover, Strawson's examples can be shown to involve the (at least, implicit) addressing of these demands.11

<sup>9</sup> Note, again, the caveat in the preceding footnote.

<sup>10</sup> See the short discussion of this issue in Chapter 2.

<sup>11</sup> However, Strawson excludes shame. He lists "the more complicated phenomenon of shame" as reactive, although he doesn't say why (1968: 86). For the reasons given in the next paragraph, I think this may be a mistake (at least for non-second-personal forms of shame). Nothing hangs on this for my purposes, however. If Strawson is right and I am wrong, then either there are second-personal aspects of shame I am not appreciating, or there are not, in which case my claims in this chapter can be interpreted as about reactive attitudes other than shame. Of course, shame can figure in reactive attitudes and emotions without itself being reactive. We say, "you ought to be ashamed" in a reactive vein, but here we mean not just that were the person to feel shame she would be accurately representing her shameful state, but that experiencing shame is a psychic state that she should undergo or experience because of what she has done. In such contexts, shame is functioning as a sanction. Moreover, there is such a thing as moral shame, namely shame at one's conduct or character. But although moral shame is essentially concerned with persons as objects, it is not reactive in the sense of being characteristically addressed second-personally. I have been helped here by discussion with John Deigh, and by Deigh 1983. See also Mason unpublished.

Consider, for example, the difference between guilt and shame. Guilt is a reactive attitude. To feel guilty is to feel as if one is appropriately blamed (to blame) and held responsible for something one has done.12 Guilt feels like the appropriate (second-personal) response to blame: an acknowledgment of one's blameworthiness that recognizes both the grounds of blame and, more importantly for us, the authority to level it (even if only "to God"). To feel guilt, consequently, is to feel as if one has the requisite capacity and standing to be addressed as responsible, and this puts it in tension with a purely "objective" view of oneself in Strawson's sense. Finally, guilt's natural expressions are themselves second-personal—confession, apology, making amends, and self-addressed reproach.

Like guilt, shame feels as if one is rightly regarded or seen in a certain way. But here the relevant regard is not second-personal; it is third-personal. One sees oneself as an object of the other's regard or "gaze"—of her disdain, perhaps, or of her just seeing through one's public persona to something one is ashamed to have seen.13 Sartre famously remarked that "I can be ashamed only as my freedom escapes me in order to become a *given* object" for the other (1957: 260).14 To feel guilt, by contrast, is to feel oneself authoritatively addressed as free. The "view from

<sup>12</sup> On this point, see Greenspan 1992. For other elements of the contrast between guilt and shame, see Gibbard 1990, ch. 7; Morris 1976; Rawls 1971, secs. 67, 70–75; Williams 1993: 89–90; and Wollheim 1984. For a contrasting view, see Stocker, forthcoming. An especially interesting discussion of guilt can be found in Buber 1965. I am indebted to David Levy for this reference.

<sup>13</sup> For a fascinating discussion of shame that stresses the latter element, see Velleman 2001. Another example of a reaction that isn't a reactive attitude is disgust. See Miller 1997.

<sup>14</sup> As Paul Hoffman has pointed out to me, at least some kinds of shame (certainly moral shame, and perhaps others) involve a feeling not just of recognizing a third-person regard, say, disdain, but also of struggling against it agentially. Arguably this is involved in the kind of shame Sartre is discussing. The point remains that even shame of this kind responds as if to a third-person view rather a second-person address.

guilt," as we might call it, is incompatible with a purely "objective" view of oneself in Strawson's sense. One feels that one should and could have done what one didn't do and, therefore, feels appropriately blamed for that reason. And whereas guilt's characteristic expression is second-personal, shame inhibits second-personal engagement—one feels like escaping from view.

Shame and guilt both give an imagined other's regard authority. But the authority shame accords is fundamentally epistemic and third-personal. One sees the other as having standing to see one in a certain way (and oneself as correctly thus seen). Guilt, however, recognizes an irreducibly second-personal practical authority of the sort we noted at the outset. It acknowledges the authority to make a demand, that is, to address a second-personal reason for acting.

Consider now the rest of Strawson's examples.15 His exemplary participant or personal reactive responses are, again, gratitude, resentment, love, forgiveness, and hurt feelings. Resentment and forgiveness are perhaps the easiest cases. Resentment is felt as if in response to a violation of a legitimate claim or expectation, and not simply as directed toward the violator, but as implicitly addressing her. This is what makes resentment "reactive" rather than "objective." It is a form of "holding responsible," an address of the other as a person with the capacity and standing to be addressed in this way and charged. If it turns out, for example, that someone's foot has been forced on top of yours by the shifting of a heavy package on a careening bus on which you both are traveling, knowing that might not change your desire to get his foot off of yours, but it will lessen your resentment or perhaps redirect it to a new object (the driver).

Forgiveness's second-personal character is most easily understood in relation to resentment. To forgive is, roughly, to forbear or withdraw resentment.16 Forgiveness acknowledges the other's responsibility for wronging one, but refrains from pressing claims or "holding it against" him.17 Of course, one can forgive or feel forgiveness without communicating it. But forgiveness nevertheless functions within the second-

<sup>15</sup> Again, excluding shame.

<sup>16</sup> The classic statement of this position is by Bishop Butler. See Butler 1900: sermon numbers VIII and IX. See also Murphy and Hampton 1988.

<sup>17</sup> Above we noted that resentment can be felt for injuries to those with whom one identifies. Similarly, it is possible to forgive injuries to those with whom one identifies.

personal space of holding responsible. If there were no such thing as resentment, indignation, and their kin, there would be no such thing as forgiveness.

Gratitude is like forgiveness in being parasitic on legitimate claims or expectations. We are appropriately grateful when people benefit us or act as we wish when we lack any relevant claim or expectation of them. Gratitude is felt, moreover, in response to an action by a responsible agent. It is true that we speak of being grateful for good weather, for example, but this evidently involves the conceit that the weather is a free gift, as if from God.18 And gratitude's natural expression is also second-personal, a grateful addressing of the benefactor that reciprocally recognizes that he has benefited us beyond what we had any claim to expect. "You shouldn't have done that," we say, but we clearly don't mean to be finding fault. Finally, unaddressed (or, more certainly, unexperienced) feelings of gratitude can themselves be ungrateful.

Strawson's examples of "love" and "hurt feelings" may seem less straightforwardly second-personal. Surely there are forms of love that are not second-personal at all. One can care deeply for nonpersons, and caring for persons need not show itself in even imagined address nor be seen as essentially responsive to their conduct. Most love may not be entirely unconditional, but it needn't be second-personally conditional. Pretty clearly what Strawson has in mind, however, are loving or other friendly relations that are maintained by reciprocally recognizing mutual address. And hurt feelings must be understood within that same framework. Feelings are hurt when people act in ways that seem contrary to expected personal regard, where one takes the other reciprocally to have recognized the expectations or takes it that he should have done so. One need not see oneself as having a claim to the other's regard that would warrant resentment.19 But one feels as if some issue of rejection and mutual trust has been raised.

<sup>18</sup> It may, however, be beneficial to live with this conceit. On this point, see Emmons and McCullough 2003. Is this more evidence of second-personal psychological mechanisms? On this, see Chapter 7.

<sup>19</sup> Although this obviously can happen also, as with Medea's response to Jason's leaving her for the Princess of Corinth or, as in the lyrics of Alanis Morissette's "You Oughta Know" (1995): "And I'm here to remind you / Of the mess you left when you went away. / It's not fair to deny me / Of the cross I bear that you gave to me / You, you, you...

That leaves us with Strawson's examples of impersonal reactive feelings, both the other-addressed ones—moral indignation and disapprobation and those that are self-addressed: guilt, compunction, and remorse. Here we can be brief. Moral indignation is a feeling that someone is rightly held responsible for some conduct and is itself part of holding him thus accountable. As Strawson points out, we feel indignation and disapprobation when we feel we can demand, as members of the moral community, that people act in certain ways. Indeed, Strawson says, "the making of the demand *is* the proneness to such attitudes" (1968: 92– 93).20 This is an important point that we need to bear in mind: we address moral demands partly by its being common knowledge that we are prone to impersonal (but still second-personal) "demanding" attitudes and to more explicit ways of holding one another responsible.

These same points hold also with reflexive impersonal reactive attitudes. In these cases, however, the demands are self-addressed, as has been illustrated already by guilt. Compunction and remorse seem relevantly similar, if more muted or qualified. As Jonathan Bennett points out, "self-reactive attitudes" involve a kind of "interpersonal relation... between one's present self and some past self" (1980: 44).21

### **Presupposing Second-Personal Competence and Authority**

What gives Strawson's discussion of reactive attitudes its special relevance to the issue of free will is that reactive attitudes invariably address demands, and, as Gary Watson notes, there are "constraints on moral address" that must be presupposed as normative felicity conditions of addressing a demand (1987: 263, 264).22 "To be intelligible," Watson points

oughta know." This also occurs in Bob Dylan's "Desolation Row" (2004: 181–183): "Yes, I received your letter yesterday / (About the time the door knob broke) / When you asked how I was doing / Was that some kind of joke? /.../ Don't send me no more letters no / Not unless you mail them / From Desolation Row."

<sup>20</sup> Compare Hart on Bentham on "quasi-commands" in law. (See Chapter 1, note 17.)

<sup>21</sup> I am grateful to Daniel Keen for this reference.

<sup>22</sup> Note also, R. Jay Wallace: "My main contention is that there is an essential connection between the reactive attitudes and a distinctive form of evaluation... that I refer to as holding a person to an expectation (or demand)" (1994: 19). See also Bennett 1980.

Note should also be taken of similar points in Scanlon (1998: 272–290), since they have a special relevance to our consideration of the way the second-person standpoint can ground a contractualist approach to morality in Chapter 12.

out, "demanding requires understanding on the part of the object of the demand" (264). The point is not that making a demand is unlikely to be effective unless its object has the capacity to understand it. It is rather that reactive attitudes are "forms of communication" that are simply unintelligible in their own terms without the presupposition that their objects can understand what is being said and act on this understanding.23 The point is an Austinian one about the felicity conditions of a speech or quasi-speech act (transposed, albeit to a normative key). Even if expressing reactive attitudes to those who lack the requisite capacity, like very young children or the insane, causes them to behave desirably, reactive attitudes there "lose their point as forms of moral address" (265). The effectiveness of moral address is a matter of perlocutionary force, whereas addressees' having (and being assumed to have) the capacity to recognize and act on second-personal reasons is, I claim, a felicity condition of its distinctive (normative) illocutionary force. More precisely relevant to our point, it is a normative felicity condition of the relevant second-personal reasons' existing and being successfully given through address.

Again, one need not believe that someone one addresses has the requisite capacity and standing. The point is rather that moral address presupposes these things. Watson is saying that we address others on the assumption that they can understand and be guided by what we are saying. And I am adding that what we presuppose in second-personal address is *second-personal competence,*24 that those we address can guide themselves by a reciprocal recognition of the second-personal reasons we address and our authority to address them, that they can take a second-personal perspective on themselves and act on reasons they accept from that point of view (by making the relevant demands of themselves).25

<sup>23</sup> Watson remarks, as we noted above, that the communicative (second-personal) character of reactive attitudes does not mean that they are "usually communicated; very often, in fact, they are not. Rather the most appropriate and direct expression of resentment is to address the other with a complaint and a demand" (1987: 265).

<sup>24</sup> The moral competence requisite for (equal) membership in the moral community (second-personal competence) is what Rawls calls a "range property." In this sense, people are not more or less competent members of the moral community, since everyone who is within the range is equally within the range. On this point, see Rawls 1971: 508.

<sup>25</sup> There are very interesting issues that I cannot do justice to here concerning autism and related conditions that involve deficits in empathy and hence in second-personal competence. Jeanette Kennett (2002) has argued that people with high functioning autism are indeed capable of moral responsibility and that this supports a Kantian rather than a Humean picture of moral agency. It does seem correct that high functioning autism is consistent with highly principled conduct. If I am right, the Categorical Imperative and related moral principles should be understood in fundamentally second-personal terms. Nonetheless, it could still turn out that, even though high functioning autism may be inconsistent with a full appreciation of fundamental moral motivations and the basis for principles of moral obligation, those with this condition might still reliably determine their conduct by these principles and so be able to function as members of the moral community. Of course, I have been emphasizing that being guided by certain norms does not yet acknowledge the second-personal authority that is essential to moral responsibility. But there might be ways of reliably tracking these more properly second-personal aspects also. I am indebted here to Walter Sinnott-Armstrong.

It is important to my main constructive argument that addressing any second-personal reason through a claim or demand invariably presupposes that the addressee can recognize its validity and (freely) act on the reason through this recognition. If you express resentment to someone for not moving his foot from on top of yours, you implicitly demand that he do so. And any second-personal reason you implicitly address presupposes, first, that he can recognize the validity of your demand and, second, that he can move his foot simply by recognizing a conclusive reason for acting deriving from your authoritative demand (whether or not, it is worth noting, you have his sympathy). And if I express indignation as a disinterested bystander, I too must make these assumptions. A putatively authoritative demand whose validity someone cannot possibly recognize and act on is guaranteed to be infelicitous. The point is not, again, that such a demand cannot achieve compliance. It may well, but that is a matter of its perlocutionary force. It is that the address is guaranteed to fail in (normative) illocutionary terms, that is, as an addressing of an authoritative demand or second-personal reason.26 The second-personal competence of the addressee is a normative felicity condition of second-personal address in general.

Claiming or demanding is not just calling some claim or demand to someone's attention. It is addressing a distinctively second-personal kind of reason to another person that aims to direct his will, but in a way that

<sup>26</sup> At this point, I am not so much arguing for this as claiming it. Part of the argument for the claim, of course, is the claim's role in an overall picture of second-personal address and reasons that I will hope will seem compelling and able to explain significant ethical phenomena. More focused arguments come, however, with the presentation of Fichte's Point in Chapter 10.

recognizes his authority and independent practical reasoning. As Strawson emphasizes, to respond to another's conduct with a reactive attitude is "to view him as a member of the moral community; only as one who offended against its demands" (1968: 93).27 Reactive attitudes are thus unlike critical attitudes of other forms, disdain, for example, that presuppose no authority on the part of their objects. I believe that the role of second-personal attitudes and the second-person stance in mediating (mutual) accountability in Kantian and contractualist ethical conceptions marks a deep difference with the ethical views (frequently ethics of virtue) of thinkers like Plato, Aristotle, Hume, and Nietzsche (to give four prominent, but quite different, examples), for whom evaluation of conduct and character does not take a fundamentally second-personal form.28

We should be clear about the kind of freedom that second-personal address presupposes. Beings may be capable of other varieties of free choice but still lack the distinctively second-personal *moral freedom* we presuppose in reactive attitudes. When we respond reactively to someone who fails to respect a moral demand, we attribute to her the capacity to act on the distinctive kind of reason, second-personal reason, that is connected to the authoritative demand.

Imagine, for example, a being with what the Cambridge Platonist Ralph Cudworth (1670) called "animal free will."29 Such a being, Cudworth thought, might have the ability critically to revise its desires, make an assessment of what is likeliest to satisfy informed desires in the long run, and act on this assessment.30 Cudworth agrees that incentives could be devised so that a being with animal free will could conform its conduct to a law of conduct. But he holds that such beings could not be under genuine moral obligation, that is, be authentically subject to a moral demand, if they are unable to recognize these demands as intrinsically

<sup>27</sup> This is also, I believe, the grain of truth in Hegel's famous idea of a "right to punishment" (1991: 126–127); that is, failure to hold someone accountable can be a failure to respect his dignity as a rational person.

<sup>28</sup> See Korsgaard 1996a for an excellent discussion of this aspect of the Kantian framework.

<sup>29</sup> This appears in his unpublished manuscripts on freedom of the will, held in the British Library. References will be to manuscript number and page number. I discuss these in Darwall 1995a: 109–148.

<sup>30</sup> This is roughly the kind of self-determination that Locke defends in the *Essay* (1975). I discuss Locke's conception in relation to his theory of moral obligation in Darwall 1995a: 149–175.

reason-giving (and so lack "moral free will"). To be genuinely morally responsible, and therefore capable of being morally obligated, a being must be capable of holding itself responsible, and it can do that only if it can take a second-personal perspective on itself and recognize and act on authoritative demands. Were beings only to have animal free will, "laws could no otherwise operate or seize upon them than by taking hold of their animal selfish passions . . . and that . . . utterly destroys all morality" (4980, 9).

Reactive attitudes presuppose the capacity to take moral demands as conclusive reasons for acting.31 And this involves the capacity to hold oneself responsible and, I argue, determine oneself by a second-personal reason, that is, an agent-relative reason whose validity is grounded in presupposed normative relations between persons and that is therefore independent of the value of any outcome or state.32 Reactive attitudes therefore implicitly presuppose motivational capacities that are irreducible to evaluations (and associated desires) whose objects are outcomes or states (like those implicated in sympathy). At the minimum, they involve the acceptance of (agent-relative) norms of action, which is an essentially action-regarding state of mind that cannot be reduced to a favorable regard for any state of the world or outcome.33 But it follows further from Strawson's Point that even presupposing just this much is insufficient for second-personal responsibility to be fully intelligible in its own terms. We must also presuppose a distinctively second-personal competence, the ability to take the second-person stance of the moral community on oneself and be motivated by demands that one would sensibly address to anyone from that perspective.

<sup>31</sup> Cudworth calls this "moral free will." Compare Kant: "I can recognize that I am under obligation to others only insofar as I at the same time put myself under obligation" (1996d: 417–418).

<sup>32</sup> See note 16 of Chapter 1. I note there that it is consistent with the idea of second-personal reason that its formulation is actually agent-neutral. What matters is that the reason derives from something fundamentally agent-relative, namely, the agent's place in a network of relations of authoritative claim and demand. It is consistent with this that the reason itself is agent-neutral. Thus, one might argue from the fundamental proposition that every person has an equal claim to happiness, say, that we can reasonably demand that persons follow the principle of utility, which is agent-neutral. Thus, nothing said so far rules out act-consequentialist theories of right. I am indebted here to discussion with Allan Gibbard and Jim Staihar.

<sup>33</sup> See the discussion in Chapter 2 and, especially, in Chapter 7. See also Gibbard 1990 on the mental state of norm acceptance.

*Pufendorf 's Point* amounts to roughly the same thing, as I show at greater length in the next chapter. The pure second-personal address that is involved in moral obligation—as Pufendorf sees it, in God's addressing valid demands to us—requires the assumption that we can hold ourselves responsible through our own acceptance of the requisite authority, rather than just by fear of any sanctions someone with such authority might impose. For actions to be imputable to us as accountable agents, the person to whom we are accountable and we must both assume that we can be moved, not simply by a fear of sanctions that might coerce compliance, but by "acknowledge[ing] of [ourselves] that the evil, which has been pointed out to the person who deviates from an announced rule, falls upon him justly" (Pufendorf 1934: 91). We must be able to blame ourselves as we do in feeling guilt.

A consequence of all this is that we can intelligibly address demands through reactive attitudes only to those we assume able to take the very same attitudes toward themselves. Addressees must be assumed to be able to take a second-person perspective on, and make the same demands of, themselves through acknowledging their validity as in self-reactive attitudes like guilt, and, of course, by appropriately regulating their own practical reasoning. In doing this, they take up the very same point of view that an addresser takes up in holding them responsible. They hold themselves responsible through blaming themselves. In seeing themselves as to blame, they regard themselves as warrantedly blamed from the perspective of a member of the moral community.

### **In Response to His Conduct (as a Person)**

It follows that reactive attitudes respond to an individual's exercise of the very capacities they presuppose: conduct as a person in respecting the demands they address. The object of a reactive attitude is always some individual conceived as free and rational in the sense of one who can recognize, freely accept, and act on the distinctive second-personal reasons the demand addresses. And what the attitude responds to is precisely the individual's exercise of these capacities, how she conducts herself in light of the relevant second-personal reasons. Since these reasons themselves structure second-personal relations, we might say that reactive attitudes respond to how an individual conducts herself *as a second person.* They respond to how she relates to and conducts herself (second-personally) toward those with the authority to make claims and demands

of her. Since, as I argue in Chapters 6 and 10, both respect for someone's dignity as a person and, indeed, the dignity itself, are essentially second-personal phenomena, it will follow that *the veryconcept of person is itself a second-personal concept.*34

### **(At Least Partly) With Respect to Persons**

Reactive attitudes thus concern themselves not with a person's overall agency, but specifically with his conduct with respect to claims or demands that other persons have standing to make of him.35 They respond, that is, not simply to how he regards, or acts regarding, others, but to how he respects others in the sense of recognizing their valid claims and demands along with their authority to make them. They respond to how he conducts himself second-personally.

In this way, reactive attitudes always concern a form of respect that we realize when we relate to someone second-personally and acknowledge a second-personal reason and the authority relations that ground it, whether through the reactive attitudes themselves or by regulating our practical reasoning in the ways they call for. I return to the relation between respect and second-personal reasons in Chapter 6.

### **(At Least Apparently) Nonmoral Cases**

To this point, we have been considering reactive attitudes in distinctively moral contexts. One might think, however, that reactive attitudes, at least personal ones, can figure also in nonmoral cases. If the sergeant's troops refuse to fall in when she orders them to, she is apt to resent this, and although her resentment will presuppose a demand that her charges can recognize and act on, it may seem a distortion to view her authority as moral. Nonetheless, it is clear enough that she must presuppose *de jure*

<sup>34</sup> Compare here Locke's idea, discussed in the next chapter, that 'person' is a "forensick term," that is, one essentially connected to imputing legal or moral responsibility (1975: 386).

<sup>35</sup> It is consistent with this, again, that some such demands we make of one another as members of the moral community concern how persons are to conduct themselves also toward non-persons, whether infants, the incapacitated, other animals, or even other aspects of the environment, beyond even anything that would be required by demands or claims of individual persons.

authority of some kind. Resentment doesn't represent its object as simply contravening one's will, but as contravening some justified demand. Moreover, if she feels impersonal reactive attitudes like indignation or blame, these will come as from a point of view she shares with them as members of the moral community. In feeling that they are to blame, she must think that they would rightly blame themselves and hold themselves responsible from the same point of view from which she blames them.

Of course, it is possible to think there are justified relations of authority that are not derivable from the mutual accountability of free and rational persons. For most of human history, in fact, it has seemed to most people that any justified order is quite incompatible with the kind of moral equality that many readers of this book, at least, might be willing to take for granted. Pufendorf himself probably thought this. I argue, however, that the address of second-personal reasons of any kind carries presuppositions that, when fully worked clear, commit addresser and addressee alike to their second personal competence and to an equal second-personal authority rooted in that, hence to the equal dignity of persons and to morality as a form of mutual accountability. Here, however, I simply wish to point out that any addressing of demands carries presuppositions of second-personality, just as it does in the moral case.

Consider the demands that a king or emperor makes of his subjects, for example, the Edict of Milan, which the Roman emperors Constantine and Licinius promulgated to stop Christian persecution in the Roman Empire. If Constantine and Licinius resented violations of this demand and blamed violators when they lacked adequate excuse, then in interpreting them as addressing (and so guiding) their subjects by second-personal reasons and not goading them, even by rational coercion, we must see them as having been committed thereby to regarding their subjects as capable of recognizing the edict's *(de jure)* authoritative backing and of guiding themselves by it. The normative felicity conditions of a command that can generate genuine second-personal reasons include the addressees' capacity for such a practically effective recognition. *Qua* second-personal address, the edict presupposed subjects' aptitude for this second-personal relation, specifically, their capacity for a reciprocal recognition and acceptance of their responsibilities to the emperor and, as well, their capacity to discharge their responsibility through this recognition.

I believe that the situation is the same with any reactive attitude, like

blame, resentment, or indignation, that addresses a second-personal reason. In every such case, the addresser is committed to presuppositions that parallel what Watson calls the "constraints of moral address," namely, that the addressee is capable of the requisite second-personal reciprocal recognition, mediated through his own reactive attitudes and practical reasoning.

### **Respect, Dignity, and Reactive Sanctions**

I have been stressing reactive attitudes' tie to presuppositions of freedom and equality. But aren't reactive attitudes, well, reactionary? Retribution can be difficult to separate from revenge and retaliation. Like Nietzsche, we may feel that attitudes like indignation and resentment are really a cover for cruelty or sado-masochism, a desire to see others or ourselves suffer, to extract a pound of flesh, or worse.36 Even Mill, who maintains that the idea of moral wrong is essentially related to reactive attitudes, nonetheless claims that these are not intrinsically moral responses. They only become moral when they are appropriately regulated by sympathy and directed toward the public good.37 Granted, Mill says, we wouldn't have the idea of justice or moral wrong if we didn't have emotions like resentment and the "natural feeling of retaliation or vengeance," but such a "sentiment, in itself, has nothing moral in it"; "what is moral is, the exclusive subordination of it to the social sympathies" (1998: ch. 5).

So why don't reactive attitudes involve the desire to retaliate? Don't "retributive" sentiments invariably bring in hostility and animosity, or at least some desire to balance a harming evil with some proportionate harm? Two ideas seem to be utterly essential to reactive attitudes. The first is that of a claim or demand, and the second is that of the corresponding statuses of addresser and addressee: the authority to address the

<sup>36</sup> Think of Abu Ghraib and also the Zimbardo prison experiments, in which ordinary undergraduates pretending to be prison guards sadistically abused the "prisoners" (Zimbardo, Ebbeson, and Maslach: 1977). See also Nietzsche 1994, especially the second essay (" 'Guilt,' 'Bad Conscience,' and the Like"). For a recent critique along somewhat similar lines, see Baier 1993. For a good contrast, however, see an interview of Nigerian human rights activist, Ayesha Imam, by Terry Gross, which discusses the phenomenon of Muslim men attacking Muslim women on the street as "punishment" for gender or sexual assertiveness, but within the context of a strong defense of accountability and rights: http:// freshair.npr.org/day_fa.jhtml?displayday&todayDate-12/05/2002.

<sup>37</sup> In this, I believe, he fails to appreciate Strawson's Point.

demand and the standing to be thus addressed and, consequently, to have to answer to the addresser, to be accountable or responsible to her for acknowledging and discharging the demand. Beyond these two essential elements, however, everything else seems, in principle, up for normative discussion and debate.38

It is a familiar idea that a theory of punishment can be retributive in spirit but still reject any thesis of strict proportionality—an eye for an eye, or whatever. Moreover, as Lawrence Stern (1974) has pointed out, examples like Gandhi and King show that it is possible to distinguish between accountability and reactive attitudes, on the one hand, and retaliation and revenge, on the other (see also Watson 1987: 286). Gandhi, King, and, we could add, Mandela certainly addressed demands, expressed attitudes that addressed demands, and explicitly and implicitly held others accountable for respecting them. But they did these in ways that enhanced (or made more visible) their own dignity and that respected that of their addressees precisely because they rejected retaliation.

Moral accountability does not have to be tied to any specific reactive attitude or even, in principle, to specifically human reactive attitudes at all.39 And even reactive attitudes like resentment and indignation can be distinguished from the desire to retaliate or gain vengeance, as we shall see presently.40 What is central is simply reciprocal recognition of the

<sup>38</sup> It follows from Strawson's Point, however, that this discussion must take place within the second-person standpoint. I argue in Chapter 12 that we should think of the contractualist framework in precisely this way. In that same spirit we might here say that the question of precisely what form practices of mutual accountability should take is itself appropriately addressed as a substantive problem of normative theory within contractualism.

<sup>39</sup> For example, if one thinks of blame as necessarily involving the expression of anger or some form of hostility, it need not involve blame in this sense. It must however involve blame in the formal sense of holding culpable.

<sup>40</sup> It is interesting in this connection to compare ancient Greek forms of responsibility. Drakon's homicide code mandated exile for someone who killed a fellow Athenian unless the killer was pardoned by all of the males of the victim's immediate family. However, if anyone retaliated against the killer in exile, so long as the killer stayed clear of public spaces on the frontier, such as markets and sacrificial meeting places, then that person was subject to a like sentence as well. Here we see a beginning of a distinction between justified and unjustified retaliation that moves in the direction of moral responsibility as we understand it. The desire to retaliate is here disciplined externally and procedurally, rather than by an internal distinction from resentment whose object is injustice. See Stroud 1979. I am indebted to Randall Curren for this reference and for very helpful discussion.

standing to make certain demands of one another, that is, in the moral case, mutual respect of the equal dignity of free and rational persons. Persons are accountable to each other for respecting their equal dignity, and reactive attitudes demand, and mediate accountability for, this form of respect. Exactly what can be required of individuals who violate these demands is a normative issue that should presumably turn on what sanctions would best realize the ideal of equal respect.41

When someone uses your foot as his footrest, this is an injury not just to your foot, but also to your person. It is a failure to respect your standing or dignity as someone who may not be so treated and who has the standing as one among others to hold others to this.42 Adam Smith observes that we are apt to resent disrespect for our person as much or more than any physical or psychic injury. What most "enrages us against the man who injures or insults us," Smith writes, "is the little account which he seems to make of *us* . . . that absurd self-love, by which he seems to imagine, that other people *may* be sacrificed at any time, to his conveniency" (1982a: 96).43

It is consistent with the object of reactive attitudes' invariably being disrespect, of course, that what they seek is still retaliation of some form, to hurt back, to give as good as we have gotten. On reflection, however, that cannot be right, as Smith himself saw. If reactive attitudes were retaliatory, then they would seek to return disrespect for disrespect. But as Strawson pointed out, moral reactive attitudes are themselves a form of respect. They view their targets as, like those who feel them, "member[s] of the moral community," and thus address them on terms of mutual respect (1968: 93). They seek reciprocal recognition of the (equal) dignity that they both claim (of the addresser) and presuppose (of the addressee). Smith writes insightfully that when we resent injuries, what our resentment is "chiefly intent upon, is not so much to make our enemy feel pain in his turn, as . . . to make him sensible, that the person whom he injured did not deserve to be treated in that manner" (1982: 95–96).44

<sup>41</sup> For example, within a contractualist framework.
<sup>42</sup> Again, I defend this conception of dignity in Chapter 10.

<sup>43</sup> Cf. Strawson's remark that in "much of our behaviour the benefit or injury resides mainly or entirely in the manifestation of the attitude itself" (1968: 76).

<sup>44</sup> In their introduction, Raphael and Macfie point out that Smith wrote, in his "Letter to the Editors of the *Edinburgh Review*" of July 1775, that he could "describe, from his own reading... Rousseau's *Discourse on Inequality*" (Smith 1982a: 10).

The implicit aim of reactive attitudes is to make others feel our dignity (and, less obviously, their own).

If this is right, reactive attitudes, and the practices of moral accountability they mediate, actually seek the reverse of what retaliation is after. Whereas to retaliate is to return disrespect for disrespect, holding someone accountable respectfully demands respect for disrespect. Reactive attitudes "continue to view [their object] as a member of the moral community" (Strawson 1968: 93).

Laura Blumenfeld (2002) provides a vivid illustration of this phenomenon in a fascinating description of her attempts to find the man, Omar Khatib, who had shot her father, David Blumenfeld, in order to hold Khatib responsible in some appropriate way.45 David had visited Jerusalem in 1986 during a period in which Omar and other members of a rebel faction of the PLO made several attacks on tourists in the Old City. David was such a tourist, and he narrowly escaped death when Omar's bullet only grazed his scalp. In her journey, Laura spends several years in Israel trying to get close to Omar, who is still in jail. Presenting herself to Omar's family as a journalist, she gets to know them and begins to correspond with Omar in letters the family smuggles to him in jail. Through these letters, Laura and Omar strike up a relationship without Omar or his family knowing Laura's true identity. Omar remains unrepentant throughout, seeing what he has done not as an attack against another person, but as an impersonal political action. Likewise, Omar's family sees the shooting as "nothing personal," a form of "public relations, a way to get people to look at us."

Blumenfeld finally hits upon a strategy for accountability and the circumstances to pursue it. A psychologist at Hebrew University, Hanoch Yerushalmi, convinces her that "the only substitute for revenge is acknowledgment." "Acknowledgment," he says, "is... accepting responsibility. It's when you 'own your own guilt' " (Blumenfeld 2002: 292).

Laura sees her chance the first time she and Omar lay eyes on each other at a legal proceeding to hear Omar's request to be released from prison because of deteriorating health. At a crucial point in the proceedings, Laura stands up and demands to speak. When the perplexed Israeli

<sup>45</sup> Blumenfeld's book is titled *Revenge: A Storyof Hope.* Like some reviewers of the book, I think Blumenfeld's term "constructive revenge" is actually a misnomer for the mutually respecting, or reciprocally recognizing, accountability that Blumenfeld actually describes (and achieves).

judges ask why, she begins by saying she has gotten to know the Khatib family and that she believes that Omar is sorry for what he has done. She says also that she has spoken to David Blumenfeld and that he agrees that Omar's request should be granted. When the justices challenge her right to speak, she replies to the hushed courtroom that she indeed has a right because she is David Blumenfeld's daughter. Shocked by this development, Omar and his family begin to weep. Blumenfeld writes: "Omar's mother, who did not understand my Hebrew, looked around the room, bewildered and said, 'Why are my children in tears?' " Asked by a judge why she has made this intervention, Laura says that she wanted Omar to know that "we're people. Not 'targets.' We're people with families. And you can't just kill us." Afterward, Omar writes to Laura, apologizing for being "the cause of your and your kind mother's pain." (Laura's mother had also been at the proceeding.) For the first time, he acknowledges the personality of his victim, calling him "David." He also writes to David, expressing his "deep pain and sorrow for what I caused you" (Blumenfeld 2002: 265–267).

Blumenfeld's story confirms Smith's diagnosis. Reactive attitudes seek respect. They seek to engage the other second-personally, and they succeed when the other takes up the address, acknowledges its terms, and thereby respects the dignity of the addresser, both the demand she addresses and her standing to address it.46 Respect thus enters into reactive attitudes in three distinct places: (1) their *object,* more precisely described, is always some form of apparent disrespect; (2) their *aim* is to demand respect; and (3) their *mode* involves respect for the person to whom they are held—they respectfully demand respect.

### **Accountability, Freedom, and Noncentral Cases**

But this may raise another worry. If reactive attitudes necessarily presuppose that those we seek to hold accountable have the ability to recognize

<sup>46</sup> Another poignant example can be found in the Very Reverend James Whyte's remarks at the memorial service for the victims of Pan Am 103 in Lockerbie, Scotland, in December, 1988: "We may be tempted, indeed urged by some, to flex our muscles in response, to show that we are men. To show that we are what?" Quoting now from Whyte's obituary in *The Scotsman* of June 27, 2005 (p. 39): "His calm and balanced reasoning seemed to strike a chord with all in the church and those watching on television. To see more young die, more rescue workers labour in more wreckage, he argued, was a sign, not of virility, but of inhumanity. 'That is what retaliation means,' Whyte concluded. 'I, for one, will have none of it, and I hope you will not either. Justice yes, retaliation no."

the validity of the second-personal reasons we address and to act on that recognition, might this not raise the bar too high? What gives us confidence that others actually have this ability, or that we do ourselves?47

It is unnecessary to establish independently that we do have moral freedom (second-personal competence) in order to hold one another accountable justifiably. As Kant's "fact of reason" shows, it can be enough that we have no particular reason to think we do not have moral freedom that would defeat the inescapable assumption that we do to which second-personal address commits us. But that doesn't mean that this hypothesis cannot be defeated. After all, the whole point of Strawson's distinction between objective and reactive attitudes is that there are beings we appropriately do view "objectively" precisely because they lack the requisite freedom to intelligibly be held accountable. And there are also cases, as Strawson points out, when people whom we generally are prepared to hold accountable fall into conditions, severe mental illness, for example, during which we appropriately withhold reactive attitudes. There is no reason, indeed, why this cannot also happen in one's own case. In an early stage of schizophrenia say, someone might make moral judgments of herself that have a presupposition of moral freedom that, regrettably, no longer holds.

So even if we are entitled to a defeasible presumption of moral freedom, this can be rebutted by the facts on the ground. And thus a version of the worry reemerges. Even if we exclude the uncontroversially "objective" cases Strawson mentions, including very young children and those suffering from delusional insanity, there seem to be many cases where we wish to hold others accountable though we seem to have very good evidence that they are not free to act on moral reasons in the way our practices of holding someone fully responsible seem to presuppose.

We can hardly deal with this worry with any thoroughness here. In general, I believe that to do so systematically, we would have to think of what I have said so far as applying to a central ideal case (what we might call the case of "full responsibility") and see other cases as departures that must be understood in one way or another by reference to the central second-personal case. In some instances, for example with children, we

<sup>47</sup> Of course, the normative presuppositions of any specific form of second-personal address can be defeated also. In Chapters 10 and 11, I argue that morality's authority can be vindicated by an appreciation of their role in second-personal address in general and of the distinctive form of practical freedom we have by virtue of our capacity for second-personal relations.

seem simultaneously to move on two tracks in the process of inducting them into full second-personal responsibility, sometimes treating them proleptically as though they were apt for second-personal address as a way of developing moral competence while nonetheless realizing ("objectively") that this is an illusion that must also be recognized.48

Something similar may be true where there are deficits that rule out full responsibility, such as people with Alzheimer's disease or Down's syndrome, but where there is no such forward-looking process. Here we may work along two tracks as well, perhaps a fully, at least putatively, second-personal track in relatively limited areas along with continuous negotiation about the limits.49 And there may be cases, which we will consider further presently, where we seem to hold someone fully responsible even in the face of the conviction that he really couldn't have been expected to determine himself by the demands we make in holding him responsible. Such cases must always create some discomfort, I think, since we treat them as though they were a central second-personal case, perhaps to affirm to ourselves and to one another the demands we make on the person we hold accountable, in the belief that the necessary presuppositions of doing so may very likely not be satisfied.50

That all said, I would like to say something briefly about two quite different kinds of cases. One is that of people we attempt to hold accountable for forms of abuse and violence that they attempt to excuse as due to uncontrollable emotion. In these cases, as I see it, we are generally right to suppose that the assumption of freedom is not defeated. The second, which really may pose a challenge to the presupposition is that of an extreme psychopath, perhaps someone like Robert Alton Harris, who was convicted in 1978 of the horrific killing of two teenage boys, whom Gary Watson discusses in just these terms.51

Cases of the first kind are well exemplified by varieties of domestic

<sup>48</sup> I am indebted here to Schapiro 1999 and 2003a. Also see Dewey 1998a: 343, which reference I owe to Elizabeth Anderson.

<sup>49</sup> I have been helped here by discussion with Christie Hartley and by her work on how the disabled should be represented within contractualism (2005).

<sup>50</sup> I am indebted to Charles Griswold and Richard Kraut for discussion here.

<sup>51</sup> Harris was executed in 1992, the first California execution in twenty-five years. Watson gives many of the details of Harris's life (Watson 1987: 268–271), quoting from Corwin 1982. See also an article by Harris's lawyer in his appeals of the death sentence (Laurence 1997).

violence, road rage, and the like. On analysis, it is often clear enough that the acts of abuse or violence were freely chosen, that the principals could have done otherwise but indulged themselves in thoughts and feelings that rationalized their actions in one way or another. One sign that this is so is when victimizers do not consistently stick to the claim that what they did was an excusable wrong, but lapse also into purported justifications of their actions as deserved or as a kind of "correction" that really was for the good for the victim. In unguarded moments, the emotions and attitudes they express are not grief and regret for what they have done along with disquieting confusion about how they could have acted in this way, but instead project some sense of justification. What seems to be going on here is something like what Kant called "self-conceit," frequently tied to some legitimating ideology, like male sovereignty.52 It is not that the person is dead to moral categories; rather he distorts them for his own purposes.

The case of psychopaths, however, seems very different. Although at points in his life Robert Harris may have been more like the kind of person just discussed, by the time of his most grisly murders he manifested a coldness and utter imperviousness to moral demands, even in the corrupted form of self-conceit, suggesting that he was inapt for moral address, a moral outlaw who was outside the moral community. Despite this, there may be reasons for holding people like Harris accountable.

As Watson describes it, Harris's coldness resulted from prior willful choices to repudiate the moral community, born partly of a history of being a victim of terrible abuse himself—not exactly a Kantian timeless choice of evil, but more like a series of repudiating choices.53 It may be that at later points Harris was unable to do other than continue on the "road to hell" he had chosen before.54 Treating him as accountable now,

<sup>52</sup> I discuss Kant on self-conceit in Chapter 6.

<sup>53</sup> Watson suggests this at Watson 1987: 271. Meno Myejes's screenplay, *Max* (2002), implies something similar about Hitler. Discussing it, Myejes says, "Hitler, like Osama and Saddam and Milosevic, obliges us by representing an uncomplicated picture of evil. But nobody wakes up one day and slaughters thousands. They make choices, one at a time." He also remarks that his movie "isn't about Hitler's great crimes. The audience knows all about them already. This is about his small sins—his emotional cowardice, his relentless self-pity, his envy, his frustration, the way he collects and nurtures offenses" (Malanowski 2002: 1, 36).

<sup>54</sup> Harris's sister was quoted as saying, "He told me he had his chance, he took the road to hell and there's nothing more to say" (Watson: 1987: 270). Even at this point, however, if Harris was still capable of resenting injuries done to him, he was still a participant in the second-person standpoint, only highly selectively. I am grateful to Arthur Ripstein here.

however, respectfully repudiates the repudiation. Even if it carries a presupposition that is now literally false, it can have an important expressive function for the community nonetheless: upholding the dignity of the person. Moreover, there may simply be no publicly reliable way of distinguishing cases where there is literal incapacity from those where people are still capable of moral redemption, but freely choose not to redeem themselves (perhaps Harris at some earlier point, or even later—who knows?). So even when we are confronted with cases like that of Robert Harris, a presupposition of moral freedom may be a justified form of "practical faith," which we may lack sufficient evidence to defeat.55

However, if we come to the view that this presupposition is in fact defeated in particular cases, this need put no significant pressure on the presupposition as it operates in our ordinary practices of accountability.56 We can still find an appropriate justification for limiting a genuinely nonsecond-personally-competent psychopath's liberty in self-protection. And the very fact that we will have to think of our justification in other terms, that is, as not genuinely holding the psychopath responsible, will be evidence for the second-personal character of our practices of moral responsibility as they normally function.57

<sup>55</sup> The allusion, of course, is to Kant's postulates of the existence of God and immortality of the soul in *The Critique of Practical Reason.*

<sup>56</sup> See Robert D. Hare (1993) for a pessimistic view of the possibilities of overlap between psychopathology and emotional mechanisms, like empathy, that are necessary for second-personal competence.

## 5. Moral Obligation and Accountability

It is a curious feature of the contemporary philosophical scene that, although Strawson's critique has been very influential in debates about responsibility and free will within moral psychology and the philosophy of action, its implications for the metaethics of moral obligation as well as for normative moral theory have been largely ignored. In this chapter, I argue that there is an intrinsic conceptual connection between moral obligation and moral responsibility, one Strawson himself implicitly relies upon. It follows, I argue, that Strawson's influential critique of consequentialist accounts of moral responsibility can be turned into a powerful criticism of consequentialist theories of moral obligation, most obviously, of act-consequentialism, but arguably also of indirect consequentialist approaches such as rule-consequentialism.1 When we reflect on obligation's intrinsic connection to (second-personal) accountability, we see that subserving an external goal is a reason of the wrong kind to justify moral obligation no less than it is to warrant claims of moral responsibility. Like moral responsibility, moral obligation is an irreducibly second-personal concept. That an action would violate a moral obligation is, I here argue, a second-personal reason not to do it.

### **Accountability and the Metaethics of Moral Obligation**

One way to see this is to note that Strawson includes a "sense of obligation" as a (reflexive) reactive attitude and that he characterizes the

<sup>1</sup> Except, again, when these are themselves grounded in the second-personal idea that all persons have an equal claim. On this point, see note 32 of Chapter 4 and "Contractualism and Rule-Consequentialism" in Chapter 12. I am indebted here, again, to Allan Gibbard and Jim Staihar.

skepticism he takes pragmatic approaches to responsibility to be responding to as holding that if determinism is true, "then the concepts of moral obligation and responsibility really have no application" (1968: 86, 71). As Strawson sees it, skepticism about free agency puts pressure on both moral responsibility and moral obligation. Strawson doesn't say directly why this should be so, but it is clear enough that he takes moral obligation and responsibility to be intrinsically related conceptually, and not just as a matter of substantive normative judgment. What we are morally obligated to do, he seems to be thinking, is what members of the moral community can appropriately demand that we do, including by responding with blame or other reactive attitudes if we fail to comply without adequate excuse.

Perhaps the best-known invocation of this idea is, ironically enough, by a consequentialist thinker, namely, John Stuart Mill.2 In the course of considering in chapter 5 of *Utilitarianism* (1998) how a utilitarian might account for rights and justice, Mill provides a genealogy of conceptions of justice and concludes that "the primitive element, in the formation of the notion of justice, was conformity to law" and that this involves the idea of warranted sanctions. Mill evidently means this as a conceptual point. More importantly for our purposes, Mill goes on to apply this conceptual analysis to "moral obligation in general." And then he famously adds:

We do not call anything wrong, unless we mean to imply that a person ought to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow-creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience. This seems the real turning point of the distinction between morality and simple expediency. It is a part of the notion of Duty in every one of its forms, that a person may rightfully be compelled to fulfill it. Duty is a thing which may be exacted from a person, as one exacts a debt. (1998: ch. 5, para. 14)

Mill seems to be on safe ground in saying that our concept of wrongdoing is essentially related to accountability. Even if it is natural to think

<sup>2</sup> In Mill 1998: ch. 5. Another landmark is Rawls's argument in "Two Concepts of Rules" (1955) that practices are frequently constituted by rules that forbid participants to appeal to any external goals the practice might be thought to achieve. For an excellent discussion of this point, see Johnson 1985. Also relevant is Hart's famous distinction between the "internal" and "external" perspective within a regime of law or other set of norms (1961: 55–57).

that a person falls short of full virtue if she does only what can be required of her—is a "minimally decent," rather than a good, Samaritan, in Judith Thomson's (1971) terms—it seems unnatural to suppose that she thereby does wrong. What is wrong is what we can be morally expected not to do, what the moral community assumes the authority to hold us to. We hesitate to impute wrongdoing unless we take ourselves to be in the range of the culpable, that is, unless the action is such that the agent is aptly blamed or the object of some other form of accountability-seeking reactive attitude if she lacks an adequate excuse.3

This aspect of the concept of moral wrong has been stressed also by a number of contemporary writers. John Skorupski says that calling an act "morally wrong... amounts to blaming the agent" and that the idea of moral wrong can't be understood independently of that of blameworthiness (1999: 29, 142). Allan Gibbard quite explicitly follows Mill's lead in proposing that "what a person does is *morallywrong* if and only if it is rational for him to feel guilty for having done it, and for others to be angry at him for having done it" (1990: 42). And we can find versions of this Millian idea in other writers also (Baier 1966; Brandt 1979; Shafer-Landau 2003). (It is consistent with these views that there remains a distinction between the wrongness of acts and the blameworthiness of agents. Someone may not be to blame for wrongdoing if he has an excuse.)

Perhaps most striking is the role the connection plays in neo-Nietzschean critiques of morality and moral obligation, most prominently by Bernard Williams.4 Williams's version of the Nietzschean critique that morality is an enslaving ideology, a form of false consciousness that shackles and sickens, runs through conceptual relations he sees between

<sup>3</sup> The original meaning of 'impute' is relevant here: "To bring (a fault or the like) into the reckoning against; to lay to the charge of; to attribute or assign as due or owing to" (*Oxford English Dictionary,* online edition). See also Pufendorf on "imputativity" below. As T. M. Scanlon has pointed out to me, however, there may be cases where we take ourselves to have the authority to blame someone and make demands of them even when we don't think they act wrongly, as, for example, when someone does the right thing, but for utterly unconscionable reasons, say, out of a virulent racism.

<sup>4</sup> Especially in Williams 1985. For a discussion, see Darwall 1987. See also Williams 1995 and Baier 1993. Nietzsche's diagnosis of morality "in the pejorative sense" is primarily given in Nietzsche 1994. For useful discussion, see Leiter 1995 and 1997.

It is worth noting that, although Williams is a critic of what we might call the "internal" aspects of second-personal accountability of the "morality system," he does embrace the moral obligation, blame, and reasons for acting.5 Williams evidently assumes that it is a conceptual truth that violations of moral obligations are appropriately blamed and that blaming implies the existence of good and sufficient reasons to do what someone is blamed for not doing. The idea is not, of course, that normative reasons follow from the fact of someone's being blamed. Rather, in blaming one implies or presupposes that there are such reasons. According to Williams (1995), this presupposition is a bit of false consciousness. And what makes it so, according to him, are his famous *internal reasons thesis*, which asserts that all normative reasons for action must be anchored appropriately in the agent's own "motivational set" (be "internal reasons"), and his claim that nothing guarantees any connection between what we take to license blame when we attempt to hold agents accountable and their own motivations.6

It is important to the argument of this book that Williams is actually right about these conceptual connections between imputing wrong and blame and between blame and attributing authoritative reasons. Moral obligation really is conceptually related to standards of minimally decent conduct that moral agents are accountable for complying with. And the forms of moral accountability—blame, guilt, indignation, punishment, and so on—really do imply that agents have reasons (indeed, conclusive reasons) to do what they are morally obligated and accountable for doing.7 Moreover, depending on how we understand the idea of a "motivational set," it may also be possible, consistently with the substantive normative claims of this book (that equal second-personal authority

idea of human rights and the "external" forms necessary to enforce them. But this means, I believe, that participants in moral practices of enforcement, including all citizens when they participate in public discourse, are unable to accept reasons of the right kind for the second-personal demands through which they seek to enforce their rights. Their justification must consist in something like the desirability of using power, not any authority to use it. In my view, Hume's ideas about justice lead to the same result (see Chapter 8). Both run afoul of Strawson's Point. I am indebted here to discussion with Simon Blackburn.

<sup>5</sup> Williams encourages the association with slavery himself by referring to morality as the "peculiar institution" in the title of chapter 10 ("Morality, the Peculiar Institution") of Williams 1985.

<sup>6</sup> The former is a version of what I have called "existence internalism" (Darwall 1983: 54–55).

<sup>7</sup> Again, this is implied or presupposed in holding people accountable. It is not implied by the fact that we hold them accountable. We shall consider this point further presently.

grounds second-personal reasons), to hold a version of Williams's internal reasons thesis. However, I argue that reasons for acting are not constrained in any way by an agent's state-or outcome-regarding desires or even by his capacities to form such desires.8 Any desires that are implicated in action on second-personal reasons, including action on the reasons we imply when we hold persons accountable for compliance with moral obligations, are "principle-dependent" rather than "objectdependent," in Rawls's terms (2000). And my claim is that second-personal relations and reactive attitudes quite generally address second-personal reasons in a way that presupposes that addressees have the capacity to be moved by these reasons through accepting principles to which their reciprocally recognizing participation in second-personal relations commits them.

Nothing depends, of course, on whether we use the words 'wrong' and 'moral obligation' in the way Mill and these contemporary thinkers say we do. We could use these words more broadly to include moral ideals or goals. However, if we did, we would still need terms to refer to the idea to which these thinkers point, namely, the part of morality that concerns that for which we appropriately hold one another responsible. And it seems clear enough that, as all these writers agree, this involves a notion of moral demands, that is, of standards of conduct that the moral community has the authority to demand compliance with, including through second-personal forms of accountability of the sort we canvassed in the last chapter. With this understanding, therefore, I henceforth use 'wrong' and 'moral obligation' in a Millian way as implying accountability-seeking demands.

Using 'wrong' in this way does not, we should note, require that there be an assignable victim who is wronged (hence, that what Mill regards as a right be in play), or even that that violations of norms of a community of mutually accountable persons directly threaten the interests of such persons. It is consistent with the idea that wrongdoing is essentially tied to accountability, even accountability to other moral persons, that what we are accountable for can extend, for example, to the treatment of nonrational animals, aspects of the environment, and nonrational human beings.9

<sup>8</sup> Rawls calls these "object-dependent" desires in Rawls 2000: 45–48, 148–152.

<sup>9</sup> See the discussion of this point in Chapter 2.

### **Making Moral Obligation's Second-Personality Explicit**

Debates in moral theory rarely tie moral obligation to second-personal accountability explicitly, but they often implicitly assume such a connection nonetheless. In this section, we note this phenomenon in two familiar debates. One takes place within normative ethical theory between consequentialists and their critics over whether act-consequentialism is "too demanding." The other concerns morality's authority or, as it is sometimes put, "Why be moral?" In both cases, analysis of what most deeply underlies the debate reveals an assumption that moral obligation and standards of right and wrong are conceptually related to what the moral community, and we as members, can demand (second-personally).

Take the "too demanding" criticism first. Act-consequentialism's critics sometimes concede, *arguendo,* that an agent may always do best from the moral point of view by maximizing overall net good, for example, by always investing energy and resources at the margin to combat hunger, disease, and oppression worldwide. But they argue that even if this were so, it wouldn't follow that failing, say, to produce small marginal increases in overall value at very large personal cost is wrong. And they argue, furthermore, that a theory that requires that we do so is unreasonably demanding.10 What underlies this objection?

The following formulation puts the criticism in a way that helps one to see what is going on:

Perhaps we would admire someone who behaved in this way. But is it plausible to claim that those of us who do not are guilty of wrongdoing; or that we have a moral obligation to devote all our resources to charity?11

"Guilty of wrongdoing" is the revealing phrase. Wrongdoing is something one can be charged with and, lacking adequate account or excuse, be guilty of, where guilt is a verdict (an Austinian "verdictive") in some quasi-legal, second-personal form of accountability.12

<sup>10</sup> A particularly good example is Scheffler 1982.

<sup>11</sup> This formulation actually comes from someone who tries to defend consequentialism in the face of the "demandingness" objection (Mulgan 2001).

<sup>12</sup> Compare Nietzsche's claim that, whereas in the aristocratic ethos, 'good' is the primary notion and 'bad' is defined as not 'good', in morality (in the pejorative sense), 'evil' is the primary notion and 'good' is its contradictory (in our terms: 'wrong' and 'right' [not wrong]) (Nietzsche 1994).

That one is guilty of wrongdoing is not simply a finding that what one did was less than the best one could have done (even when this is the normative standard of wrongdoing); it is the judgment that one did less than can be expected or demanded and that one can implicitly demand of oneself in a second-personal feeling that acknowledges guilt. What underlies the "demandingness" objection, therefore, is the worry that actconsequentialism's standard of right goes beyond what we can reasonably demand of one another (second-personally). A moral demand just is, *inter alia,* there being warrant to address a demand (second-personally) to someone as one person among others, "if not by law, by the opinion of his fellow-creatures; if not by opinion, by the reproaches of his own conscience" (Mill 1998: ch. 5). To make sense of the "demandingness" objection, therefore, we must see it as resting on the assumption that wrong and moral obligation are conceptually related to holding morally responsible, hence to second-personal demanding as it functions, for example, in the reactive attitude of guilt.

The other debate in which such a conceptual connection is implicitly assumed concerns morality's purported authority, that is, whether moral obligations are categorical imperatives in Foot's (amplified by Scheffler's) sense of always necessarily giving or entailing (conclusive) reasons for acting. In Chapters 10 and 11, I take on this question directly and argue that a conception of morality as equal accountability can be grounded in a theory of practical reason in a way that vindicates the claim that moral agents always necessarily have conclusive reasons not to violate moral obligations. At this point, however, I am concerned with what underlies this authoritative purport. Why does the statement "But it would be wrong" always purport to provide a conclusive reason?13

A number of writers, most prominently, again, Bernard Williams, have argued that holding someone accountable for wrongdoing through blame unavoidably carries the implication that she had conclusive reason not to

<sup>13</sup> Note that I say purport to provide conclusive reason. Richard Nixon evidently relied on this implication, according to H. R. Haldeman's testimony, when he said in response to the question of whether hush money could be raised to pay off the Watergate burglars: "There is no problem in raising a million dollars, we can do that. But it would be wrong." (The last "five crucial words" were not confirmed by John Dean's testimony.) ("Seven Charged, a Report and a Briefcase," *Time* 103 (March 11, 1974): 10–14.)

do what she is blamed for doing (Williams 1995: 40–44; see also Gibbard 1990: 299–300; Shafer-Landau 2003: 181–183; Skorupski 1999: 42–43; Wallace 1994).14 Williams believes that this implication is "bluff," a bit of ideology that it is hopeless to try to vindicate or validate, since the only reasons for acting the person we blame can possibly have are internal reasons that are suitably anchored in her desires or other motivational susceptibilities, and, he thinks, nothing we could say on behalf of moral demands could possibly guarantee that. At this point, we need not concern ourselves with this latter claim. We will have occasion to return to the issue of what moral psychology we presuppose when we make demands and what its relation is to the validity of second-personal reasons at various points later.15 At this juncture we need focus only on Williams's claim that blaming carries this implication, that is, that we cannot intelligibly demand that someone act in some way without implying that she has good and sufficient reason to do so.

Again, this just seems straightforwardly true. Try formulating an expression with which you might address a moral demand to someone. I doubt that you can find one that does not carry the implication that she has conclusive reason to do what you are demanding or reason not to have done what you are blaming her for. Certainly none of the obvious formulations will work. For example, you can hardly sensibly say, "You really shouldn't have done that," and then add "but you did have, nonetheless, conclusive reasons for doing it." And if you try to pull your punches, by saying "You shouldn't have done that, I mean, you know, morally speaking," although you may end up canceling the implication of conclusive reasons, it's hard to see how you can do that without also canceling an implication of blame or demand. Or to turn the point around, if someone were able to establish that she did in fact have good and sufficient reason for a putative violation of a moral obligation, then it seems she has accounted or answered for herself and shown she did no wrong.16 When we charge her with wrongdoing, therefore, we must be implying that she can not provide such an account.

Or recall Philippa Foot's comparison between morality and etiquette

<sup>14</sup> It is no coincidence that Williams is an original source of the "too demandingness" objection to consequentialism (Smart and Williams 1973).

<sup>15</sup> The issue is addressed mainly in Chapter 7.

<sup>16</sup> I am indebted to Christine Korsgaard for this way of putting it.

(1972). Norms of etiquette and morality are both categorical in form, and some norms of etiquette can be expressed in no less mandatory terms than can those of morality. One simply must not eat peas with a knife. But even so, we can cancel any implication that a 'must' of manners carries conclusive normative authority without thereby calling into question etiquette's customary normative purport. We can sensibly say that sometimes there is good reason not to do what etiquette requires without any suggestion that we are thereby somehow debunking manners. What explains this difference?

I believe that it is, again, moral obligation's essential tie to second-personal accountability. It is part of the very idea of a moral demand that we are accountable for complying. But such accountability seems no part whatsoever of the idea that etiquette requires something. That doesn't mean that manners are not, to some extent, "morals writ small," or that etiquette cannot be an important part of or supplement to equal respect.17 And it is also obviously true that some people treat etiquette, or parts of it, as having an importance that is tantamount to morality's. The point is that accountability is no part of the concept of etiquette in the way it is of moral obligation. To the contrary, what etiquette usually calls for when its norms are violated is not accountability but something more like distracting attention from an otherwise embarrassing reciprocal recognition of a gaffe or, perhaps, third-personal disdain. Calling someone to account for bad manners is often bad manners itself.

### **Morality's Normativity and Second-Personal Reasons**

The very ideas of wrong and moral obligation, therefore, are intrinsically related to the forms of second-personal address that, as we saw in Chapter 4, help constitute moral accountability. It follows that the fact that an action is wrong, or that it violates a moral obligation, must itself purport to be or entail a second-personal reason (or reasons). There can be no such thing as moral obligation and wrongdoing without the normative standing to demand and hold agents accountable for compliance. Of course, many of the reasons that ground claims of wrong and obligation are not themselves second-personal. That an action would cause severe harm, or even pain to your bunions, is a reason for someone not to do

<sup>17</sup> On the latter, see Buss 1996a and Sherman unpublished.

it, whether or not anyone has any standing to demand that he not, and it supports, moreover, a relevant demand. But the action cannot violate a moral obligation unless such a standing exists, so any reason that is entailed by the moral obligation must be second-personal. Consequently, if moral obligations purport to provide conclusive normative reasons, other reasons to the contrary notwithstanding, then this must derive somehow from their second-personal character.

As I mentioned in Chapter 2, the projects of analyzing and vindicating morality's distinctive purported authority are generally framed in terms of "categoricality" and the normative weight of reasons to be moral. We are now in a position to appreciate why I there added that any attempt to account for moral obligation's distinctive bindingness must also explicate its distinctive tie to accountability. An adequate analysis of the concept of moral obligation must account for its conceptual connection to warranted demands. Even if it were possible, consequently, to account otherwise either for moral obligations' invariably purporting to provide superior normative reasons or their actually doing so, it would still be impossible thereby to explicate the distinctive hold or bindingness that moral obligations purport to have. This can only be done in second-personal terms.

This means that the project of analyzing morality's normativity is seriously incomplete as it has traditionally been conceived. I believe, moreover, that the significance of the fact that moral obligation's distinctive reasons are second-personal goes beyond even this. I have argued also in this chapter that appreciating moral obligation's tie to accountability provides the best explanation of morality's purported normativity as traditionally conceived. And I argue further in Chapters 10 and 11 that this normative purport can be vindicated as well when we see the place of second-personal reasons in an overall picture of practical reason. It follows that appreciating the second-personal character of moral obligation is necessary both to understanding its normative purport (both its putative normative weight and conceptual tie to moral responsibility) and to the most promising way of backing this hefty promissory note.

### **Morality as Equal Accountability**

I have been arguing that being subject to moral obligations includes accountability to those with the normative standing to demand compliance. So far, this has been a conceptual thesis: *moral obligation as accountability.*

This abstract concept admits of different specifications or conceptions, however.18 For much of the rest of this chapter, I discuss the early modern voluntarist version of morality as accountability: *moralityas accountability to God.* According to the voluntarists' conception, only God has the ultimate authority to make moral demands. Even if human beings reciprocally benefit by complying with God's commands, we have no underived normative standing to expect compliance of one another or of ourselves. However, when voluntarists like Pufendorf thought through what is presupposed in addressing demands as genuinely second-personal reasons, they began to see that they were committed also to the idea that moral subjects must be assumed to be capable of imposing moral demands on themselves through recognizing that they validly apply to them as rational persons. And this put significant pressure on their thought in the direction of a different conception, one I call *moralityas equal accountability.*

We can see a similar movement of thought in other thinkers as well. Although it is rarely appreciated, Adam Smith also makes accountability central to his picture of morality.19 "A moral being," Smith says, "is an accountable being," who "must give an account of its actions to some other, and that consequently must regulate them according to the goodliking of this other" (1982a: 111). Although Smith says that man is "principally accountable to God," he quickly adds that each "must necessarily conceive himself as accountable to his fellow-creatures, before he can form any idea of the Deity" (1982a: 111n).20

*Moralityas equal accountability* is the conception I defend in this book. According to this conception, moral norms regulate a community of equal, mutually accountable, free and rational agents as such, and moral obligations are the demands such agents have standing to address to one another and with which they are mutually accountable for complying. In Kantian terms, norms of moral obligation are "laws" for a "kingdom of ends," which structure and define the equal dignity of persons as beings who may not be treated in some ways and must be in others and who have equal standing to demand this second-personally of one another.21

<sup>18</sup> For the general concept/conception framework, see Rawls 1971: 5.

<sup>19</sup> I discuss this aspect of Smith's views in Darwall 1999b.

<sup>20</sup> Note, however, that Smith does not retain this passage in the sixth edition. I am indebted to Vivienne Brown and Charles Griswold for reminding me of this.

<sup>21</sup> "By a *kingdom* [*of ends*] I understand a systematic union of various rational beings through common laws" (Kant 1996b: 433). Also: "In the kingdom of ends everything has So conceived, "morality is," as Kant puts it, "the condition under which alone a rational being can be an end in itself, since only through this is it possible to be a lawgiving member in the kingdom of ends" (1996b: 435).

Morality as equal accountability understands the moral point of view to be fundamentally *intersubjective.* It holds the moral perspective to be an impartially disciplined version of the second-person standpoint, in which, as anyone (or, as an equal participant in the first-person plural ["we"] of the moral community), one addresses someone (oneself or someone else) also as anyone (as another equal member).22 It is useful to contrast this understanding of the moral point of view with the impersonal standpoint that Nagel, in *The Possibilityof Altruism*, famously argued is the perspective from which one must be able to see others' interests, and ultimately one's own, as reason-giving (Nagel 1970). Such a point of view, Nagel maintained, is one from which one sees oneself simply as "one among others equally real."

However, an impersonal perspective *on* one among others is not necessarily the standpoint *of* one among others. It is not the intersubjective stance of someone relating to others as, and reciprocally recognizing his status as, one among others.23 According to morality as equal accountability, the moral point of view is intersubjective in precisely this sense. It is an impartially regulated second-personal stance rather than a third-personal perspective on individuals, oneself included, as simply one among others.24 In morality as equal accountability, agents relate to one

either a *price* or a *dignity*.... Morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, is that which alone has dignity" (434–435). As I stress in Chapters 6 and 10, Kant also says that the dignity of persons is that "by which [a person] exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world" (1996d: 435).

<sup>22</sup> For the claim that moral point of view is "first-person plural" see Postema 1995. It is also a theme of Korsgaard's writings.

<sup>23</sup> This is also a theme of Christine Korsgaard's, in Korsgaard 1996d: esp. 275–276, 301. However, Korsgaard there seems to think that all reasons involve the making of claims (whereas I restrict this to second-personal reasons): "To say that you have a reason is to say something *relational,* something which implies the existence of another, at least another self. It announces that you have a claim on that other, or acknowledges her claim on you" (Korsgaard 1996d: 301). In my view, this conflates the general category of normative reasons with the distinctively second-personal reasons that figure in justifying ourselves to one another.

<sup>24</sup> I believe this is also the right way of understanding Adam Smith's sentimentalist metaethics of moral judgment, especially of judgments of justice. On this point, see Darwall 1999b.

another as one among others second-personally; they don't simply view each other that way third-personally.25

We should now recall the thought with which we began this chapter, namely, that, owing to the connection between moral obligation and accountability, Strawson's criticisms of consequentialist accounts of responsibility can be turned into a critique of consequentialist accounts of obligation. The problem with pragmatic approaches to responsibility, recall, is that they point to reasons of the wrong kind, since reasons of desirability are in themselves irrelevant to any standards to which we are committed from within the (second-person) stance we unavoidably occupy when we hold one another responsible. Since responsibility and obligation are conceptually tied in the ways we have noted, if this is a problem with consequentialist approaches to responsibility, it must be a problem also with consequentialist theories of moral obligation and wrongdoing. However desirable it might be from some external perspective that someone do something, this is a reason of the wrong kind to support a demand that he do it, and hence to support the claim that he would do wrong if he didn't. Unlike considerations of desirability (even moral desirability), demands are second-personal reasons; their validity depends not on the value of any outcome or state, but on normative relations between persons, on one person's having the authority to address the demand to another. It follows that claims of moral obligation or wrongdoing must be supportable from within the second-person standpoint and grounded in presuppositions to which you and I are committed when we reciprocally recognize one another as free and equal persons.

This line of thought tells fairly directly against act-consequentialist theories of moral obligation.26 That explains why consequentialists who are influenced by Mill regarding obligation's tie to blameworthiness, like Brandt and arguably Mill himself, tend to hold some form of indirect consequentialism, such as rule-consequentialism (Brandt 1965, 1979; Hooker 2000; Johnson 1991). But indirect consequentialism just seems to postpone the difficulty, since even though it admits a distinction between the desirable and the obligatory, the only support it al-

<sup>25</sup> On this, see Christine Korsgaard's important work (1996a).

<sup>26</sup> For a related line of criticism, see Johnson 1985.

lows for claims of obligation are instrumental considerations regarding how a practice of obligation and accountability itself, structured by some candidate rule, serves to advance an external goal. And this still seems a reason of the wrong kind.27 By contrast, morality as equal accountability understands standards of moral obligation as requiring support entirely within the second-personal standpoint itself—all the way down. In Chapters 10 through 12, I sketch how this might be done within a contractualism that is grounded in a theory of second-personal reasons.

### **Accountability and Second-Personal Reasons in Early Modern Natural Law**

Morality as equal accountability is, again, only one interpretation (or conception) of the concept of morality as accountability. In the rest of this chapter, I discuss the early modern natural law conception of morality as accountability to God, as we find it in, for example, Suarez, Pufendorf, and Locke.28 My purpose is twofold. First, it is useful to grasp in a detailed way accountability's role in some of the earliest attempts to articulate a distinctively modern concept of morality.29 Second, I want to display tensions within early modern voluntarism that lead in the direction of morality as equal accountability. In these respects, it is helpful, I believe, to think of the conception of morality as accountability to God as an ancestor conception of morality as equal accountability. I present this discussion here, however, less for its historical interest and more

<sup>27</sup> Of course, as I have noted before, most recently in note 1 above, an act-or ruleconsequentialist theory of right might avoid this problem if it could be adequately grounded in an equal claim to happiness, welfare, or something similar.

<sup>28</sup> In what follows, I draw on Darwall 2003a.

<sup>29</sup> Here I follow Schneewind 1998 in thinking that the "Grotian problematic," that is, distinguishing between, and trying to appropriately relate, the idea of an individual's good and some other regulating idea (justice, right, or the morally obligatory) provides the distinctive backdrop for a "modern" concept of morality. I discuss this point in Darwall 1995a: ch. 1 and 1999a. Also relevant is Sidgwick's perceptive remark that "the most fundamental difference" between modern and ancient ethical thought is that, whereas the ancients believed that there is only one "regulative and governing faculty" to be "recognized under the name of Reason," "in the modern view, when it has worked itself clear, there are found to be two—Universal Reason and Egoistic Reason, or Conscience and Self-love" (Sidgwick 1964: 197–198). For a discussion of this claim, see Frankena 1992.

because it will enable me to provide some context for Pufendorf 's Point, which will play a significant role in the argument of Chapter 10.

What can the idea of mutual accountability between equals owe to the early modern idea of morality as subjection to the will of superior authority? From the outset, the voluntarist natural lawyers combined two ideas that have central importance for morality as equal accountability. First, and most obviously, they held that morality essentially involves accountability. Moral norms don't say just what we are required to do, but also what we are answerable for doing. Morality requires us to account for our conduct in light of its demands, and unexcused violations can be imputed to our account. Of course, Pufendorf believed that morality essentially involves accountability to a superior authority, namely God. But, he also believed that being thus accountable is only possible for free rational agents who are able to hold themselves responsible who can determine themselves by their acceptance of the validity of the demands, thereby imposing them on themselves.30 I argue that this idea exerted a pressure on his thought in the direction of morality as equal accountability, although the latter is not, of course, a conception he accepted or likely would have accepted on reflection.

The second idea is that moral norms derive from demands one will has the standing to address to or make on another (free and rational) will and that moral obligation would not exist but for the possibility of reasons that can arise through, and that are presupposed by, this second-personal relationship. Again, the modern natural lawyers believe that the requisite relationship is asymmetric: morality involves, in its nature, being subject to God's authoritative will. At the same time, however, their view is that the relevant relation is essentially between rational wills and that it differs from subjugation, intimidation, or any form of non-rational control, as well as from the kind of reason-giving involved in rational coercion. Pufendorf makes an explicit distinction between being moved by an acceptance of an obligation rooted in God's authority and merely submitting to God's greater power (Pufendorf 's Point).

<sup>30</sup> Like Pufendorf, Locke also thought that " 'Person' is a Forensick Term appropriating Actions and their Merit; and so belongs only to intelligent Agents capable of a Law" (Locke 1975: 346). However, his moral psychology differed from Pufendorf 's in important ways. For a discussion of relevant differences in this context, see Darwall 2003a.

### **Suarez on Moral Obligation**

To provide background for Pufendorf, it will be useful to begin briefly with Francisco Suarez.31 Suarez was in many ways a classical (Thomist) natural lawyer, but he thought that Aquinas's view left out an essential element: morality's distinctive power to bind or obligate those subject to it. To account for this, he argued, it is insufficient to show that acting immorally is against our end or nature as rational beings. Telling falsehoods may be "repugnant" in itself to rational nature, but this repugnancy is insufficient to lay us under a moral obligation to tell the truth (Suarez 1944: 181–183). Morality cannot therefore be identified with a teleological structure, as in Thomas's version of natural law, because nothing like this could explain morality's power to obligate. It does not provide a reason of the right kind.

To understand morality as obligating, Suarez believed, it is necessary to see its laws as commands that are addressed to us by a superior authority, that is, by God. Several ideas are packed into this. First, because "ordering pertains to the will," moral norms or laws must aim to direct a will (1944: 66). Only thus can morality have a "binding force" (66, 67). Second, moral norms are God's will as addressed to us. Suarez's idea is not that God simply wants or wills us to act in certain ways. If that were his will, we could not fail to comply ("all these precepts would be executed"), since God is omnipotent (55). Rather God wills "to bind" his subjects by addressing them in a certain way, by commanding them (55). Third, the commands that create morality are addressed to human beings as free and rational. Morality can exist "only in view of some rational creature; for law is imposed only upon a nature that is free, and has for its subject-matter free acts alone" (37). So, fourth, although moral norms "provid[e] motive force and impe[l]," they do so by providing a distinctive kind of reason that wouldn't have existed but for God's having addressed us and our wills in this distinctive way (in our terms, given us a second-personal reason) (54). Finally, fifth, this second-personal address makes moral obligations something we are accountable for complying with. If we do not "voluntarily observe the law," therefore, we are culpable ("legal culprits in the sight of God") (132).

<sup>31</sup> Francisco Suarez (1548–1617) was an important late scholastic thinker in the tradition of moral and political thought that derived from Thomas Aquinas. For a useful introduction and selections, see Schneewind 1990.

It is thus essential to Suarez's picture that morality derives from a distinctive second-personal relationship between one rational will and another. Moral norms derive from claims that are made will to will and that purport to give the addressee a distinctive reason for acting he wouldn't otherwise have had, a second-personal reason, and to place him in the position of accountability for so acting. Of course, it is no less essential to Suarez's view that the requisite second-personal relation is asymmetric, that of a superior to an inferior will. There can be "moral government" only through the existence of rational creatures, that is, rational beings who, because they are created, are (in their nature, he thinks) subject to the authority of their Creator (1944: 37–38).32 Still, morality exists only through the possibility of a second-personal address in which one rational agent can give another a distinctive kind of reason he wouldn't otherwise have had and which he is thereby accountable for acting on.

### **Pufendorf on Moral Obligation**

We find these same themes in Pufendorf, but put more sharply and outside the Thomist framework.33 The increased acuity comes from Pufendorf 's distinction between physical and moral "entities": the difference, he claims, between how things stand in nature without the address of a commanding will and "superadded" moral features that result from this form of address (1934: 4–7). "Moral entities are produced" through God's "imposition" of his will in commands (5). Thus are "moral entities" superadded to the physical realm—the moral law and moral reasons are created.

Pufendorf calls the "active force" of moral entities its being "made clear to men along what line they should govern their liberty of action, and that in a special way men are made capable of receiving good or evil and

<sup>32</sup> There is, of course, a deep tension between the idea that it is part of the nature of being created that one is subject to the authority of a creator and the idea that, as Suarez also thinks, accountability is essentially a second-personal relation for reasons that, if they are not clear by now, should become so by the end of our discussion of Pufendorf.

<sup>33</sup> Samuel Freiherr von Pufendorf (1632–1694) was, along with Grotius, one of the two most important sources of the early modern theory of natural law. For a very useful introduction and selections, see Schneewind 1990. See also the important discussion of Pufendorf in Schneewind 1998.

of directing certain actions towards other persons with a particular effect" (1934: 6). The "special way" men can "receive" good or evil and "direct" actions toward others "with a particular effect" refers to accountability, specifically, the standing to address and acknowledge warranted (or legitimate) sanctions.

The key idea is that the distinctive second-personal character of God's relation to those he commands makes addressees accountable for obedience. Once God addresses us in this way, our actions and various of their effects are imputable to us. When, consequently, God makes us aware of an evil we will suffer if we violate his commands, he is not merely threatening or coercing us. He is putting us on notice of warranted sanctions in a way that is itself an authority-warranted expression of the same second-personal accountability relation that God presupposes in commanding us in the first place and that we presuppose when we acknowledge his commands. It is what his holding us accountable consists in.

When God addresses his will to free and rational beings, he makes us "moral causes," agents to whom actions and their effects can be imputed and for which we are thereby accountable. Of course, he must also have made us free and rational, since this is necessary for imputability. But it is not sufficient, since imputability, as Pufendorf thinks of it, entails accountability, and that requires imposition. The formal nature of a moral action, he says, "consists of its 'imputativity'," "whereby the effect of a voluntary action can be imputed to an agent." Whether the effects be "good or evil," Pufendorf continues, "he must be responsible for both" (1934: 68). This is the "primary axiom in morals": "a man can be asked for a reckoning" for anything in his power. Or, equivalently, "any action controllable according to a moral law, the accomplishment or avoidance of which is within the power of a man, may be imputed to him" (70). According to Pufendorf, then, when God addresses his will to us free and rational beings, he simultaneously creates the moral law and makes us "moral causes" by making us accountable for following it.

Being under moral obligations, then, is not simply a matter of standing under categorical oughts, but, as well, of being obligated to (answerable to) someone for complying with these oughts. Moral obligation, consequently, depends upon the authority for a second-personal address that presupposes and can also generate the requisite accountability relations, as Pufendorf believes, to God. Pufendorf agrees with Suarez (and, he points out, with Hobbes), that this can only come from a will. He quotes with approval Hobbes's definition of law as "a precept in which the reason for obedience is drawn from the will of the person prescribing it" (1934: 88). And he also agrees that law can only be imposed on free and rational wills and, then, only by a form of second-personal address.34 A law is "a decree by which a superior obligates a subject." And a "decree" comes into existence only in "being communicated to the subject in such a way that he recognizes he must bend himself to it" (89). Morality, with its distinctive form of accountability, therefore, can only exist because of the distinctive demands that one (kind of) free and rational will can make on another.

As Pufendorf 's critics, notably Leibniz, pointed out, however, and as Pufendorf himself affirmed, even God's commands cannot create the whole structure of accountability *ex nihilo.* As Cudworth put the point, "It was never heard of, that any one founded all his Authority of Commanding others, and others Obligation or Duty to Obey his Commands, in a Law of his own making, that men should be Required, Obliged, or Bound to Obey him" (1996: I.ii.3).35 Without its already being true that we should obey God's commands, these cannot obligate us to perform specific actions. Pufendorf acknowledges this point. We could not be obligated by God's command, he says, unless "we owed beforehand obedience to its author" (Pufendorf 1934: 89).

This is an instance of the general point we noted in Chapters 1 and 3 (and a consequence of Strawson's Point—this instance might be called Cudworth's Point). Since second-personal demands do not reduce to, and cannot be derived in any simple way from, propositions of value or nonsecond-personal norms of conduct, any obligation to God that results from his commands requires a normative second-personal accountability relation already existing in the background. As stated in Chapter 3: "Second-personal authority out, second-personal authority in."36

<sup>34</sup> That law can only bind free rational wills is a major theme of Pufendorf 1934: 52–65.

<sup>35</sup> Leibniz made similar arguments against Pufendorf in his *Opinion on the Principles of Pufendorf* (1989: 70–75).

<sup>36</sup> I take this to be a problem for versions of the Divine Command Theory that attempt to ground God's authority to command in his goodness. That God is infinitely good could explain why we should be guided by his will as perfect advice. But it could not explain our being accountable or responsible to God and, hence, God's having the authority to command us in this sense. For an example of such a version of theological voluntarism, see Adams 1999: 249–276.

But what can provide the required second-personal background, according to Pufendorf? The terms in which Pufendorf draws the distinction between moral and physical entities apparently prevent him from holding, with Suarez, that created rational beings are in their nature, and independently of imposition, the Creator's moral subjects in the sense of being rightly ruled by him. Moral entities "do not arise out of the intrinsic nature of the physical properties of things, but . . . are superadded at the will of intelligent entities" by imposition (Pufendorf 1934: 5–6). So there can't be a more fundamental obligation or accountability relation grounded in the natures of these different kinds of rational beings from which God's imposed will draws its authority over us. Without that, however, it remains unclear, by Pufendorf 's own admission, how God's impositions can have the background authority needed to impose obligations (Cudworth's Point).37

Pufendorf tries to fix this problem by arguing that we are obligated to obey God out of gratitude, since we are indebted to him for our "very being" (101). But this creates problems of its own. If we are permitted to help ourselves to an independently standing obligation of gratitude in order to give authority to the structure of command, then why suppose that all other obligations require command for their moral force? What is special about gratitude? Once a voluntarist makes a concession on this obligation, why should he not make it also on others?

This was perhaps the most fundamental problem that voluntarists like Pufendorf faced. They wanted to hold that morality requires a distinctive form of accountability that derives from one kind of will's addressing a demand to another. But they also held that this is impossible without a normative structure in which two wills already have the requisite authority relations, independently of any second-personal interaction. This is what makes the relevant demand an order that obligates the inferior to obey as the superior's subject. But assuming this prior moral relation creates two kinds of problems. First, there is the problem just noted: assuming any prior moral relation raises the question of why other relations can't be taken for granted also, for example, promiser to promisee

<sup>37</sup> I don't mean to imply of course that Suarez's position is at all plausible.

or parent to child. Second, as we shall presently see, in holding that any rational agent God addresses is thereby accountable for obedience, the voluntarists made their views subject to pressure from the idea of rational accountability in ways that can seem to cut against theological voluntarism.38 God can hold free and rational agents accountable for following his commands, Pufendorf held, only if exercising the capacity for free and rational deliberation would lead agents to determine themselves by reasons for obedience, which reasons they recognize in this second-personal address. But this requires that free and rational (second-personal) deliberation already involves an acknowledgment of an independently established moral relation of inferior to superior that gives God's commands authority in the first place. And what might guarantee that?

### **Accountability, Moral Reasons, and the Second-Person Standpoint**

Now we get to Pufendorf 's Point, and here we have to consider a fundamental distinction that Pufendorf makes between the goods and evils that can attend moral violations and the way these enter into deliberation.39 Many things can "influence the will to turn to one side" or the other, but nonmoral evils "bear down the will as by some natural weight." Obligation, however, "affects the will morally," so that it "is forced of itself to weigh its own actions, and to judge itself worthy of some censure, unless it conforms to a prescribed rule" (1934: 91). Obligation thus "differs in a special way from coercion."40 Although both obligation and coercion "point out some object of terror, the latter only shakes the will with an external force," since what moves the will is only "the sense of the impending evil." "An obligation," however, "forces a man to acknowl-

<sup>38</sup> In effect, they committed themselves to constraints of intelligible second-personal address that pushed their views in the direction of Grotius's doctrine that the law of nature expresses a "moral necessity, of any act from its agreement or disagreement with a rational nature" (Grotius 1925: I.x.i). A remark of Karl Graf Ballestrem's led me to see this.

<sup>39</sup> There are subtleties here concerning a tension between Pufendorf 's theory of the will as always having to aim at some good and his claim that "whatever we do from obligation," we do from "an intrinsic impulse of the mind" (1934: 8), which I cannot enter into here. I discuss them in Darwall 2003a.

<sup>40</sup> This corresponds to Hart's famous distinction between being obligated and being obliged, which he makes in the course of criticizing the legal positivism of John Austin (Hart 1961: 6–8).

edge of himself that the evil, which has been pointed out to the person who deviates from an announced rule, falls upon him justly."41

This is an initial statement of Pufendorf 's Point. It is not yet obvious, however, how, so stated, Pufendorf 's Point can help solve his problem. How does the distinction between, as Hart would later put it, being obligated and being obliged, help to explain obligation's ability to move the will "of itself" differently from coercion? How does it help to note that in the former case one acknowledges that the evil that is threatened if one violates the moral law falls on one "justly"? (Hart 1961: 6–8). It seems that one could acknowledge that God, or anyone else for that matter, has the authority to make a demand of one without yet having to grant that this creates a reason for one to act as the other demands. How does this force the will "of itself" to give the demand intrinsic weight?

To see what Pufendorf must be getting at, we need to distinguish between merely external censure or blame, even censure that addresses a demand that one believes to be warranted from the other's point of view, and internal blame, that is, the self-reactive attitude of guilt. Blame is purely external when it comes from outside and is not accepted. It seems possible to accept even the fact that another is warranted in a demand she expresses as censure without yet accepting the blame or censure itself. When, however, one accepts and acknowledges blame or censure, one owns the blaming address of the censuring person second-personally; one credits that imputation, and thus also blames oneself.42 One sees oneself as being to blame. One thereby holds oneself responsible in making the demand of oneself from a second-personal standpoint one shares with the other. Pufendorf 's Point, then, is that *in holding people responsible, we are committed to the assumption that theycan hold themselves responsible by self-addressed demands from a perspective that we and theyshare.* For us to blame them for noncompliance, we must see them as able to blame themselves from the same perspective, the standpoint of free and rational members of the moral community. So Pufendorf 's Point can solve his problem only if violating the moral law threatens not merely evils that are only externally related to the violation, but also one's own censure.

<sup>41</sup> Ibid. Cf. the discussion of the difference between coercion and second-personal address in Chapter 3.

<sup>42</sup> Compare the remark of Hanoch Yerushalmi, quoted by Laura Blumenfeld: "Acknowledgment is... accepting responsibility. It's when you 'own your own guilt' " (2002: 292).

But cannot even internal blame be externalized? Is the worry supposed to be that I cannot avoid my own gaze, and so my own blame, in a way that I can avoid others' if I stay out of their sight? What if I could take a pill that would wipe out the memory of the violation? To solve his problem, Pufendorf 's Point must be that although a pill might expunge the psychic state of internal blame, it couldn't expunge one's being to blame, as one acknowledges here and now (second-personally) one is.43 In sincerely making this judgment of oneself, second-personally, one is already in the process of holding oneself accountable for one's conduct with respect to the relevant law. One sees not just that a demand of oneself is warranted from some other person's standpoint (say, God's). Taken by itself, even that might give one no motive; so far, it just concerns what that person can justifiably feel or do. Rather, in taking a second-personal standpoint on oneself and acknowledging blame, one makes the demand of oneself. And in making that judgment, one implicitly acknowledges an adequate motive, a conclusive reason, not to violate the demand. As we saw earlier in the chapter, it seems incoherent to judge that someone (whether oneself or someone else) is to blame for something that one thinks she has or had conclusive reasons for doing. When, consequently, a free and rational deliberating agent acknowledges she would be to blame for doing something, she thereby acknowledges conclusive reasons not to do it and, in a sense, holds herself accountable.

This picture links accountability centrally to the reasons free and rational beings have for living by the moral law. On this picture, recognizing moral reasons is itself part of moral agents' active participation in a scheme of accountability, part of their holding themselves accountable for guidance by the relevant norms.

Once we view things this way, significant pressures develop on the sort of voluntarism that Pufendorf put forward. Most obviously, accountability is no longer simply to God, but also, in a sense, to oneself. It may still be, of course, that God rightly claims, uniquely, the right to punish and to judge. Maybe only he has all the evidence or uniquely has the authority to render final judgments. But even these ideas may also come under pressure if this punishment itself includes self-condemnation

<sup>43</sup> Cf. my discussion of Mill's distinction between internal and external sanctions from chapter 3 of *Utilitarianism* in Chapter 7 below.

and a sense of guilt, since these involve internal, and not just external, blame.

To the extent that we conceive of moral agents as capable of internal blame, we must think of them as capable of taking part in second-personal moral community. For Pufendorf, each agent forms such a community with God alone, with God being accountable to no one. But Pufendorf also thinks that agents can form such a community with God, and hence be truly accountable to him, only if they are capable of acknowledging God's censure internally, hence only if they can in this way hold themselves responsible and be accountable also to themselves. In relating to God, one takes a second-personal standpoint on oneself as a person, and one will have this capacity only if one is also capable of entering into a community of mutually accountable persons. Pufendorf does not himself draw the conclusion, of course, but it follows that only beings capable of entering into relations of mutual accountability can be moral agents. Or, as we might also put it, human beings can individually have moral community with God only if they have the capacity to be a moral community together themselves.44

We should view voluntarists like Pufendorf as putting forward but one *conception* of a more general *concept* of morality as accountability. Any interpretation of this general concept must see morality as grounded in the possibility of second-personal community. What characterizes a voluntarist conception is that it takes a moral hierarchy for granted and then derives the rest of morality (by fiat) from that. As we have seen, however, tendencies within the general idea of morality as accountability put heavy pressure on a voluntarist interpretation of that idea. To distinguish between moral obligation and coercion, Pufendorf required an account of moral agents' distinctive capacity for selfcensure from a shared second-person standpoint and its role in free rational deliberation. But this effectively assumes that to be accountable to God, moral agents must also be accountable to themselves.

It is implicit in the very idea of one free and rational will addressing a claim to another (as free and rational) that the addresser is committed to the addressee's capacity, as second-personally competent, to accept the claim and freely determine herself by it. But what claims can one free and

<sup>44</sup> It is important, again, that as Postema (1995) and Korsgaard (1996e) have stressed, this involves seeing the moral point of view as a first-person plural (and I here add, second-personal) standpoint, as one from which we address demands to each of us.

rational will make on another and reasonably expect reciprocation? I argue in Chapters 10 and 11 that the answer to this question is provided by morality as equal accountability, the idea that second-personal competence grounds an equal second-personal authority.45 It follows that we human beings can enter (individually) into moral community with God only if we have the authority to form a moral community ourselves as mutually accountable free and rational persons: a Kantian "realm of ends."

### **CI and the Golden Rule as Second-Personal**

I have been arguing that second-personal accountability is part of the concept of moral obligation. When we hold one another accountable for complying with moral requirements, moreover, the addressers presuppose that the addressees are second-personally competent to accept authoritative moral demands and freely act on them by making the demands on themselves second-personally. In Chapter 9, I argue that this is the deep idea underlying what Kant calls "autonomy of the will" and supporting his thesis that moral obligation must bottom out in a formal principle of the will, like the Categorical Imperative (CI), which moral agents can use to determine moral demands, and determine themselves to comply with them, in their own reasoning. To close this chapter, I would like briefly to illustrate that the CI and related injunctions like the Golden Rule are themselves most intuitively interpreted in second-personal terms.

Hobbes, for example, formulates a principle he claims to be "intelligible even to the meanest capacity," as follows: *"Do not that to another, which thou wouldst not have done to thyself"* (Hobbes 1994: XV.35). If we understand "thou wouldst not have done to thyself" in terms of desire or preference, we get very strange results. Jones, let us say, is in a position to peel me a grape (as I am to peel one for him). I prefer the state in which Jones peels me a grape to one in which he forbears to peel me a grape. In that sense, I would have him not (or in Hobbes's English:

<sup>45</sup> This will turn Anscombe's famous claims in "Modern Moral Philosophy" (1958) on their head. Although I agree with Anscombe that morality is inconceivable without the idea of addressable demands, I maintain that her claim that they require divinely addressed demands ultimately overturns itself in the way I have indicated. I am indebted here to Kate Abramson.

"would not have him")46 forbear to peel me a grape. Should we then understand Hobbes's Golden Rule as enjoining me not to forbear peeling a grape for Jones (as I am equally in a position to peel him a grape). That seems an obviously perverse way to interpret the principle. Clearly I do no wrong if I do not peel the grape for Jones, as he does no wrong also, if, having appropriately corresponding preferences, he does not peel the grape for me.47

It is clearly more intuitively plausible to interpret "wouldst not have done to thyself" in terms of what one would expect or demand that others not do to one or object to or resent their doing (or perhaps, what one would want to be able to claim or demand that they not do). Although I would prefer that others peel me grapes, and hence, that they not forbear doing so, I certainly don't object to their not doing so, or demand that they do so. As I wouldn't (want to) claim this from Jones, I do not violate the Golden Rule if I don't peel a grape for him.

A familiar way to think of the Golden Rule is in terms of *acceptance.* If you wouldn't or couldn't accept other people doing something to you, it is often said, then you shouldn't do it to them. But what does acceptance mean in this context? It is frequently pointed out in discussions of egoism that there is a theoretical sense in which an egoist can accept the totally self-regarding conduct of others even when it disadvantages her; she can accept that it is justified. That others are no less justified in their egoistic conduct than she is in hers just follows from egoism of this kind's being a universalistic position. All parties to the debate usually agree that she doesn't have to accept it in a more practical sense to accept it theoretically.

But what is it for someone to accept something practically? If it just means desiring or preferring it to alternatives, or at least not dispreferring it, then we are back in the same terrain we were two paragraphs ago with the same problems. Perhaps 'accept' means something like "not resist." But this also gives strange results. Whenever I play a competitive game, like ping-pong, there is a perfectly natural sense in which I am resisting

<sup>46</sup> If we don't interpret Hobbes this way, we get an even stranger result, namely, that if I would not prefer him to forbear peeling me a grape (if, say, I were indifferent to that prospect), then I should not forbear to peel him a grape.

<sup>47</sup> Scanlon makes a similar point (1998: 170), noting that this is Kant's objection also in *Groundwork* (1996b: 430n).

my opponent's efforts to win points. So should I not play to win points against her?

A moment's reflection shows, I think, that the most natural way to take 'accept' in "don't do to others what you wouldn't or couldn't accept their doing to you," is in terms of the second-personal circle of concepts we identified at the outset of this book. What I can accept in these terms is what I would not object to or claim or demand otherwise. On this natural interpretation, the Golden Rule is second-personal.48 It asserts what we might think of as a fundamental principle of the reasonable, that is, as Rawls (1980) and Scanlon (1998) understand this idea. One should not act in ways that one demands or expects (or would demand or expect) that others not act, or equivalently, in ways that one would resent or object to. If I am going to object to others' stepping on my feet (and thus demand that they not do so), then I must not step on their feet either. Lincoln's famous remark, "As I would not be a slave, so I would not be a master" (1989: 484) is along the same lines: As I would not allow others a master's claim on me so should I not make a master's claim on others.

Or again, consider the Formula of Universal Law of the CI (FUL): "Act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law of nature" (Kant 1996b: 421).49 There are delicate issues about how to interpret Kant's idea of a maxim and FUL in light of it, and about how to understand FUL, so interpreted, in relation to the Formula of Humanity (FH) and Formula of the Realm of Ends (FRE), which Kant says are equivalent. We can hardly sort this all out here. In Chapter 12, however, I argue that the best way of interpreting the CI in its various formulations is within a contractualist framework (grounded in the equal dignity of free and rational agents that we presuppose in the second-person standpoint). The intuitive idea is that,

<sup>48</sup> For a fascinating study of Hobbes's moral philosophy that makes his version of the Golden Rule, what she calls Hobbes's "reciprocity theorem" central (understood in terms of what we would or would not blame or "fault" others for), and treats the desire to justify ourselves to one another as a central aspect of Hobbes's moral psychology, see Lloyd forthcoming.

<sup>49</sup> A key difference with the Golden Rule (one Kant himself notes [1996b: 430n]) is that what one must be able to will is universal following of a maxim, not just a particular action.

when we regulate ourselves by the CI, we accept and comply with demands we think it sensible (reasonable) to make on everyone from the shared standpoint of a community of equal free and rational persons. This makes second-personal authority and competence fundamental. What is most basic is the dignity of free and rational persons, understood as their (second-personal) authority to make demands on one another as equals.

—immanuel kant, metaphysical first principles of the doctrine of virtue

Morality as equal accountability conceives of moral relations in terms of equal *respect.*1 In seeing ourselves as mutually accountable, we accord one another the standing to demand certain conduct of each other as equal members of the moral community. In this chapter, I argue that recognition of this authority is an irreducibly second-personal form of respect. Conceived in Kantian terms as "common laws" for a "kingdom of ends" (Kant 1996b: 433), moral requirements structure and give expression to the distinctive value that persons equally have: *dignity,* a "worth that has no price" (1996d: 462). This chapter argues that both the dignity of persons and the respect that is its fitting response have an irreducibly second-personal character. Our dignity includes the standing to hold one another to our moral obligations toward each other, and respect for this second-personal standing is itself second-personal.

Dignity enters in two distinct places in morality as equal accountability. First, in holding ourselves accountable to one another at all, we give each other an authority to address demands to us as equal members of the moral community, even when the content of those demands extends be-

<sup>1</sup> This chapter draws heavily on Darwall 2004b.

yond the treatment of persons. And second, we respect our dignity as persons more specifically when the demands concern how we must treat one another.

My method in this chapter is analytical. I simply draw out consequences I take to be implicit in our going moral conception. Later, I attempt to vindicate these aspects of our conception, arguing in Chapter 10 that we are committed to the common dignity (second-personal authority) of free and rational agents as a presupposition (normative felicity condition) of the address of any second-personal reason at all. Then in Chapter 11, I attempt to locate second-personal reasons in an overall theory of practical reasons.

### **Attitudes and Objects**

Respect is the fitting response to dignity, as esteem is to the estimable, desire is to the desirable, and so on.2 Just as reasons of the right kind for desire and esteem must be drawn from the distinctive ways these attitudes relate to their characteristic objects, the desirable and the estimable, respectively, so it is also with respect. The distinctive object of the kind of respect with which we are concerned, *recognition respect,* is dignity or authority.3 Recognition respect differs from other attitudes, however, in that it can be mandated and not just warranted by its object. Someone who fails to esteem your estimable qualities may not give you the response youdeserve, but esteem is nothing youor anyone else can expect or demand. Not so with respect of your dignity.

The dignity of persons, Kant says, is that "by which" we "*exac*[t] respect," that is, claim or, as Kant also says, "demand" it from one another as rational beings (1996d: 434–357).4 But what is it to demand respect as

<sup>2</sup> Just as in desiring something we see it as desirable, or in esteeming something we see it as estimable, so in respecting something we see it as having dignity or authority. Note that what I have been calling "reasons of the right kind" for an attitude concern whether the attitude "fits" its object in the sense that things are, evaluatively or normatively, as they seem from the perspective of that attitude. "Fittingness" reasons make it the case that an attitude is fitting to its object in this sense. See D'Arms and Jacobson 2000a and 2000b.

<sup>3</sup> For the distinction between *recognition* and *appraisal respect,* see the next section.

<sup>4</sup> Stress added to "exact" and removed from "respect." I should note that what I am presenting is only one interpretation of Kant's writings on dignity and respect. Kant sometimes writes as if dignity were a value that can be realized by rational beings only when a person, and what enables us to make this demand? And what is respect for this dignity that it may be thus demanded? I maintain that the key to answering these questions is the irreducibly second-personal character of both our dignity and the respect that is its fitting response. The dignity of persons, I contend, is the second-personal authority of an equal: the standing to make claims and demands of one another as equal free and rational agents, including as a member of a community of mutually accountable equals. And respect for this dignity is an acknowledgment of this authority that is also second-personal.5 It is always implicitly reciprocal, if only in imagination. As 'respect"s root '*respiceˇre*' suggests, it is a "looking back" that reciprocates a real or imagined second-personal address, even if only from oneself.

To say that the dignity of persons is second-personal is to say that it cannot be wholly summed into (non-second-personal) values or norms, say, into a set of requirements on conduct that are rooted in our common nature as persons or even into certain ways that persons must and must not be treated (Kamm 1989, 1992; Nagel 1995). It also involves an equal authority as persons to claim or demand compliance with such requirements. It is worth recalling here Rawls's expression of this idea when he says that persons are "self-originating sources of valid claims" (1980: 546). Joel Feinberg makes a companion point, which I develop in this chapter, when he says that it is "the activity of claiming" that "makes for selfrespect and respect for others" (1980: 155).

I believe, indeed, that it is our equal second-personal authority that is most fundamental and that substantive constraints on conduct derive from this authority. In my view, what we "owe to each other" as equal moral persons is best accounted for within a contractualist framework that, as I argue in Chapter 12, is itself grounded in the equal second-personal authority to which we are committed in the second-person standpoint.

they follow the moral law, as opposed to a value or standing they have by virtue of the capacity for moral action. For example, he writes of "the idea of the dignity of a rational being, who obeys no law other than that which he at the same time gives" (1996b: 434). I have been helped here by discussion with Oliver Sensen.

<sup>5</sup> The second-personal character of (recognition) respect for persons has been overlooked by the discussion of respect over the last thirty-five years, including in my own work. See, for example, Buss 1999b; Cranor 1975; Darwall 1977; Dillon 1995, 1997; Downie and Telfer 1970; Hill 1997, 1998; Hudson 1980.

### **Appraisal versus Recognition Respect**

It will help to begin by distinguishing the distinctive kind of respect we are concerned with, recognition respect, from other attitudes to which 'respect' can also refer and from other responses in the neighborhood. Consider, for example, the sense in which one can be said to have more or less respect for someone, either as a person or in some specific capacity (as a philosopher, say), or be said to have gained or lost respect for someone. In these contexts, 'respect' refers to a kind of *esteem.*

Of course, esteem can also take forms we would never dream of calling "respect." Pimples and unpopularity can wreak havoc with adolescent self-esteem, for example, without necessarily threatening self-respect. Esteem concerns what we admire, look up to, envy, or wish to acquire or emulate. Many such excellences cannot intelligibly be objects of respect of any sort, at least, not without some long and unobvious story. If the popular kids' imagined unblemished faces are seen to result from differences in conduct (hygiene, say) or seem an expression of their more sterling characters, then this can support a sense of differential respect.6 But without some such connection, it cannot.

The esteem we call "respect"—henceforth, *appraisal respect*—is an assessment of someone's conduct or character or of something that somehow involves these.7 Appraisal respect for someone as a person is moral esteem: approbation for her as a moral agent. We can have appraisal respect for people in more specific capacities as well, but even though this differs from moral esteem, it still concerns the person's conduct in the relevant capacity. Thus, although appraisal respect for someone as a tennis player differs from respect for her as a person, neither is it the same thing as esteem for her tennis-playing skills or achievements. If one thoroughly objects to how she conducts herself on the court, say, because she seeks to gain unfair advantage by manipulating the rules, this will tend to undermine respect for her as a tennis player. It will tarnish, even if it does not otherwise diminish, her victories and achievements.

*Appraisal respect is esteem that is merited or earned by conduct or character.* By contrast, the respect we can demand as persons regardless of

<sup>7</sup> I take the terms "appraisal respect" and "recognition respect" from Darwall 1977.

<sup>6</sup> Another possibility is that, without assaulting my esteem for my conduct or character, such things can help undermine one's sense or feeling of one's worth or dignity as a person, despite a belief to the contrary. On this point, see Dillon 1997.

our merit is no form of esteem at all. When we think that even scoundrels have a dignity that entitles them to respectful forms of treatment (say, in holding them accountable, as Strawson says [1968: 93]), we clearly have something other than esteem in mind. The idea is not that personhood is somehow an admirable quality: "Granted, he stole hardworking people's pension funds, but at least he's a person." What is in play here is not appraisal but recognition.

The object of recognition respect is not excellence or merit; it is dignity or authority. Recognition respect concerns, not how something is to be evaluated or appraised, but how our relations to it are to be regulated or governed. Broadly speaking, we respect something in the recognition sense when we give it standing (authority) in our relations to it. Since the authority that persons have as such is fundamentally second-personal, respect for it must be second-personal also; it must involve acknowledgment.8

There are forms of recognition respect, however, that are not fundamentally second-personal at all, namely, whenever the authority respect recognizes is not second-personal. In these cases, the relevant authority can be recognized without having to be acknowledged. In many of these instances, moreover, the authority can be merited or earned. But even when that is so, respect for the authority differs from esteem for any form of merit.

We saw in Chapter 3, for example, how when one person attempts to give another reasons to believe something through testimony, his (second-personal) standing to do so can depend upon or be defeated by his epistemic authority, by how reliable a witness he is or can be taken to be. To be sure, the standing we accord one another in collaborative theoretical reasoning is itself second-personal (Pettit and Smith 1996). But the epistemic authority that can defeat it is not. And my current point is that it is possible fully to recognize epistemic authority without any form of second-personal acknowledgment. One can respect the knowledge or wisdom one overhears in another person's solitary musings and regulate one's own private reasoning by them. Here one respects the other's epistemic authority without acknowledging any second-personal claim he makes, even implicitly.

<sup>8</sup> I take it that, unlike recognition, acknowledgment is always to someone, if only implicitly and if only to oneself.

Even so, respect for someone's epistemic authority differs from esteem for his epistemic virtues. The latter shows itself in and partly just is a positive appraisal of him as a cognizer or of his contributions to collaborative inquiry. The former, however, is realized in our epistemic conduct in relation to him, for example, giving his views weight or authority in deciding what to believe ourselves.9

Or consider the authority that we give trusted advisors. This also can be merited or earned. We have recognition respect for an advisor when we give him standing in our deliberations about what to do or, at least, about what to believe we should do. The situation here is on all fours with the theoretical case. Even if there is a kind of second-personal authority involved in the giving and receiving of advice, especially when the advisor simply recommends a course of action without giving reasons, this authority is nonetheless taken to rest on and be defeasible by an authority that is not second-personal at all—the advisor's practical wisdom. If I come to believe that someone I had trusted is no longer a particularly good judge of reasons that bear on my practical situation, or that he is but that he can no longer be trusted to tell me what he really thinks, then I will no longer have any reason to treat his advice with recognition respect. But here again, my disesteem for his advising abilities is not the same thing as my resulting recognition contempt. The former shows itself in and partly just is a negative appraisal of him as an advisor. The latter is shown in how I conduct my own deliberations in relation to him and his advice, giving his views little weight in deciding what to do or in forming my beliefs about what reasons there are to decide one way or another.

Yet another example is the kind of implicit respect that, as Sarah Buss (1999b) has pointed out, is typically involved in the experience of shame. We experience shame, as we noted in Chapter 4, when we are brought

<sup>9</sup> Here, however, is a problem case at the margins of the distinction between recognition and appraisal respect. Just as one can show recognition respect for something or someone in regulating one's beliefs, no less than one's actions, it would seem that one can in regulating one's esteem as well. So why isn't appropriately regulating one's thinking about what to feel by a proper appreciation of someone's character an instance of recognition respect? And if it is, then what is the difference between that and the resulting esteem (appraisal respect) for the person's character? Even here, we might want to distinguish the two, but the difference seems little if any in this case. I am indebted to Mark LeBar for this suggestion.

to see ourselves as others see (or might see) us, and this view is problematic for us in certain ways—say, because it involves disdain or something like it or because it reveals an aspect of ourselves that we would prefer to keep private.10 Shame is not the fear of disdain; neither is it an awareness of being viewed with it or in a way that unveils. Rather, shame is feeling as if a view of oneself as shameful is to be credited. It is the experience of seeming to be correctly seen in some disturbing way by recognizing (though not necessarily acknowledging) the view of oneself one gets from the other's perspective. This is why Buss says that shame involves respect. Shame feels as if the other can see one as one really is as if she has this competence and authority. So far, however, the authority seems entirely epistemic (in a sufficiently broad sense); it is like the authority one recognizes in taking another's epistemic attitudes seriously.

What makes respect for these different forms of authority structurally similar to, but still importantly different from, that for an authority to claim or demand is that they concern non-second-personal reasons. Respect for epistemic authority need involve no (even implicit) acknowledgment of any (even implicit) claim. To be sure, the contexts in which we normally show recognition respect for theoretical knowledge, practical wisdom, and similar forms of authority are frequently second-personal. Testimony, advice, mutual inquiry, and addressed criticisms all make a kind of claim on an addressee's attention, judgment, or reasoning. But in these cases, the relevant second-personal standing flows directly from a more basic epistemic or epistemic-like authority that is not itself essentially second-personal, one that can be respected in contexts that do not involve (even an imagined) acknowledgment of any (even imagined) claim or demand for respect.

Any standing to address second-personal reasons, however, is fundamentally second-personal. When a sergeant orders her platoon to fall in, her troops take it that the reason she thereby gives them derives entirely from their normative relations, from her authority to give them orders. That, again, is the point of Hobbes's famous distinction between "command" and "counsel" (1983: XIV.1). The sergeant addresses reasons that would not have existed but for her authority to address them in this way. And the only way that one can fully respect such a second-personal authority is second-personally.

<sup>10</sup> On the importance of the latter, again, see Velleman 2001.

Similarly, I believe that recognition respect for someone as a person is also second-personal. It is an acknowledgment of someone's standing to address and be addressed second-personal reasons rooted in the dignity of persons, where this standing is also second-personal all the way down. 'Person' is a "forensic term," as Locke said; it is conceptually related to accountability (1975: 346). According to morality as equal accountability, to be a person just is to have the competence and standing to address demands as persons to other persons, and to be addressed by them, within a community of mutually accountable equals. This second-personal competence gives all persons an equal dignity, irrespectively of their merit. We therefore respect another as a person when we accord him this standing in our relations to him.

### **Respect versus Care**

Recognition respect thus involves no evaluation or appraisal of excellence or merit, even of someone's merits as a person. It is, rather, a way of valuing someone intrinsically, in and for himself. In respecting someone's dignity, we respect and value him. But respect is not the only way of valuing someone in himself or for his own sake. Caring or benevolent concern is another.11 It is important, therefore, to be clear about the differences between respect and care, since these ground importantly different moral philosophical ideas.

Like respect, care takes individuals as its object. But whereas respecting someone entails relating to her as a being with a dignity, caring for someone involves viewing her as a being with a welfare. In caring for someone, we want certain states—whichever will benefit her.12 Respect, however, is attitude- or conduct-, rather than state-regarding. In respecting someone, we are disposed to regulate our conduct in relation to her—to do what is called for by her dignity.

<sup>11</sup> By 'care' here I mean the sort of "sympathetic concern" I discuss in Darwall 2002b, especially chapter 3. There are other senses, for example, when we are enjoined by the law to take "due care," where what is involved is a form of respect. I am indebted here to an anonymous reader for the Press. Also, relationships of mutual concern, at least between those with second-personal competence, such as friendships, reciprocal love relationships, and so on, also involve an element of respect of part of what it is to relate to the other in that distinctive caring way. Here I am indebted to Joseph Raz and Susan Wolf.

<sup>12</sup> This is a central theme of Darwall 2002b.

Reasons for acting that are rooted in respect are *second-personal, agentregarding,* and *agent-relative.* Respect for persons is a responsiveness to what someone can claim by virtue of being an agent with second-personal competence. What we attend to here is not (at least, not primarily) what is for someone's welfare or good, but, among other things, what she herself values and holds good from her point of view as an equal independent agent. In so doing, we acknowledge her (and her authority) as free and equal. We may rightly think, for example, that unhealthy habits are harmful for someone and thus contrary to her welfare, but we may think as well that respect tells against exerting undue pressure to induce her to change. Concern for her and her welfare may lead us to want her to change, and to want to help her do so, even while respect for her dignity restrains us. A person's values and preferences can give others reasons of respect to permit her to promote them (and, I have elsewhere argued, give her reasons to pursue them herself), whether or not the resulting states would be beneficial or good in some other way from an agent-neutral point of view, or indeed, whether she has any other reason to promote them at all (Darwall 2001). And, because they are second-personal, respect's reasons are also fundamentally agent-relative.13 They concern how others must relate to us and our authority to demand this.

Reasons of care, on the other hand, are *third-personal, welfareregarding,* and *agent-neutral.* From the perspective of sympathetic concern, the cared-for's own values are regulative only to the extent they are represented in his welfare. If, for example, the person for whom one cares is sufficiently depressed, he may not value his own welfare or what would further it very much at all. In feeling sympathetic concern for him, one is regulated not by what he values or prefers (as in respect), but by what (one believes) would really benefit him. Of course, a person's welfare is bound up with his preferences and values, but the latter generate reasons of care only to the extent that this is so. And to one who cares, considerations of welfare present themselves as agent-neutral, rather than agentrelative, reasons. It seems a good thing agent-neutrally that the cared-for

<sup>13</sup> See the discussion of this point in Chapters 1, 2, and 4. As I note there, the reason may itself be agent-neutral even though it is grounded in something fundamentally second-personal and agent-relative. Thus the principle of utility, which takes an agent-neutral form, might be thought to be based in the more fundamental idea that we must act toward one another (and ourselves) in ways that reflect our equal authority to make claims of one another.

benefit and, therefore, that there is a reason for anyone who can to bring that state about and not just a reason for those who have some particular relation to the cared-for or happen to care for her.14 Finally, respect of one's dignity is something anyone can demand; but this is not so with sympathetic concern for oneself and one's welfare.

These differences between benevolent concern and respect can be brought out by reflecting on the relations between parents and children. Parents may legitimately give relatively little intrinsic weight to a sufficiently young child's protest against eating a healthful food, although they should take account of its bearing on the child's welfare, for example, the likelihood that eating it will be an unpleasant experience, the long-term effects on the child's psychic well-being of insisting that she eat it, and so on. At this stage, the parents may properly be guided by the child's welfare alone. When, however, their daughter returns to her former home in middle age, to take an extreme case, the situation is much changed. For parents not to take a middle-aged daughter's will as having intrinsic weight, indeed, as governing, would clearly be disrespectful, paternalism in the pejorative sense.15 Now she has a second-personal standing she simply did not have near the beginning of her life. And were her parents to attempt to pressure her to eat "her broccoli" at this point, they would rightly be subject to reproach. Their failure of respect would invite a second-personal response calling for respect, second-personally, from them to her.16

Or think again of being in pain because someone is stepping on your foot. To someone who cares for you, it will seem as if relief of your pain would be a good state of the world and as if, therefore, there is a reason for anyone who can to try to realize it. Of course, since the person who is stepping on your foot likely has the best position in the causal network to do this, this will seem to be a particularly good reason for him to

<sup>14</sup> For a further defense of these claims, see Darwall 2002b: 49, 69–72.

<sup>15</sup> For a very insightful account of paternalism that is especially illuminating in this connection, see Shiffrin 2000.

<sup>16</sup> We should note, however, that relations that we frequently call forms of care, like those between friends and loved ones, frequently involve respect as well as benevolent concern and have an ineliminable second-personal aspect. Friends, for example, understand themselves as supporting one another, including in their pursuit of their preferences, somewhat independently of considerations of each other's welfare. I am indebted here to Joseph Raz and Susan Wolf.

move his foot. But it will nonetheless be an agent-neutral reason. Your foot-treader's relation to you is just part of the causal structure that makes the agent-neutral normative fact that your being free of pain is desirable distinctively relevant to his deliberative situation. If, however, you see his taking his foot off yours to be dictated by mutual respect, you will see him as having a reason that is grounded in your authority to demand that he move his foot (indeed, to demand that he not have stepped on yours in the first place). This reason will be second-personal and agentrelative.17 You will see his relation to you (his gratuitously causing you pain) as intrinsically relevant to how he should conduct himself toward you. Moreover, as I argue in Chapters 10 and 11, the relevance of this agent-relative relation (in the logical sense) can be seen to flow from what it is to relate to one another in the second-personal sense. It is second-personal relating that is primary. Agent-relative norms, like "one should not cause gratuitous pain to others," can be explicated within a contractualist framework that is grounded in what we are committed to in relating to one another second-personally at all.

Respect concerns how we are to conduct ourselves in relating to others, whereas care is sensitive to how things go for others, whether that involves relating to them or not. In itself, care neither is defined by nor necessarily involves any distinctive conduct toward or relating to its object. Insofar as we care for someone, our interest in our own conduct toward him is instrumental. Benevolent concern leads us to want to act in whichever ways are most conducive to his welfare. Recognition respect for someone, however, involves distinctive ways of conducting oneself toward or relating to him as a person, namely, those that are mandated by his dignity.

Given all this, it is entirely expectable that philosophical conceptions of morality as rooted in universal benevolence should take agent-neutral consequentialist forms and that conceptions like morality as equal accountability should spawn deontological moral theories with agentrelative constraints.18 If morality is grounded in care or concern, then it

<sup>17</sup> Again, what makes this norm agent-relative is that it cannot be stated without making ineliminable reference to the agent. Many moral norms, those sometimes called "deontological constraints," are agent-relative in this sense: for example, a person should keep her promises, other things being equal. On this point, see McNaughton and Rawling 1993.

<sup>18</sup> Utilitarian theories from Hutcheson to Sidgwick are illustrations of the former, and Scanlon's contractualism nicely illustrates the latter. For excellent discussions of the relation between deontology and agent-relativity, see McNaughton and Rawling 1993 and 1995.

has a final agent-neutral aim, the welfare of all human or sentient beings, and moral evaluation of actions and social practices is therefore ultimately instrumental. Of course, it is possible to hold such a conception and maintain, as Mill did (1998: ch. 5), that the evaluation of conduct as wrong is not itself instrumental but dependent on accountabilitystructuring norms that are justified instrumentally themselves. But such evaluations are still instrumental at one remove; they treat private attitudes and public practices of responsibility as instruments for public good. And since they derive from a more fundamental agent-neutral aim, their normativity must ultimately be agent-neutral.

This last is, in effect, Strawson's Point about consequentialist approaches to moral responsibility extended to moral obligation. Conduciveness to an external goal differs from standards we are committed to within the second-person standpoint we take up when we address moral demands. By contrast, moral conceptions rooted in equal respect understand morality to concern most fundamentally how we should relate to one another—what demands we have standing to address and what standing we have to address them. This makes morality fundamentally a second-personal matter and, as a consequence, moral norms must be grounded from within the agent-relative/self-other standpoint of mutual respect. It is of course consistent with this framework (without further argument) that what we can demand from one another might include equal consideration of our welfare and, therefore, that respect for one another requires complying with, say, the agent-neutral principle of utility. This would be something like the reverse of Mill's position—getting an agent-neutral moral norm out of a fundamentally agent-relative conception of morality.19 And the parallel point would seem to apply, namely, that according to such a conception, the normativity of such an agent-neutral norm would itself be fundamentally agent-relative (albeit, at one remove).

### **Kant on Respect**

We shall consider respect's second-personal character in more detail presently. This can easily be missed. I missed it, for example, in my 1977

<sup>19</sup> I have been helped here by discussion with Allan Gibbard.

article, when I identified recognition respect for persons with "tak[ing] seriously and weigh[ing] appropriately the fact that they are persons in deliberating about what to do" (38).20 This makes respect something one can realize outside of a second-personal relation; one need only adequately register a fact about or feature of someone: that she is a person.21 In a similar vein, Iris Murdoch complains against Kant's view that Kant makes the object of respect not individual persons but "universal reason in their breasts" (Murdoch 1999: 215).22 In this section, we consider Kant's views on respect. These have great interest in their own right, and they include a number of important points on which we continue to draw throughout the rest of the book. In what remains of this chapter, I argue that the key to seeing how recognition respect for persons actually is an attitude toward individuals, and not just toward a fact about or a quality in them, is to appreciate respect's role in mediating second-personal relations (that is, relatings) between individuals. And I suggest that the seeds of this view are in what Kant himself says about respect.

Respect *(Achtung)* figures in three distinct places in Kant's ethical writings.23 First, in section 1 of the *Groundwork,* Kant argues that "respect for law" characterizes morally worthy conduct and that "duty is the necessity of an action from respect for law" (1996b: 400). Second, in the *Critique of Practical Reason,* Kant provides an empirical psychology of moral action and, within it, an account of the psychology of respect (1996a: 71–89). Third, in *The Metaphysics of Morals,* Kant discusses duties of respect, both to oneself and to others (1996d: 434–437, 462–468).

Kant does not explicitly distinguish between appraisal and recognition respect. Most of the time he is concerned with recognition respect for persons and their distinctive dignity, but there are places where what he has in mind is fairly clearly a form of appraisal respect, namely, compar-

<sup>20</sup> In Hill 1998, Thomas E. Hill Jr. takes a similar view, writing that recognition respect for person is a "disposition to give appropriate weight in one's deliberations to the fact that someone is a person (whether meritorious or not)."

<sup>21</sup> For a similar point, see Buss 1999a: 797.

<sup>22</sup> I am indebted for this reference to Carla Bagnoli. See Bagnoli 2003.

<sup>23</sup> I am very much indebted in this section to Peter Vranas's analysis of Kant on respect in Vranas 2001: 25–39. I follow Vranas in many aspects of his analysis, but not all (for example, his tendency to identify *reverentia* with a form of appraisal respect). I have been helped also by Dillon 2004 and Bernard Reginster's "The Moral Distinction of Self-Conceit," presented at the Kantian Ethics Conference, University of San Diego, January 16–18, 2003.

ative moral esteem: "before a humble common man in whom I perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am aware of in myself *my spirit bows.*"24 Just after this, Kant adds that "*respect* is a *tribute* that we cannot refuse to pay to merit" (1996a: 77). In our terms, respect that responds to merit and "uprightness of character" is appraisal respect.

Why Kant should be concerned to mark off instances of appraisal respect where another appears to have greater merit is somewhat unclear. Kant believes that the experience of respect invariably involves feelings of humiliation, as we shall see, and he may be thinking that this element would be lost unless we saw the other as having greater merit.25 However, as we shall also see, Kant believes that recognition respect of the dignity of persons always involves a humbling acknowledgment of the moral law, which, according to his analysis, unavoidably "strikes down self-conceit" (1996a: 73). He repeats that analysis here, saying that the common person's example "holds before me a law that strikes down my self conceit" (77). But this will be true whether or not one sees the other as adhering more closely to this law.

The only distinction Kant explicitly draws within respect is that between *reverentia,* by which he invariably means a feeling of respect, and *observantia* or "respect in the practical sense," which he identifies with "the *maxim* of limiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in another person" (1996d: 402, 449). Obviously, *reverentia* is what is involved in the comparative appraisal respect just discussed. But it is important to Kant's empirical moral psychology that recognition respect for the moral law and the dignity of persons *(observantia)* also gives rise to *reverentia.* Thus, in discussing the duty of self-respect, Kant remarks that a person has a worth that is "above any price, . . . an inalienable dignity *(dignitas interna)* which instills in him respect for himself *(reverentia)*" (436).

There is no duty directly to feel *reverentia* (1996d: 402). We can't have a duty to experience a feeling, Kant thinks. Rather, we have a duty of *observantia* to respect the dignity of humanity within ourselves and others,

<sup>24</sup> See note 4 for some evidence that Kant sometimes runs together dignity as an object of recognition respect and dignity as an object of appraisal respect (moral esteem).

<sup>25</sup> Kant doesn't say that we must believe or judge that the other has greater merit, rather, that in experiencing respect of this sort for another person, we see, feel, or experience the other as better than us. I know my own imperfections at first hand, but the other "appears to me in a purer light" (1996a: 77).

and the phenomenal experience or feeling of doing so is *reverentia.* Similarly, when Kant says that feelings of love and respect "accompany the carrying out" of the duties of love and respect, respectively, he is distinguishing simultaneously between pathological and practical forms of love and respect (448). Pathological love is what we feel when we carry out the duties of (practical) benevolence, and *reverentia* is what we feel when we carry out the duties of *observantia* or "respect in the practical sense" (448–468).

This brings us to Kant's explanation of how *observantia* gives rise to *reverentia,* how, that is, practical respect for the moral law and the dignity of persons involves distinctive feelings of respect. The framework for Kant's speculative psychology of respect is his transcendental idealism and "two standpoints" doctrine—Kant's distinction between the point of view we take on ourselves and our actions when we experience them as part of the causal structure of the "phenomenal" world of sense experience, on the one hand, and the intelligible perspective we adopt when deliberating about what to do, on the other (see 1996b: 451–462). From the deliberative standpoint (and, importantly, from the second-person perspective involved in holding one another accountable), our concern is not primarily to figure out what will happen or has happened. We are concerned, rather, with what we should do, with what we or someone else should have done, and with how appropriately to hold people accountable in light of what they actually did. From these perspectives, the phenomenal feeling of respect in us, *reverentia,* is not on the radar screen.

In deliberating about what to do, for example, we don't usually consider how, as a matter of psychology, we actually will, or will be able to, act on the reasons we come ultimately to accept.26 Nor, in the course of deliberation, do we ordinarily contemplate how we feel in deliberating or acting. To deliberate intelligibly at all we must simply presuppose that we can act on good and conclusive reasons as we will come to see them.27 Similarly, in holding someone accountable, we must proceed on the assumption that, without defeating evidence to the contrary, he could have acted as he was obligated. In addition to these practical needs, however, we also have the theoretical need to understand ourselves, one another,

<sup>27</sup> Of course, one may know of certain practical deficiencies and sensibly deliberate in light of these. But these must be relatively local and regulated by the global presupposition that one can act on what one takes to be good and sufficient reasons.

<sup>26</sup> Korsgaard 1996c is especially helpful here.

and our actions as part of the causal structure of the world we experience. This is where *reverentia,* the feeling a person has when she acts on the moral law and respects the dignity of persons in the "practical sense," enters the picture.

According to Kant, *reverentia* is a feeling that operates as a cause within our phenomenal psychology. Kant thinks that we can know *a priori* that we are subject to the feeling of respect, indeed, that any finite rational being must be. Assuming, as Kant believes, that recognition of the moral law is a condition of the possibility of pure practical reason, then so also is it a presupposition of the possibility of practical respect. This is the "fact of reason" (1996a: 30–31). In taking ourselves to be bound by the moral law, we perforce assume that we can comply with it. But morally obligatory action can be realized in the phenomenal realm only if its phenomenal counterpart has a phenomenal cause, and Kant takes it that this must be a feeling. So any finite rational being subject to moral imperatives must also be characterized by a psychology having something whose role, as the phenomenal counterpart of practical respect, is to cause the phenomenal counterpart of moral action. *Reverentia* is the feeling that plays this role.

We, however, are interested less in respect's functional role than in what Kant says about its distinctive phenomenology. Respect for the moral law, Kant says, "thwart[s]" and "restricts" *self-love,* but, more importantly, "humiliates" and "strikes down *self-conceit*" (1996a: 73). By "self-love," Kant refers to a "natural" "propensity" to take merely "subjective determining grounds" of the will to have objective normative significance. Like a naïve experiencer who takes an apparently bent stick in water to be really bent, a naïve agent may take his desire's object to be a source of reasons, oblivious to peculiarities of the perspective that his desire gives him. Things that are important to him seem to be important period. Self-love in this sense poses no deep threat to morality, however; in principle, it need be no more dangerous than the innocent mistakes of perspective that can be corrected once we are able to draw a subjective/objective distinction within our experience and accept some as mere appearances. Self-love, Kant thinks, needs only to be curbed by the moral law.

Self-conceit, however, assaults the moral law directly, and so it must be "humiliated." It is a form of arrogance *(arrogantia):* the presumption that one has a kind of worth or dignity oneself, independently of the moral law, through which self-love is made "lawgiving and the unconditional practical principle" (1996a: 73, 74). This is not just a naïve tendency to mistake seeming normative relevance from one's perspective with objective normative weight. It is rather the radical idea that something has objective normative significance because it is what one wills subjectively—first, that one has a unique standing to create reasons for acting independently of and unconstrained by the moral law, but also, second, that one can address these reasons to others and expect compliance, in other words, that one has a unique authority to address second-personal reasons: "lack of modesty in one's claims to be respected by others is *self-conceit (arrogantia)*" (1996d: 462).28

A person with "self-love" confuses what she desires with the objectively desirable. In desiring that her thirst be relieved, she takes it that there are reasons, in principle for anyone, to desire this state and bring it about. But she doesn't think that others should do this because this is what she wants or wills. Rather, in wanting it, it just seems to her that such reasons exist. Self-conceit, in contrast, is the idea that one's own will is a source of normative reasons (and is so uniquely). A thirsty person with selfconceit will take it that others have reasons to relieve his thirst because this is what he wills or wants (though he would have no such reasons if roles were reversed).

*Self-conceit is thus a fantasy about second-personal status.*29 It is the conceit that one has a normative standing that others don't have to dictate reasons just because of who or what one is.30 The idea is not that one has the kind of authority that an especially good advisor does, that one

<sup>28</sup> Cf. Karen Horney's discussion of neurotic egocentricity: "a *wish* or *need,* in itself quite understandable, turns into a claim. Its nonfulfillment is felt as an unfair frustration, as an offense about which we have a right to feel indignant" (1970: 42; quoted in Swanton 2003: 190).

<sup>29</sup> Compare here what Dillon says about the relation between self-conceit and "interpersonal respect" (2004). Dillon distinguishes another form of arrogance, "primary arrogance," that concerns not primarily interpersonal disrespect but an arrogation to oneself of rights one doesn't have. If, however, as I believe, the notion of a right itself involves the irreducibly second-personal authority to lay a claim or make a demand, then primary arrogance may itself be ultimately an interpersonal or second-personal notion also.

<sup>30</sup> Cf. Bob Dylan's "Disease of Conceit" (2004: 534–535): "Whole lot of people seeing double tonight / From the disease of conceit / Give ya delusions of grandeur / And a evil eye / Give you the idea that / You're too good to die / Then they bury you from your head to your feet / From the disease of conceit."

sees better than others reasons that are there anyway. (Although it might involve this thought, if one took it to justify a special second-personal status.) It is rather the fantasy that one has a fundamental "lawgiving" standing that others simply don't have—as if one were king or God.31 This is far from an innocent illusion, although Kant follows Rousseau in thinking that it is depressingly expectable whenever social comparison engenders *amour propre.*32

It follows that the moral law cannot simply curtail self-conceit or keep it in its place; it must "strike it down." It must declare "null and quite unwarranted" any "claims to esteem for oneself that precede accord with the moral law" (1996a: 73). We shouldn't be thrown off by Kant's use of 'esteem' here. The moral law must supplant self-conceit's presumptuous second-personal authority, the standing it presumes to demand recognition of the claims and demands it purports to address. Kant uses 'esteem' in a similar way when he defines *observantia* or "respect in the practical sense" as "the *maxim* of limiting our self-esteem by the dignity of humanity in another person" (1996d: 449). Obviously, in this context, 'esteem' must refer to recognition rather than to appraisal respect. Selfconceit is the fantasy that one has a claim to others' recognition respect but that they reciprocally do not have any against one.

The moral law substitutes the equal dignity of persons—the mutual accountability of the kingdom of ends—for the fantasized despotism of self-conceit.33 The respect-creating encounter with a "humble common" person gives rise to a response to the common dignity that all persons share. This is no esteem (appraisal respect) that persons might differentially deserve,34 but a form of respect that any individual can demand

<sup>31</sup> "Arrogance (*superbia* and, as this word expresses it, the inclination to be always *on top*) is a kind of *ambition (ambitio)* in which we demand that others think little of themselves in comparison with us" (Kant 1996d: 465). For a fascinating discussion of the role of the "wish to be God" in Kant's philosophy generally, see Neiman 2002: 57–84.

<sup>32</sup> For an insightful account of Kant's ethics that stresses the role of self-conceit, see Wood 1999.

<sup>33</sup> I believe this also provides a useful framework within which to think of other selfserving ideologies, such as those of race and gender.

<sup>34</sup> Although even this is an important idea, as Mill appreciated: "The principle of the modern movement in morals and politics, is that conduct, and conduct alone, entitles to respect: that not what men are, but what they do, constitutes their claim to deference; that, above all, merit, and not birth, is the only rightful claim to power and authority" (1988: 88).

simply by virtue of being a person (1996d: 434–35). And we recognize each other's equal authority to make demands as a free and rational agent by acknowledging our mutual accountability (for example, through reactive attitudes) and holding ourselves responsible to one another for complying with these. Respect for others thus involves making oneself accountable to others as equal persons, rather than simply taking account of any fact, norm, or value about one another as persons in our own private deliberations.

Kant divides "duties to others merely as human beings" into duties of love and duties of respect. Performance of duties of love is "meritorious" and therefore "puts others under obligation." Discharging duties of respect, however, gives rise to no reciprocating obligations since here we only do for others what is already "owed" them in the first place (1996d: 448). "No one is wronged if duties of love are neglected; but a failure in the duty of respect infringes upon one's lawful claim" (464). Indeed, "Every human being has a legitimate claim to respect from his fellow human beings and is *in turn* bound to respect every other" (462). Thus, "recognition [*Anerkennung*] of a *dignity (dignitas)* in other human beings, that is, of a worth that has no price," is something others can "require from me" (462).35

It follows that the duty of respect includes any specific duty, compliance with which persons have the authority to demand. Respecting others as equal persons requires that we discharge these duties. But it requires also that we recognize others' "legitimate claim" to our doing so, and this we can do only by recognizing their authority to claim or demand it. This is what brings in accountability and the second-person stance. In holding that the dignity of persons is that by which we can "demand," "exact," or "require" respect from others, that each thereby has a "legitimate claim" to respect, Kant is committed to the idea that the dignity of persons includes a second-personal authority to address demands for compliance with the first-order duties of respect. To respect that authority it is insufficient simply to comply with the first-order duties, even for the reason that duty requires it.36 The standing to address demands can only be recognized second-personally, by making ourselves accountable to one another as equal free and rational agents for complying with the relevant

<sup>35</sup> Note Kant's use of 'Anerkennung' here. As we see in Chapter 10, this is the term that looms so large in Fichte's discussion.

<sup>36</sup> Unless the latter is given a second-personal reading.

first-order requirements. As Feinberg (1980) says, it is "the activity of claiming" that makes for self-respect and the equal dignity of persons. The kingdom of ends is a community of mutually accountable persons (Korsgaard 1996a).

### **Self-Conceit and Morality: The Case of Stalin**

In Chapter 10, I argue that the fantasy of self-conceit is ultimately selfundermining since second-personal address commits us, quite generally, to an authority that anyone has just by virtue of second-personal competence. Briefly: addressing second-personal reasons always presupposes not just the addresser's authority and competence to hold the addressee responsible for compliance, but also the addressee's authority and competence to hold himself responsible. It is committed, therefore, to the authority of a perspective that addresser and addressee can occupy in common: the second-person standpoint of mutually accountable persons. Even when someone addresses reasons he takes to derive from an unreciprocated authority over his addressee, he can blame his addressee for not complying only from the very same standpoint from which his addressee can blame himself, a standpoint they share in common as free and rational persons. As Strawson noted, therefore, reactive attitudes involve a form of respect for their objects as persons with the very same authority to hold themselves and others responsible as well (Strawson 1968: 93).

A natural response to this argument may be to agree that if the presupposition that addressees can freely acknowledge and make authoritative demands of themselves from such a common standpoint is part of the very idea of second-personal address, then perhaps it does commit us to the equal dignity of free and rational persons, but then to deny that second-personal address, so understood, is anything we need have much of a stake in. Surely people can presume authority without having to think anything about whether those over whom they think they have it can be expected freely to accept it and comply on that basis. Alternatively, it seems that someone might be content with simply having power over others without any kind of authorizing narrative at all.

I agree that even Kantian self-conceit, the idea that one has an authority that no one else has, is coherent as an abstract proposition, and nothing I argue will assume otherwise. What I do argue is that taking up a secondperson standpoint toward others and addressing second-personal reasons to them commits us to mutual accountability and, therefore, to denying self-conceit (however intelligible that proposition might otherwise be). I do not claim or assume that it is impossible to have or want power over others irrespective of any authority requiring second-personal reasons would that it were so! Nevertheless, it is worth pointing out that neither self-conceit, at least in a pure form that excludes an underlying moralizing rationalization, nor the desire for power pure and simple, exclusive of an authorizing rationale, is at all common among human beings as we find them.

Consider Stalin, for example. Stalin would seem to have been as hungry for power or as liable to self-conceit as they come, but at least in Edvard Radzinsky's riveting biography (1997), he also appears to have been someone who was motivated by richly elaborated reactive attitudes, which, to be sure, he marshaled for his own ends. As Radzinsky describes him, Stalin's self-conceit was not pure. His emotional life was replete with episodes, frequently staged, in which a justified authority over others seemed manifest to him, justified in ways that, as it seemed to him, others should be able to appreciate. And even his cruelest murders were accompanied, indeed fueled, by self-justifying emotions and narratives. It seems no exaggeration to say, in fact, that Stalin's distinctive form of evil essentially employed a cynical and distorted form of moral self-justification that he manipulated for his own purposes. Thus, Radzinsky tells us, a standard ploy of Stalin's was to catch someone he wished to "eliminate" in a lie, after which Stalin "felt entitled to feel a moral hatred for the liar and traitor" (237). Radzinsky describes a poignant scene from Stalin's boyhood in which, when fellow students in the Gori Church School "made a back" to enable an elderly teacher to cross a wide and turbulent stream, Stalin was overheard to say: " 'What are youthen, a donkey? I wouldn't make a back for the Lord God himself.' " To which Radzinsky adds, "He was morbidly proud, like many people who have been humiliated too often" (29).

I, for one, find it impossible to read Radzinsky's accounts of Stalin's fury-fueled, but coldly calculated, in-fighting, purges, murders, and willing sacrifice of his own innocent citizens without seeing in it a form of *ressentiment* that takes itself to be seizing and wielding power, not nakedly, but righteously. In my view, this sort of distorted self-serving moralizing is actually quite common, although not, thankfully, on Stalin's scale. People frequently manipulate aspects of the moral framework in narratives that rationalize their special exemptions and departures. It is actually quite rare, I think, for human beings to reject the second-person standpoint outright, since, for one thing, our emotional lives are full of reactive feelings and attitudes that essentially involve it. Although "hypocrite" is perhaps not the first epithet one would use, even Stalin seems to instantiate Rochefoucauld's dictum that "hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue" (Rochefoucauld 1973: 79).

### **Respect as Second-Personal**

We are now in a position to see that respect for persons is second-personal in two distinct, but related, senses: it involves recognition of a second-personal authority and the recognition itself comes from a second-person standpoint. Consider the former aspect first. Someone might accept the first-order norms that structure the dignity of persons and regulate himself scrupulously by them without yet accepting anyone's authority to demand that he do so. He might even accept these as mandatory norms without accepting any claim to his compliance. I hope it is now clear that although such a person would thereby respect the duties with which persons can demand compliance, in failing to respect their authority to demand this, he would also fail, in an important sense, to respect them. He would fail to acknowledge their equal authority as free and rational and so fail to relate to them on terms of equal respect.

In *The Realm of Rights,* Judith Thomson says that respect for persons can have no foundational role in morality if "respect for persons just is respect for their rights" (1990: 210–211).37 But is respect for someone simply respect for her rights? If we think of respecting someone's rights as according her the specific things that Thomson maintains we have a right to—forbearing trespass, coercion, and causing undue harm and distress; keeping promises; and so on, then respect for her as a person cannot consist just in that. For we could respect persons' rights in this sense without respecting these as their right, as anything they have the authority to claim or demand from us.

This is the first way in which respect is second-personal: a fundamentally second-personal authority. But this form of authority is itself some-

<sup>37</sup> I am grateful to Judith Thomson for discussion of these points.

thing that is appropriately recognized second-personally also, through relating to others in a way that acknowledges this authority. And this is the second way in which respect is second-personal. Not only is the authority it recognizes second-personal, but its distinctive form of recognition is second-personal also. We accord authority within the second-personal relations that structure mutual accountability by relating to one another in ways that acknowledge each other's standing to demand, remonstrate, resist, charge, blame, resent, feel indignant, excuse, forgive, and so on. Since accountability is, in its nature, second-personal in both senses, respect for persons is as well.

It seems possible to respect the fact that someone has second-personal authority—for example, that she can claim certain conduct as her right without relating to her in the way that genuine respect for her as a person involves.38 To see this, consider, first, an analogous case in theoretical reasoning. Suppose you are disinclined to trust someone's judgment in forming your own beliefs, but that, on reflection, you reject your distrust and think youshould take his testimony as evidence. When he says, "*p,*" this does not increase your inclination to believe *p* or to give his testimony evidential weight until you recall your considered view about his reliability, which corrects your distrust. Here it seems natural to say that although you respect the fact that he is a reliable witness and so the fact that he has a claim on your beliefs, you do not, yet anyway, fully trust and respect him and his judgment.

Consider now a fully second-personal case. Suppose it is a parent who is not yet disposed to regard his college-age daughter as a fully independent person with full second-personal authority, at least, not to do so wholeheartedly. We can well imagine that he believes, on reflection, that he should so regard her, that is, that she has the same claim to respect that he does. But parental habits die hard. When she says she doesn't want to do something within her discretion that he believes to be for her greater good, he is disinclined to defer to her in his own reasoning about what to do and feel with respect to her until he reminds himself of his considered conviction. When she calls him on his paternalism, he is neither naturally nor second-naturally disposed to see and hold himself responsible as from her authoritative perspective (for example, by feeling guilt or shame) but defends himself until he recalls that she is right; she

<sup>38</sup> In what follows, I am indebted to Amanda Roth.

really is no less entitled to respect than he is. Here again, it seems that although the parent respects the fact that his daughter has the same dignity he does, he does not yet relate to her on terms of equal respect; he does not yet accord her full second-personal authority in relating to her.39 Respect of this kind is an irreducibly second-personal way of relating to someone *de re.* It is the relation to individual persons that is primary. Indeed, the fact that someone has second-personal authority just *is* her having the standing to claim to be related to in this way.

To respect someone as a person is not just to regulate one's conduct by the fact that one is accountable to him, or even just to acknowledge the truth of this fact to him; it is also to make oneself or be accountable to him, and this is impossible outside of a second-personal relation. This, I believe, is what most deeply underlies the sense of 'respect''s root, '*respiceˇre*' (to look back). To return someone's address and look back at him is to establish second-personal relationship and acknowledge the other's second-personal authority. To look someone in the eye is to make oneself and one's eyes, the "windows" of one's soul, vulnerable to him, and in both directions. One gives the other a window on one's responses to him but also makes oneself vulnerable to his attitudes and responses by empathy.40 When the address is an attempt to hold one responsible, returning the other's address, being open to his claims, including by giving him this window, is itself part of holding oneself accountable to him.41

<sup>39</sup> Cf. Sarah Buss on "respect in its primitive, prereflective mode" (Buss 1999b: 539).

<sup>40</sup> At the most primitive level, by mimicry and contagion, but also by imaginative projection, since one must already be doing that in relating to him second-personally, as we saw in Chapter 3.

<sup>41</sup> When I gave an earlier version of this chapter as a Presidential Address to the Central Division of the American Philosophical Association in April 2004, I preceded it with a video clip from *The Blues Brothers* in which the character played by Aretha Franklin attempts to hold Matt "Guitar" Murphy accountable with a rendition of "Think (You'd Better Think What You're Doin' to Me)," much of which she sings in a wonderful eyeto-eye dance with Matt. The conceit was that the view of respect expressed in my (1977) article was like that of Aretha Franklin's famous "Respect" and that the view expressed in the address (and this book) was (is) like that of her *Blues Brothers*' "Think." The earlier was a first-personal, giving someone "her propers" view; the second took respect for persons to be essentially second-personal.

Bernardo Strozzi's painting, *The Tribute Money*, illustrates the same point. As Matthew tells the story (in the King James version of the Bible), the Pharisees attempt to entrap Jesus and ask him whether or not it is lawful to give tribute to Caesar. "But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?" (Matthew 22:18). I imagine this to be the moment that Strozzi's painting depicts. Jesus is addressing the Pharisees and

### **Manners,Honor,and Public Space**

We respect someone as a person when we acknowledge her dignity. Of course, this acknowledgment need not always be explicit. Part of what we claim from one another is a space of personal privacy or discretion within which we can be left more or less alone if we want. If respect for persons always called for explicit acknowledgment, it would be impossible for this claim ever to be realized. Moreover, in a social situation in which the demands of personal dignity are sufficiently well established and generally reciprocally recognized, explicit acknowledgment is less commonly called for. But think of situations in which the dignity of persons, say of some group in particular, is under attack, not just in the sense that they are subjected to various forms of injury, but also in the sense that that their claim to dignity, their second-personal status as persons, is threatened or not generally recognized. To maintain, in such a situation, that one respects the dignity of members of this group without being willing to acknowledge it publicly will be difficult.

Another aspect of the shared public space in which respect figures centrally is etiquette. Sarah Buss argues that expressing respect is "the essential function of good manners" (1999a: 795).42 Her point is not simply that respect frequently calls for politeness. This we learn at our parents' knees. It is rather that conventions of etiquette are at least partly public rituals of respect in something like the way that religious rituals enact the idea of the sacred. By treating one another cordially and courteously, we give an "outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual" *reverentia* for the dignity of persons that is itself second-personal.

Of course, etiquette can, and perhaps frequently does, also reinforce

attempting to hold them accountable. But look closely at the Pharisee on the right—he is not looking back at Jesus, but past him to another Pharisee on the other side. I like to think that this shows that Strozzi appreciates Pufendorf 's Point: even God must gain our recognition to hold us accountable. I am grateful to Will Darwall for noticing this and to both Julian and Will Darwall for helpful conversation on this point.

<sup>42</sup> Sarah Buss (1999b) quotes a remarkable passage from Hume in which Hume says that the function of manners is to check self-conceit: "As the mutual shocks, in *society,* and the oppositions of interest and self-love have constrained mankind to establish the laws of *justice;* in order to preserve the advantages of mutual assistance and protection: In like manner, the eternal contrarieties, in *company,* of men's pride and self-conceit, have introduced the rules of good-manners or politeness; in order to facilitate the intercourse of minds, and an undisturbed commerce and conversation" (Hume 1985a: 261). See also Sherman, unpublished.

divisions and hierarchies that are in conflict with equal respect. Even calls for "common courtesy" and "decency" can blunt and subvert challenges to an established unjust order that are necessary genuinely to respect others as equals.43 Nonetheless, properly conceived, manners are an important supplement to a morality of equal respect.

It is useful to compare the way respect for one another as persons is mediated in a mutually accountable public space with the way a superficially similar, but fundamentally different, kind of recognition respect and disrespect are enacted in a culture of honor. Insults are paradigmatic expressions of disrespect of this latter kind. But although insults are invariably addressed,44 when they assault someone's honor, the standing they threaten differs from second-personal authority, since, unlike the dignity of persons, it is socially constituted.45 In traditional honor societies, insults like Bolingbroke's "pale trembling coward" address to Mowbray in Shakespeare's *Richard II* put in question the ability to receive the honor of others' favorable regard and acceptance as someone of merit. Honor may present itself as merited, but it is nonetheless "bestowed on people by society," as Avishai Margalit puts it (1996: 24). Whether Bolingbroke's insults and charges are groundless or not, Mowbray is right to believe that he will nonetheless be dishonored unless he can successfully defend his good name in a way that convinces people to restore their faith and credit in him.

Sufficiently wide disrespect destroys honor by constituting dishonor. But not even universal disrespect can destroy the dignity of free and rational persons, at least, not directly. Equal dignity is nothing anyone can bestow, so neither is it anything any person or group can remove through disrespect. Humiliations that aim to degrade, depersonalize, and dehumanize must work differently. They must seek not simply to lower someone's standing in others' eyes, but to demean someone in his own

<sup>43</sup> William Chafe (1980) gives many compelling illustrations of how "civility" was appealed to by white North Carolinians in resisting attempts to desegregate schools long after the Supreme Court held segregation to be unconstitutional in *Brown v. Board of Education.*

<sup>44</sup> One can feel insulted and be offended without being addressed, even indirectly, in an insulting way. And it is possible also for someone to express things that are genuinely insulting to one without addressing one, even indirectly. It is not, however, possible to insult someone without addressing her, at least indirectly.

<sup>45</sup> And it is also, I would further argue, not fundamentally about accountability at all.

eyes so that he loses self-respect. Even this doesn't directly destroy the dignity to which respect for persons and self-respect responds. Still, we know that it is possible for domination by violence and threats of violence, and even by relatively nonviolent, disrespecting relations or institutions that are, in Goffman's term, sufficiently "total," to beat down, dispirit, and undermine self-confidence and self-respect so that the very second-personal capacities necessary for accountable living can atrophy (Goffman 1961).

There are important differences between the ways in which attitudes of respect and disrespect support and reinforce a regime of honor and the manner in which reactive attitudes function in a second-personal economy of mutual respect. Disrespect (contempt) that dishonors is disdain—an attitude that is addressed not so much to its object as to those with the standing to bestow honor or dishonor upon that person. Disdain does not demand, nor even really invite, response from its object; it is exclusive rather than inclusive. And what a person loses when he is dishonored is not a standing within a mutually accountable community, but "face," a social place (where one can show one's face without having to justify oneself to others).46

Reactive attitudes through which we hold one another accountable, however, have an inclusiveness that follows from their second-personal character. Blame, indignation, resentment, remonstrance, and so on, are, as it were, reciprocally addressed to their objects. In calling for acknowledgment, they have an implicit mutuality or reciprocity. As Strawson says, "the partial withdrawal of goodwill which *these* attitudes entail... is, rather, the consequence of *continuing* to view [their object] as a member of the moral community" (1968: 93). Reactive attitudes engage their targets second-personally and aim to draw them into an exchange that will constitute their being held accountable.47 Their address comes with an implicit RSVP.

<sup>46</sup> Relevant here is the deep connection I noted before (Chapter 3, note 31) between honesty and the search for truth, on the one hand, and public accountability, on the other. By reckoning people at "face value," cultures of honor actually pose an obstacle both to public inquiry and to public accountability and encourage evasion and keeping up appearances. A request for justification is itself an insult in such a social framework.

<sup>47</sup> This, I believe, provides a basis for responding to Annette Baier's (1993) criticisms of the Kantian approach.

### **Whence Dignity?**

Morality as equal accountability thus presupposes that every free and rational agent has a dignity for which he can demand respect. But what can support this idea? I argued in Chapters 3 and 4 that moral obligation is essentially tied to second-personal accountability. This was the thesis of *morality as accountability.* The very idea of moral obligation presupposes that of a second-personal authority or dignity, whether as in the early modern natural law conception of *morality as accountability to God* or as in the Kantian/contractualist conception of *morality as equal accountability.*

But what can support or vindicate any of these ideas? Much as Kant says of his argument at the end of section 2 of the *Groundwork,* our method to this point has been to analyze assumptions and presuppositions of moral obligation as these latter ideas are "generally accepted" (1996b: 445). As Kant points out, however, it is entirely consistent with these analytical results that the ideas of morality and moral obligation are nothing but a "figment of the mind" (2002: 445).48 And if that were so, so also would the ideas of second-personal authority that I have argued are conceptually or analytically contained within them be illusory as well.

To vindicate moral obligation and the dignity of persons and show that they are not mere figments, Kant says that a "critique" of practical reason is necessary (1996b: 445). In Chapter 9, we consider how Kant pursues such a critique in *Groundwork* 3 and in *The Critique of Practical Reason.* Ultimately, Kant abandons the strategy he broached in *Groundwork* 3 of trying first to secure the idea of freedom or autonomy in a critique of practical reason and then to show how the other central moral ideas can be derived from that. In the *Critique of Practical Reason,* Kant is content to treat acceptance of the moral law as a central undeniable aspect of our practical lives and to defend it from that perspective.49 Kant was right ultimately to reject his *Groundwork* approach, but as I argue further in Chapter 10, however, Kant was wrong to give up on the attempt to provide a more substantial vindication of morality than is possible with the defensive strategy he was later content to take.

We have already seen that the lesson of Strawson's Point is that an

<sup>48</sup> This is Allen Wood's translation of *Hirngespinst.*

<sup>49</sup> This is the method Rawls (2000) refers to as "philosophy as defense."

adequate theory of moral responsibility must invoke standards that are internal to the second-person standpoint. And I have argued that moral obligation's conceptual tie to accountability yields the further consequence that an adequate theory of moral obligation must also be available within the second-person point of view. But this line of argument has proceeded by analyzing "generally accepted" concepts of moral responsibility and obligation to reveal their irreducibly second-personal character, and so it is impotent by itself to vindicate the very ideas it analyzes. In Chapter 10, however, I proceed in the opposite direction and argue that the presuppositions of the second-person standpoint, when fully worked clear, include the dignity of persons and the moral law. For any kind of second-personal reason, based on a second-personal relation of whatever form, both addresser and addressee are committed by the terms of their relation to presupposing that they have a common normative standing simply by virtue of being (second-personally competent) rational persons. This vindicates moral obligation and the dignity of persons on the assumption that second-personal reasons exist at all.

But why suppose that any second-personal reasons are valid? Chapters 10 and 11 also develop Fichte's Point that second-personal interaction gives us an awareness of the distinctive character of our own agency and of a kind of freedom—autonomy—that distinguishes practical reasoning fundamentally from theoretical reason. In second-personal engagement, we see that we have a kind of freedom we simply could not have if reasoning about what to do were like reasoning about what to believe. And this helps us to locate second-personal reasons within an overall theory of practical reason.
