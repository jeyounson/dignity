### **[Moral Obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)'s Purported [Normativity](dictionary.md#normativity)**

The most familiar characterization of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s' purported [normative](dictionary.md#normative) force is in terms of their putatively *[categorical](dictionary.md#categorical)* character, their purporting to be what Kant (1996b) called "[categorical imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative)s." Philippa Foot (1972) points out that this cannot mean just that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are [categorical](dictionary.md#categorical) in [form](dictionary.md#form), that they "[apply](dictionary.md#apply)" independently of their relation to the [agent's](dictionary.md#agent) [ends](dictionary.md#end). Requirements of etiquette are unconditional in this way also, but nobody thinks that their [putative](dictionary.md#putative) [normative](dictionary.md#normative) force is anything like that of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) requirements. Foot concludes that the Kantian [claim](dictionary.md#claim) must rather be that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s "necessarily give [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) to any man" (309). Frequently this [claim](dictionary.md#claim) is strengthened to what Scheffler calls the "[thesis](dictionary.md#thesis) of overridingness": "it can never be [rational](dictionary.md#rational) knowingly to do what [morality](dictionary.md#morality) forbids" (1992).[^1] In other words, [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s always give [agents](dictionary.md#agent) [conclusive](dictionary.md#conclusive) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) that outweigh or take [priority](dictionary.md#priority) over any potentially competing [considerations](dictionary.md#consideration); or, at least, they always purport to do so.

This surely captures part of what is felt to be special about [moral](dictionary.md#moral) requirements, but only part. [Compare](dictionary.md#compare) logical requirements. If a [conclusion](dictionary.md#conclusion) [follows](dictionary.md#follow) from [known](dictionary.md#know) [premises](dictionary.md#premise), then we are under a requirement of [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to infer it that apparently applies to all [rational](dictionary.md#rational) beings also, [considerations](dictionary.md#consideration) to the [contrary](dictionary.md#contrary) notwithstanding. But there is an important difference between [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s and requirements that are imposed by logic. [Morality](dictionary.md#morality) involves a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) by its very [nature](dictionary.md#nature). If I fail to [act](dictionary.md#act) as I am morally required without adequate excuse, then distinctively [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) responses like [blame](dictionary.md#blame) and [guilt](dictionary.md#guilt) are thereby warranted.[^2] But it is only in [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [contexts](dictionary.md#context) that responses like these seem [appropriate](dictionary.md#appropriate) to logical blunders, and even here what seems to be in question is a [moral](dictionary.md#moral) error of some [kind](dictionary.md#kind) (as when I have a special [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) for [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) properly).[^3] Moreover, although a connection to [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) is part of the very [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation), it is obviously no part whatsoever of the idea of a logical requirement.[^4]

Mill famously remarked that "we do not call anything [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong), unless we mean to [imply](dictionary.md#imply) that a [person](dictionary.md#person) [ought](dictionary.md#ought) to be punished in some way or other for doing it; if not by [law](dictionary.md#law), by the opinion of his fellow [creatures](dictionary.md#creature); if not by opinion, by the [reproaches](dictionary.md#reproach) of his own [conscience](dictionary.md#conscience)." We may think there are strong [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [people](dictionary.md#people) to do something and "dislike or despise them for not doing" it; but unless we think "[blame](dictionary.md#blame)" or some other [form](dictionary.md#form) of "[punishment](dictionary.md#punishment)" is warranted, perhaps just the [feeling](dictionary.md#feeling) of [guilt](dictionary.md#guilt), we do not think it "a case of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)" (Mill 1998: ch. 5). Many philosophers today broadly concur with these Millian sentiments (Adams 1999: 238; Baier 1966; Brandt 1979: 163–176; Gibbard 1990: 42; Skorupski 1999: 142).[^5] Matters of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) are the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community's "business," as Kurt Baier puts it (1966: 223). When we are morally [obligated](dictionary.md#obligate), we are not morally [free](dictionary.md#free) to [act otherwise](dictionary.md#act%20otherwise); [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to hold us [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) if we do. [Moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are thus *to* others in a more robust way than those of logic are.[^6] Anyone who feels guilty about logical errors would seem to have a "[moralized](dictionary.md#moralize)" [sense](dictionary.md#sense) of the logical.

I develop this theme and [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that any [account](dictionary.md#account) of the [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [normativity](dictionary.md#normativity) of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) that fails to capture this [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) element is deficient. What's more, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that this [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) aspect also helps to [explain](dictionary.md#explain) why [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s purport to be supremely [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) in the more familiar [sense](dictionary.md#sense) of being [categorical](dictionary.md#categorical) and [overriding](dictionary.md#override).

The root of this latter [explanation](dictionary.md#explanation) is the conceptual connection between [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) and [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility), specifically, [obligation's](dictionary.md#obligation) tie to warranted [blame](dictionary.md#blame). Along lines similar to Bernard Williams and others, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that [blame](dictionary.md#blame) implies that the [blamed](dictionary.md#blame) [agent](dictionary.md#agent) had [reason](dictionary.md#reason) enough not to do what we [blame](dictionary.md#blame) him for doing in something like the way that Moore held that [asserting](dictionary.md#assert) *p* implies that one [believes](dictionary.md#believe) that *p* (Gibbard 1990: 299– 300; Moore 1942: 540–543; Shafer-Landau 2003: 181–183; Skorupski 1999: 42–43; Williams 1995: 40–44). Just as it is unintelligible to [assert](dictionary.md#assert) something but [deny](dictionary.md#deny) that one [believes](dictionary.md#believe) it, so also does it make no [sense](dictionary.md#sense) to [blame](dictionary.md#blame) someone for doing something and then add that he had, nonetheless, [sufficient](dictionary.md#sufficient) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to do it, all things [considered](dictionary.md#consider). It is [common](dictionary.md#common) to [blame](dictionary.md#blame) and other [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) through which we hold one another [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) that they [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) not just that the [person](dictionary.md#person) shouldn't have done what he did "morally speaking," but that he shouldn't have done it period. A [person](dictionary.md#person) who in one moment "admits" his [guilt](dictionary.md#guilt), but in the next, asserts that he had, nonetheless, [good](dictionary.md#good) and [sufficient](dictionary.md#sufficient) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for doing what he did could hardly be said to have accepted [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) for his [action](dictionary.md#action). Or to put the point the other way around, if someone can [establish](dictionary.md#establish) that he had [sufficient](dictionary.md#sufficient) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to do what he did, then he [will](dictionary.md#will) have [accounted](dictionary.md#account) for himself and shown thereby that [blame](dictionary.md#blame) is unwarranted.

### **The Scope of [Moral Obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)**

I should emphasize that nothing in the idea of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) as involving reciprocal [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) [rules](dictionary.md#rules) out its scope or content extending beyond the needs and [interests](dictionary.md#interest) of [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [individuals](dictionary.md#individual) [considered](dictionary.md#consider) as such. For all I say in this book, what we are morally [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) for might include, for example, the protection of cultural treasures, wilderness, and/or the welfare of other [sentient](dictionary.md#sentient) beings, quite independently of the relation any of these have to the [interests](dictionary.md#interest) of [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [persons](dictionary.md#person). I take no stand here on whether or not this is so. What I say [entails](dictionary.md#entail) that if we have such [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s, then these are among the things we [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agents](dictionary.md#agent) have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) of one another. Of course, even if we do not, even if, say, [harming](dictionary.md#harm) wilderness or [members](dictionary.md#member) of other species were not in itself to [violate](dictionary.md#violate) any [demand](dictionary.md#demand) for which we can be held morally [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable), there would still be weighty [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) against such [harm](dictionary.md#harm). In any case, what I do [argue](dictionary.md#argue) is that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s essentially include [demands](dictionary.md#demand) [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [individuals](dictionary.md#individual) have [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to make of one another as such and that we are [committed](dictionary.md#commit) to the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to make these [demands](dictionary.md#demand) by [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint. Whether we are morally [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) for more is obviously an important question, but it is not one I can [address](dictionary.md#address) here.[^7]

Of course, even if [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s concerning other species, say, can be accommodated within the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) framework I am sketching, it may still be [objected](dictionary.md#object) that there is no place in it for the idea that these [obligations](dictionary.md#obligation) are [owed](dictionary.md#owe) to the beings themselves if they lack [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence and so, according to my [argument](dictionary.md#argument), the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) anything. But the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) viewI develop may have resources for response even here. First, although I am bound to insist that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation), like the [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of a [right](dictionary.md#right), cannot be understood independently of [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) [demands](dictionary.md#demand), the thought that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s can be [owed](dictionary.md#owe) to beings who lack [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence might be able to be elaborated in terms of trustees' (for example, the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community's) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [treatment](dictionary.md#treatment) on their behalf (perhaps also to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [rights](dictionary.md#right), compensation, and so on, for them). Thus, Dr. Seuss's character the Lorax (a [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) being) declares, "I speak for the trees" (Dr. Seuss 1971). Second, to the extent that we find the thought that we [owe](dictionary.md#owe) [obligations](dictionary.md#obligation) to nonrational beings a [natural](dictionary.md#natural) thing to think, it seems likely that we also impute to them a proto- or quasi-second-personality, for example, as when we see an [animal's](dictionary.md#animal) or an infant's cry as a [form](dictionary.md#form) of complaint. In any case, what I seek to show in this book is that the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence that makes us [subject](dictionary.md#subject) to [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) also gives us an [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to make [claims](dictionary.md#claim) and [demands](dictionary.md#demand) of one another as [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community. Whether the scope or content of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) extends farther is a question I do not here [consider](dictionary.md#consider).[^8]

### **Vindicating [Moral Obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation): The Kantian Project**

Whether [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s purport to be supremely [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) is one question, but whether they actually are is another.[^9] The project of vindicating [morality's](dictionary.md#morality) [putative](dictionary.md#putative) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) poses one of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) philosophy's great challenges. A mark of the Kantian tradition has been to take the challenge seriously and attempt to meet it (Darwall 1983; Gewirth 1978; Korsgaard 1996f; Nagel 1970). Kant's own strategy apparently changed significantly from the *Groundwork* to *The Critique of [Practical](dictionary.md#practical) [Reason](dictionary.md#reason),* however. What held constant throughout was his "[Reciprocity](dictionary.md#reciprocity) [Thesis](dictionary.md#thesis)," Kant's conviction that the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) lawis [equivalent](dictionary.md#equivalent) to what he called "[autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will)": "the [property](dictionary.md#property) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) by which it is a [law](dictionary.md#law) to itself (independently of any [property](dictionary.md#property) of the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of volition)" (Allison 1986; Kant 1996b: 440).

[Consider](dictionary.md#consider), first, howKant argues in the *Groundwork.* At the [end](dictionary.md#end) of *Groundwork*'s section 2, Kant remarks that it is consistent with his [arguments](dictionary.md#argument) to that point that [morality](dictionary.md#morality) is nothing but a "figment of the [mind](dictionary.md#mind)." He [believes](dictionary.md#believe) he has already proven in sections 1 and 2 that [morality's](dictionary.md#morality) [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) [principle](dictionary.md#principle) is the [Categorical Imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) (CI) and that it holds *[if-and-only-if](dictionary.md#if-and-only-if)*, the [will](dictionary.md#will) has the [property](dictionary.md#property) of [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) (the [Reciprocity](dictionary.md#reciprocity) [Thesis](dictionary.md#thesis)). But so far he has simply [analyzed](dictionary.md#analyze) the "generally accepted" [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of [morality](dictionary.md#morality). All he has shown, consequently, is that *[if-and-only-if](dictionary.md#if-and-only-if)*, there is such a thing as [morality](dictionary.md#morality) is conceived to be, then "the [categorical imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative), and with it [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will), is [true](dictionary.md#true) and absolutely [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) as an *[a priori](dictionary.md#a%20priori)* [principle](dictionary.md#principle)" (1996b: 445). To vindicate the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law), however, it is insufficient to [establish](dictionary.md#establish) this [biconditional](dictionary.md#biconditional), since it is merely an [analytic](dictionary.md#analytic) [truth](dictionary.md#truth) that is consistent with [morality's](dictionary.md#morality) and [autonomy's](dictionary.md#autonomy) both being mere "figments." He must [establish](dictionary.md#establish) either that [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) really holds or that the CI does (either [will](dictionary.md#will) do because of the [Reciprocity](dictionary.md#reciprocity) [Thesis](dictionary.md#thesis)). And both, he says, are synthetic *[a priori](dictionary.md#a%20priori)* [claims](dictionary.md#claim) that require the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) critique of [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) he sets about providing in section 3.

In *Groundwork* 3, Kant attempts to [establish](dictionary.md#establish) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) as an [independent](dictionary.md#independent) [premise](dictionary.md#premise) and to [prove](dictionary.md#prove) the CI on its basis. He [claims](dictionary.md#claim) that [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) is a [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) [presupposition](dictionary.md#presupposition) of the [practical](dictionary.md#practical) standpoint—we "cannot [act otherwise](dictionary.md#act%20otherwise) than *under the idea of [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom)*"—and then argues (via the [Reciprocity](dictionary.md#reciprocity) [Thesis](dictionary.md#thesis)) that in [presupposing](dictionary.md#presuppose) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) a [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agent](dictionary.md#agent) is [committed](dictionary.md#commit) to the CI (the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law)) (1996b: 448). [Contemporary](dictionary.md#contemporary) Kantians, most notably Christine Korsgaard, often pursue some version of this strategy also (Hill 1985; Korsgaard 1996b, 1996e, 1996f).

I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that any such attempt must fail. [Autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will), as Kant defines it, is a [form](dictionary.md#form) of [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) that is distinctively [practical](dictionary.md#practical) and that lacks any analogue in theoretical [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning). However, the only [argument](dictionary.md#argument) that Kant gives in *Groundwork* 3 (1996b: 448) for the [proposition](dictionary.md#proposition) that we must [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) in [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning) is that we must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) a [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) of [reason](dictionary.md#reason) in [forming](dictionary.md#form) any [judgment](dictionary.md#judgment), whether [practical](dictionary.md#practical) or theoretical. Kant's idea seems to be that if we see our thinking or [judgments](dictionary.md#judgment) in any area as simply directed from without, we [will](dictionary.md#will) not be able to regard ourselves as [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) or making [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [judgments](dictionary.md#judgment) in that area. No doubt this is [true](dictionary.md#true), but it doesn't followthat the [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) on the basis of which we [judge](dictionary.md#judge) are not themselves drawn from features of our [judgment's](dictionary.md#judgment) [object](dictionary.md#object) (and hence, in [practical](dictionary.md#practical) deliberation, from [properties](dictionary.md#property) of the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of our [desire](dictionary.md#desire) and volition). When we [reason](dictionary.md#reason) about what to [believe](dictionary.md#believe), at least about empirical matters, for example, there is a clear [sense](dictionary.md#sense) in which we need to see our thinking as responding to [independent](dictionary.md#independent) [objects](dictionary.md#object) and states of the world about which we are attempting to [form](dictionary.md#form) [beliefs](dictionary.md#belief).[^10] Theoretical [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) evidently involves no [form](dictionary.md#form) of [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) that is analogous to [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will), the [will's](dictionary.md#will) being "a [law](dictionary.md#law) to itself (independently of any [properties](dictionary.md#property) of the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of [[desire](dictionary.md#desire) and] volition)" (Kant 1996b: 440).

But neither, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), need [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) be [assumed](dictionary.md#assume) in just any intelligible [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning). [Consider](dictionary.md#consider) what [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning) would be like if it were structurally analogous to [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [belief](dictionary.md#belief) formation about the empirical world. (I am not saying for a moment that this is a [plausible](dictionary.md#plausible) picture of [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning), only that it is an intelligible one, and that since [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) would not be [assumed](dictionary.md#assume) in such [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning), it cannot, therefore, be an inescapable [presupposition](dictionary.md#presupposition) of the [practical](dictionary.md#practical) standpoint.) A naïve theoretical reasoner takes her experience as [evidence](dictionary.md#evidence) of states of an [independent](dictionary.md#independent) world (the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of [correct](dictionary.md#correct) [beliefs](dictionary.md#belief)). An analogously "naïve" [practical](dictionary.md#practical) reasoner might take her [desires](dictionary.md#desire) and other [forms](dictionary.md#form) of "[practical](dictionary.md#practical) experience" like [pleasure](dictionary.md#pleasure) and pain as [forms](dictionary.md#form) of epistemic access also, only this time, not to the world as it is, but to how it would be [good](dictionary.md#good) or [bad](dictionary.md#bad) for the world to be, how it should or should not be.[^11] To an [agent](dictionary.md#agent) with a [desire](dictionary.md#desire) that *p,* it [will](dictionary.md#will) seem that the world should be such that *p,* as if *p* would be a [good](dictionary.md#good) thing, hence, as if there is [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for her to bring *p* about, and similarly for experiences of being pleased or pained that *p.* Naïve [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning) on this basis would therefore see [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) as deriving from features of the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of [desire](dictionary.md#desire) and volition and so would not [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) in Kant's [sense](dictionary.md#sense).

So I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that Kant's *Groundwork* [argument](dictionary.md#argument) fails, as must, indeed, any [argument](dictionary.md#argument) that attempts to [prove](dictionary.md#prove) that [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) is an inescapable [assumption](dictionary.md#assumption) of any [possible](dictionary.md#possible) [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning).[^12] The problem, as I diagnose it, is that it is only deliberation from the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint that requires us to [assume](dictionary.md#assume) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will).

By the time Kant wrote *Critique of [Practical](dictionary.md#practical) [Reason](dictionary.md#reason),* he had apparently abandoned the *Groundwork*'s strategy of trying to [establish](dictionary.md#establish) the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law) from a [prior](dictionary.md#prior) [premise](dictionary.md#premise) of [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) as an inescapable [assumption](dictionary.md#assumption) of any [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning). There he holds that we have no [independent](dictionary.md#independent) way of [establishing](dictionary.md#establish) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) other than through our [consciousness](dictionary.md#consciousness) of a [particular](dictionary.md#particular) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [reason](dictionary.md#reason), namely, being bound by the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law). What Kant calls the "[fact](dictionary.md#fact) of [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" (1996a: 31), the [awareness](dictionary.md#awareness) of our [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) through [consciousness](dictionary.md#consciousness) of being bound by the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law), itself assumes [morality's](dictionary.md#morality) supremacy and cannot therefore be [used](dictionary.md#use) to [establish](dictionary.md#establish) it.

I think Kant was [right](dictionary.md#right) to give up the strategy of the *Groundwork* and to [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that [consciousness](dictionary.md#consciousness) of [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) involves an [awareness](dictionary.md#awareness) of being bound by and able to [act](dictionary.md#act) on a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [kind](dictionary.md#kind). Perhaps we can now glimpse why I [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that the requisite [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) must be [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal). First, as I [mentioned](dictionary.md#mention) in the last chapter, any [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) or acknowledgment commits us to the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person), conceived as [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority), and to the idea that [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) alike are [capable](dictionary.md#capable) of [acting](dictionary.md#act) on [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that are [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in this [authority](dictionary.md#authority) and so are [irreducible](dictionary.md#irreducible) to the [value](dictionary.md#value) of any [outcome](dictionary.md#outcome) or state (hence to any [property](dictionary.md#property) of any [object](dictionary.md#object) of [desire](dictionary.md#desire)). [Second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) thus commits us to the idea that [agents](dictionary.md#agent) [capable](dictionary.md#capable) of entering into relations of [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) must have within this [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence) a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) that is a [source](dictionary.md#source) of [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) and [norms](dictionary.md#norm) independently of any features of [desired](dictionary.md#desire) (or [desirable](dictionary.md#desirable)) [outcomes](dictionary.md#outcome) or states along with the [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to [act](dictionary.md#act) on these [norms](dictionary.md#norm) and [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). When we acknowledge the summons of another [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agent](dictionary.md#agent), we confront, in effect, the "[fact](dictionary.md#fact) of [reason](dictionary.md#reason)." We [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [rational](dictionary.md#rational) beings and our [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to [act](dictionary.md#act) on a "[law](dictionary.md#law)" or [reason](dictionary.md#reason)—a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in this [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity)—that derives not from the [value](dictionary.md#value) of any [state of affairs](dictionary.md#state%20of%20affairs) or [outcome](dictionary.md#outcome) that might be the [object](dictionary.md#object) of a [desire](dictionary.md#desire), but, ultimately, from what it is to be one [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [person](dictionary.md#person) interacting with others.

Second, [consider](dictionary.md#consider) briefly howthe "[fact](dictionary.md#fact) of [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" [functions](dictionary.md#function) within Kant's own [argument](dictionary.md#argument) in the second *Critique.* Kant asks us to imagine someone whose prince [demands](dictionary.md#demand) that he give [false](dictionary.md#false) witness against an [honorable](dictionary.md#honorable) man on pain of [death](dictionary.md#death) (1996a: 30). Kant notes that no one can say for sure what he would do in such a situation, but Kant nonetheless insists that anyone in the situation would have to admit that he could refuse the prince's request, since he would [judge](dictionary.md#judge) that he should do so. Because we all already implicitly acknowledge the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [law](dictionary.md#law), we are forced to [conclude](dictionary.md#conclude) that we have the [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) to [act](dictionary.md#act) on it. We cannot coherently think that it is impossible to do something and still think, from the [practical](dictionary.md#practical) standpoint, that it is something we should do. If we can't do something, then the [practical](dictionary.md#practical) question is what else to do in light of that [fact](dictionary.md#fact).

Obviously, if acknowledging the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) is what requires us to [assume](dictionary.md#assume) we can [act](dictionary.md#act) on a [law](dictionary.md#law) that binds us independently of our [desires](dictionary.md#desire) (including for survival), then we cannot [assume](dictionary.md#assume) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) in an [argument for](dictionary.md#argument%20for) the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation). But as I've said, Kant is no longer interested in that strategy. Nonetheless, Kant clearly takes this example as [evidence](dictionary.md#evidence), not just that anyone must admit that he could [comply](dictionary.md#comply) with this [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) (in [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) it), but that he can [comply](dictionary.md#comply) with the [Categorical Imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) in general, since Kant presents a [formulation](dictionary.md#formulation) of the CI ("So [act](dictionary.md#act) that the [maxim](dictionary.md#maxim) of your [will](dictionary.md#will) could always hold at the same time as a [principle](dictionary.md#principle) in a giving of [universal](dictionary.md#universal) [law](dictionary.md#law)") just after the passage we have been discussing (1996a: 30).[^13] And that, after all, is what would be [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) for him to have [established](dictionary.md#establish) in [order](dictionary.md#order) to show that we must [accept](dictionary.md#accept) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will)—that we are bound by a *[formal](dictionary.md#formal)* [principle](dictionary.md#principle) of the [will](dictionary.md#will). But why should that be? All we [know](dictionary.md#know) so far is that we can [act](dictionary.md#act) on a [principle](dictionary.md#principle) of [right](dictionary.md#right) we [accept](dictionary.md#accept), irrespectively of our [desires](dictionary.md#desire) for any [outcome](dictionary.md#outcome). It is consistent with this that, as deontological intuitionists like Richard [Price](dictionary.md#price) (1974) and W. D. Ross (1930) [believed](dictionary.md#believe), this is explainable by an [independent](dictionary.md#independent) [fact](dictionary.md#fact) of [right](dictionary.md#right) rather than by anything like [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will). Why suppose there must be some [formal](dictionary.md#formal) [principle](dictionary.md#principle) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) like the CI that stands behind our [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s?

Suppose we were to [consider](dictionary.md#consider), however, not just that anyone in the situation Kant describes [ought](dictionary.md#ought) to reject the prince's [demand](dictionary.md#demand), but also that he would be morally [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) for doing so. In the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) of holding him [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), we would have to [assume](dictionary.md#assume) that he had within him a [source](dictionary.md#source) of [motivation](dictionary.md#motivation) to do as he was morally [obligated](dictionary.md#obligate). We cannot intelligibly hold someone to a [demand](dictionary.md#demand) as a [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [agent](dictionary.md#agent) without supposing that he could hold himself to that same [demand](dictionary.md#demand) by [acting](dictionary.md#act) on the relevant [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). And if we think that any [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [person](dictionary.md#person) in that situation would be thus [answerable](dictionary.md#answerable), we are [committed](dictionary.md#commit) to thinking that what makes a [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [person](dictionary.md#person) [subject](dictionary.md#subject) to [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) must itself include a [source](dictionary.md#source) of [motivation](dictionary.md#motivation) to do as he is morally [obligated](dictionary.md#obligate). The need for this [presupposition](dictionary.md#presupposition) comes not from supposing there to be [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for someone to do something, regardless of their [priority](dictionary.md#priority) or weight but rather from the distinctively [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that are involved in [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation). It comes from what Gary Watson calls "constraints of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [address](dictionary.md#address)" (1987: 263, 264). It [follows](dictionary.md#follow), I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), that the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence that makes us [subject](dictionary.md#subject) to [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) must include a [source](dictionary.md#source) of the ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) in which [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) consists, along with the [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) to [act](dictionary.md#act) on these [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). In [presupposing](dictionary.md#presuppose) this, we effectively [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will). The [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) of [will](dictionary.md#will) that make us apt to be held [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence, is a "lawto itself," since it is the basis of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority).

### **A [Second-Personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [Interpretation](dictionary.md#interpretation) of the CI**

What then does [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence consist in? Well, it must consist in something like the [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) to make [demands](dictionary.md#demand) of oneself from a [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint: in being able to choose to do something *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* it is consistent with [demands](dictionary.md#demand) one (or anyone) would make of anyone (hence that one would make of oneself) from a standpoint we can share as mutually [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) [persons](dictionary.md#person). But that is just a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) version of the CI. In [fact](dictionary.md#fact), the most [natural](dictionary.md#natural) way of interpreting the CI and kindred [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [principles](dictionary.md#principle) like the [Golden Rule](dictionary.md#golden%20rule) is [second-personally](dictionary.md#second-personally), in terms of [demands](dictionary.md#demand) that one (anyone) would sensibly make of all from the shared standpoint of a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community. What matters for [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) is not what one would like or [prefer](dictionary.md#prefer) all [people](dictionary.md#people) do, but what one would expect of others, what [demands](dictionary.md#demand) one could endorse anyone's being able to hold others to as [members](dictionary.md#member) of a community of mutually [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) [equals](dictionary.md#equal). What forces an [assumption](dictionary.md#assumption) of [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will), therefore, is the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) aspect of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation), that is, that what is morally [obligatory](dictionary.md#obligatory) is what we are [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) to one another for doing.

But isn't [acting](dictionary.md#act) on [demands](dictionary.md#demand) that others can make of one [heteronomy](dictionary.md#heteronomy) rather than [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy), being governed by them rather than by oneself? Or, to put it another way, how could [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) consist in a [law](dictionary.md#law) that comes from nothing outside of the [will](dictionary.md#will) itself if it is [realized](dictionary.md#realize) in [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) interaction? The response to this [objection](dictionary.md#objection) is that when one decides to reject the prince's [demand](dictionary.md#demand) because this is what the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community authoritatively [demands](dictionary.md#demand), the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) perspective of a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community is as much one's own as it is anyone else's. One [demands](dictionary.md#demand) the conduct of oneself from a point of viewone shares as a [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [person](dictionary.md#person).

### **A [Foundation](dictionary.md#foundation) for Contractualism**

An [account](dictionary.md#account) of the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint along the lines that I develop in this book provides the most [natural](dictionary.md#natural) way of motivating the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [theory](dictionary.md#theory) [known](dictionary.md#know) as "contractualism." Contractualists sees [morality](dictionary.md#morality) as most fundamentally concerned with "how *[persons](dictionary.md#person) are to relate to one another,*" to quote one insightful commentator (Kumar 1999: 284).[^14] Or as Scanlon puts it, "The contractualist [ideal](dictionary.md#ideal) . . . is meant to characterize" a specific "relation" with others: "[mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [recognition](dictionary.md#recognition)" (1998: 162). [Moral](dictionary.md#moral) [principles](dictionary.md#principle) have a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) *[role](dictionary.md#role)* on a contractualist view: they mediate [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [respect](dictionary.md#respect).[^15] They don't just tell us what [actions](dictionary.md#action) we should or must [perform](dictionary.md#perform); they mediate a [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) interpersonal *relation:* [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [respect](dictionary.md#respect) between mutually [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) [persons](dictionary.md#person).[^16] These are all irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) matters.

For Scanlon, the problem of accounting for [morality's](dictionary.md#morality) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) is that of [explaining](dictionary.md#explain) "the *[priority](dictionary.md#priority)* of [right](dictionary.md#right) and [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) over other [values](dictionary.md#value)" or accounting for their special "importance" (1998: 148, 149). In the paper in which he originally formulated the [position](dictionary.md#position), Scanlon (1982) maintained that the "motivational basis" of contractualist [morality](dictionary.md#morality) is a [desire](dictionary.md#desire) to [act](dictionary.md#act) in a way that can be [justified](dictionary.md#justified) to others. In *What We [Owe](dictionary.md#owe) to Each Other,* however, Scanlon departs from his [prior](dictionary.md#prior) view and [claims](dictionary.md#claim) that contractualism's basis is the "[value](dictionary.md#value)" and "appeal" of [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to others in the relation of [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [recognition](dictionary.md#recognition), both in itself and as an ineliminable aspect of other valuable relations such as friendship (1998: 158–168).

This is obviously an attractive idea, but like Mill's attempt to [explain](dictionary.md#explain) the bindingness of [morality](dictionary.md#morality) in the appeal of "[unity](dictionary.md#unity) with our fellow [creatures](dictionary.md#creature)," to which Scanlon in [fact](dictionary.md#fact) [compares](dictionary.md#compare) it, it is hard to see how it can adequately [account](dictionary.md#account) for the nonoptional character of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) (Mill 1998: ch. 3). This is another instance of Strawson's Point; such an [argument](dictionary.md#argument) seems to provide a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind](dictionary.md#kind). By [contrast](dictionary.md#contrast), the approach I sketch [promises](dictionary.md#promise) to [explain](dictionary.md#explain) howthe [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to make [claims](dictionary.md#claim) and [demands](dictionary.md#demand) on one another as [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [persons](dictionary.md#person) is something to which we are jointly [committed](dictionary.md#commit) whenever we take up the secondperson stance more generally rather than simply being an ineliminable aspect of interpersonal relations we find appealing.

A central [issue](dictionary.md#issue) in the [debate](dictionary.md#debate) between consequentialist [theories](dictionary.md#theory) of [right](dictionary.md#right) and deontological [theories](dictionary.md#theory) such as contractualism has been whether a satisfying philosophical [rationale](dictionary.md#rationale) can be provided for agent-relative restrictions ("deontological constraints") (Nagel 1986; Scheffler 1982). Consequentialists since Moore have [argued](dictionary.md#argue) that if, for example, betraying or causing [harm](dictionary.md#harm) to others is to be avoided, then that must be because it is a [bad](dictionary.md#bad) thing.[^17] And if it is [bad](dictionary.md#bad), then it is equally [bad](dictionary.md#bad) regardless of the perpetrator. So if, for example, an [agent](dictionary.md#agent) could do something that would amount to her betraying another [person](dictionary.md#person) but it would also prevent an exactly similar betrayal involving two other [people](dictionary.md#people), say because another would-be betrayer would be sufficiently shocked at seeing the first [agent's](dictionary.md#agent) betrayal that she would give up her treacherous plans, then these two [outcomes](dictionary.md#outcome) should [cancel](dictionary.md#cancel) each other out from the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) point of view. The [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that one betrayal would be by the [agent](dictionary.md#agent) herself should make no [intrinsic](dictionary.md#intrinsic) difference to what there is [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for the [agent](dictionary.md#agent) to do. There [will](dictionary.md#will) [end](dictionary.md#end) up being a net gain of one betrayal in the world whatever she does.

It is well [known](dictionary.md#know) that, in addition to being part of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [common](dictionary.md#common) [sense](dictionary.md#sense), agent-relative constraints can be derived within contractualism or, for that matter, within indirect consequentialist approaches such as [rule](dictionary.md#rule) [utilitarianism](dictionary.md#utilitarianism).[^18] The problem has remained of howto give any of these derivations a deeper philosophical [rationale](dictionary.md#rationale) that itself confirms rather than undermines [the case](dictionary.md#the%20case) for agent-relative constraints. The problem with indirect [consequentialism](dictionary.md#consequentialism), for example, is that even if we think there are (agent-neutral) consequentialist [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to call [actions](dictionary.md#action) that [violate](dictionary.md#violate) [common](dictionary.md#common) [sense](dictionary.md#sense) agent-relative [moral](dictionary.md#moral) constraints "[wrong](dictionary.md#wrong)," or to want [people](dictionary.md#people) (ourselves included) to think them [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong), it is not obvious how a consequentialist can herself sensibly think (simultaneously with [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) the deeper agent-neutralist [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons)) that [agents](dictionary.md#agent) really should avoid [performing](dictionary.md#perform) such [actions](dictionary.md#action), when doing so would advance the overall agent-neutral [value](dictionary.md#value).

If a [foundation](dictionary.md#foundation) for contractualism can be found in [commitments](dictionary.md#commitment) within the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint, this can provide, I [believe](dictionary.md#believe), the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [rationale](dictionary.md#rationale) for agent-relative restrictions that is needed. It would vindicate [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that are in their [nature](dictionary.md#nature) relational, that concern, not howit would be [good](dictionary.md#good) for the world to be anyway, or even what [kinds](dictionary.md#kind) of [acts](dictionary.md#act) are called for by their [intrinsic](dictionary.md#intrinsic) [nature](dictionary.md#nature), but howwe are to relate to one another [owing](dictionary.md#owe) to [claims](dictionary.md#claim) and [demands](dictionary.md#demand) that we cannot avoid [assuming](dictionary.md#assume) we have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) to each other as one [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [person](dictionary.md#person) among others. It would provide the [right](dictionary.md#right) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [reason](dictionary.md#reason).

[^2]: Indeed, the very idea of an "excuse" is not [internal](dictionary.md#internal) to the [rules](dictionary.md#rules) of logic; it must be understood in relation to a broader [context](dictionary.md#context) that includes other [norms](dictionary.md#norm).
[^3]: I don't mean, of course, that logical errors aren't [subject](dictionary.md#subject) to [criticism](dictionary.md#criticism), or that we don't sometimes [use](dictionary.md#use) words like "[blame](dictionary.md#blame)," as when a teacher says that he doesn't [blame](dictionary.md#blame) his student for a given error on a first try.

[^9]: Alternatively, we could say that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are supremely [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) by [definition](dictionary.md#definition), but then the question just becomes whether the specific injunctions we take to be [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s in [fact](dictionary.md#fact). So far as I can see, nothing hangs on this [semantic](dictionary.md#semantic) choice.
[^10]: This point holds whether or not transcendental [idealism](dictionary.md#idealism) is [true](dictionary.md#true). Even a transcendental idealist [will](dictionary.md#will) need to draw a distinction between [object](dictionary.md#object)- or state-responsive thinking (like that involved in [ordinary](dictionary.md#ordinary) [belief](dictionary.md#belief) formation about states of the world, i.e., the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of empirical [belief](dictionary.md#belief)) and thinking that isn't. It is significant in this regard that Fichte [contrasts](dictionary.md#contrast) [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) from any we can have in "representational activity" (2000: 19), as does Kant in the *Critique of [Practical](dictionary.md#practical) [Reason](dictionary.md#reason)* (1996a: 20).

[^12]: As I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) in Chapter 9, I [differ](dictionary.md#differ) here with writers like Korsgaard and Wood who attempt to provide a [sound](dictionary.md#sound) reconstruction of the [Formula](dictionary.md#formula) of [Humanity](dictionary.md#humanity), [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy), and related [concepts](dictionary.md#concept) from [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of [practical reasoning](dictionary.md#practical%20reasoning) alone (Korsgaard 1996b, 1996e, 1996f; Wood 1999). As I point out in more detail later, although Korsgaard shows a keen [appreciation](dictionary.md#appreciation) of the [role](dictionary.md#role) of [reciprocity](dictionary.md#reciprocity) and [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) for a Kantian framework (Korsgaard 1996a, 1996d: 301), she also [believes](dictionary.md#believe) that [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) and the [Categorical Imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) in its various [formulations](dictionary.md#formulation) are transcendental [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of the [practical](dictionary.md#practical) standpoint. I [believe](dictionary.md#believe) this to be mistaken. In my view, there is no way of deriving these ideas outside of the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint and within a comprehensive [theory](dictionary.md#theory) of [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that is enriched by it.
