# PART I

## 1. The Main Ideas I

[People](dictionary.md#people) are self-originating [sources](dictionary.md#source) of [claims](dictionary.md#claim).  
—john rawls, "kantian [constructivism](dictionary.md#constructivism) in [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [theory](dictionary.md#theory)"

Call *the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint* the perspective you and I take up when we make and acknowledge [claims](dictionary.md#claim) on one another's conduct and [will](dictionary.md#will).[^1] This might be [explicit](dictionary.md#explicit), in [speech](dictionary.md#speech), as with the performatives J. L. Austin botanized—[demanding](dictionary.md#demand), [reproaching](dictionary.md#reproach), apologizing, and so on—or only [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit), in thought, as with Strawsonian [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [feelings](dictionary.md#feeling) like [resentment](dictionary.md#resentment) and [guilt](dictionary.md#guilt) (Austin 1975; Strawson 1968).[^2] But whether [explicit](dictionary.md#explicit) and voiced—"You talkin' to me?"—or only [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) and felt, as in a resentful sulk, the I-you-me [structure](dictionary.md#structure) of reciprocal [address](dictionary.md#address) runs throughout thought and [speech](dictionary.md#speech) from the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) point of view.

Austin taught us that [speech act](dictionary.md#speech%20act)s [addressed](dictionary.md#address) to others have "[felicity conditions](dictionary.md#felicity%20conditions)" that must be met for them to come off properly or, indeed, at all (Austin 1975). For an [utterance](dictionary.md#utterance) to count as a command, for example, [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [conventional](dictionary.md#conventional) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) relations must be in the background, and this must be [common](dictionary.md#common) [knowledge](dictionary.md#knowledge) between [speaker](dictionary.md#speaker) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee). Austin was not concerned with [ethics](dictionary.md#ethics), however. The questions he cared about were social and linguistic: What [conditions](dictionary.md#condition) must be satisfied for [speech act](dictionary.md#speech%20act)s to succeed in [conventional](dictionary.md#conventional) terms? It is enough for an [utterance](dictionary.md#utterance) to amount to a command in this [sense](dictionary.md#sense) that the [speaker](dictionary.md#speaker) has relevant [authority](dictionary.md#authority) *[de facto](dictionary.md#de%20facto);* she need not have it *[de jure](dictionary.md#de%20jure).*

Our questions, however, are [normative](dictionary.md#normative). A command is a [form](dictionary.md#form) of [address](dictionary.md#address) that purports to give a [person](dictionary.md#person) a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) *([normative](dictionary.md#normative)) [reason](dictionary.md#reason)* for [acting](dictionary.md#act), one I call a *[second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason).*[^3] What makes a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) is that it is [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in *([de jure](dictionary.md#de%20jure))* [authority](dictionary.md#authority) relations that an [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) takes to hold between him and his [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee). Unlike [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of other sorts, therefore, [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) must be able to be [addressed](dictionary.md#address) within these relations.[^4] And, as I show, [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) are [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) also in the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) they make on the [will](dictionary.md#will).

Austinian [felicity conditions](dictionary.md#felicity%20conditions) are what must hold for a [speech act](dictionary.md#speech%20act) to count as an [act](dictionary.md#act) of some conventionally [defined](dictionary.md#define) [kind](dictionary.md#kind), say, a command, or for it not to be what Austin calls an "abuse," that is, a genuine [act](dictionary.md#act) of that [kind](dictionary.md#kind) that nonetheless violates some [convention](dictionary.md#convention) for that [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [act](dictionary.md#act), say, an insincere [promise](dictionary.md#promise) (Austin 1975: 16).[^5] We, however, are interested in what we might call "[normative](dictionary.md#normative) [felicity conditions](dictionary.md#felicity%20conditions)": what must be [true](dictionary.md#true) for [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) actually to exist and be successfully given through [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address).

When someone attempts to give another a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason), she purports to stand in a relevant [authority](dictionary.md#authority) relation to her [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee). I shall say that her [address](dictionary.md#address) *presupposes* this [authority](dictionary.md#authority). By this, I just mean that her having the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) is a [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) [condition](dictionary.md#condition) of the [validity](dictionary.md#validity) of the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) she purports to [address](dictionary.md#address) and is thus a [normative](dictionary.md#normative) felicity [condition](dictionary.md#condition) of successfully giving her [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) the [reason](dictionary.md#reason). *Qua* attempting to give her [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) the [reason](dictionary.md#reason), therefore, she must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) this [authority](dictionary.md#authority), as she must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) the [satisfaction](dictionary.md#satisfaction) of any [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [felicity conditions](dictionary.md#felicity%20conditions) of giving the [reason](dictionary.md#reason).

In addition to the specific [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) carried by [different](dictionary.md#different) specific [forms](dictionary.md#form) of [address](dictionary.md#address), a major [claim](dictionary.md#claim) of this book is that [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) has [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) built into it in general. To enter intelligibly into the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) stance and make [claims](dictionary.md#claim) on and [demands](dictionary.md#demand) of one another at all, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), you and I must [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) that we share a [common](dictionary.md#common) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority), competence, and [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) simply as [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agents](dictionary.md#agent).

### **[Second-Personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [Reasons](dictionary.md#reasons)**

To get the flavor of the [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) point I am trying to make, [compare](dictionary.md#compare) two [different](dictionary.md#different) ways in which you might try to give someone a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to stop causing you pain, say, to remove his foot from on top of yours.

One would be to get him to feel sympathetic concern for you in your plight, thereby leading him to want you to be [free](dictionary.md#free) of pain.[^6] Were he to have this [desire](dictionary.md#desire), he would see your being in pain as a [bad](dictionary.md#bad) thing, a state of the world that there is [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for him (or, indeed, for anyone who is able) to change. And he would most naturally see his [desire](dictionary.md#desire) that you be pain-free not as the [source](dictionary.md#source) of this [reason](dictionary.md#reason), but as a [form](dictionary.md#form) of access to a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that is there anyway.[^7] In [desiring](dictionary.md#desire) that you be [free](dictionary.md#free) of pain, he would see this [possible](dictionary.md#possible) [state of affairs](dictionary.md#state%20of%20affairs) as a better way for the world to be, as a [possible](dictionary.md#possible) [outcome](dictionary.md#outcome) or state that, as Moore put it, "[ought](dictionary.md#ought) to exist for its own sake" (Moore 1993: 34).[^8]

Structurally, the situation would be entirely analogous to a purely epistemic case, for example, one in which you give him [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) that you are in [fact](dictionary.md#fact) in pain. Were he to credit the way things seem from the perspective of his [desire](dictionary.md#desire), he would [accept](dictionary.md#accept) a *state-of-the-world-regarding* and *agent-neutral* [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for removing his foot.[^9] The [reason](dictionary.md#reason) would not be essentially for him as the [agent](dictionary.md#agent) causing another [person](dictionary.md#person) pain. It would exist, most fundamentally, for anyone who is in a [position](dictionary.md#position) to effect your relief and therefore for him, since he is well placed to do so.[^10] Finally, in "giving" him the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) in this way, you wouldn't so much be [addressing](dictionary.md#address) it to him as getting him to see that it is there anyway, independently of your getting him to see it or even of your [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to do so.[^11] There are two points here. First, in pointing to the [reason](dictionary.md#reason), you would be directing him epistemically rather than practically, albeit on a question of [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reason](dictionary.md#reason). *Qua* this [form](dictionary.md#form) of reason-giving, you would be asking him to agree, as it were, that there is a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for him to do something rather than asking him to agree to do it. Any [claims](dictionary.md#claim) you might make would thus be on his [beliefs](dictionary.md#belief) about [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) and not directly on his [will](dictionary.md#will). Second, your being able to give him the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) would not depend in any way on his seeing you as trying to give it to him or as having any competence or [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to do so. Anything you might do to get him to see the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) would serve. It might be most [effective](dictionary.md#effective), indeed, if he were to see you as so defenseless and vulnerable as to be unable even to [reason](dictionary.md#reason) with him, like a young child.

Alternatively, you might lay a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [address](dictionary.md#address) a purportedly [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [demand](dictionary.md#demand). You might say something that asserts or implies your [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that he move his foot and that simultaneously expresses this [demand](dictionary.md#demand). You might [demand](dictionary.md#demand) this as the [person](dictionary.md#person) whose foot he is stepping on, or as a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community, whose [members](dictionary.md#member) [understand](dictionary.md#understand) themselves as [demanding](dictionary.md#demand) that [people](dictionary.md#people) not step on one another's feet, or as both. Whichever, the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) you would [address](dictionary.md#address) would be agent-relative rather than agent-neutral.[^12] It would concern, most fundamentally, his relations to others (and himself) viewed from his perspective within those relations, in this case, that his keeping his foot on yours causes another [person](dictionary.md#person) pain, causes inconvenience, and so on. The [reason](dictionary.md#reason) would not be [addressed](dictionary.md#address) to him as someone who is simply in a [position](dictionary.md#position) to alter the regrettable state of someone's pain or of someone's causing another pain. If he could stop, say, two others from causing gratuitous pain by the shocking spectacle of keeping his foot firmly planted on yours, this second, claim-based (hence [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) would not recommend that he do so.[^13] It would be [addressed](dictionary.md#address) to him, rather, as the [person](dictionary.md#person) causing gratuitous pain to another [person](dictionary.md#person), something we normally [assume](dictionary.md#assume) we have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that [persons](dictionary.md#person) not do to one another.[^14]

What is important for our purposes is that someone can sensibly [accept](dictionary.md#accept) this second [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for moving his foot, one embodied in your [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand), *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* he also accepts your [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) this of him ([second-personally](dictionary.md#second-personally)). That is just what it is to [accept](dictionary.md#accept) something as a [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand).[^15] And if he accepts that you can [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that he move his foot, he must also [accept](dictionary.md#accept) that you [will](dictionary.md#will) have [grounds](dictionary.md#ground) for complaint or some other [form](dictionary.md#form) of accountability-seeking response if he doesn't. Unlike the first state- or outcome-based [reason](dictionary.md#reason), this second is [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) in the [sense](dictionary.md#sense) that, although the first is conceptually [independent](dictionary.md#independent) of the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) involved in making [claims](dictionary.md#claim) and holding [persons](dictionary.md#person) [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), the second is not. *A [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) is one whose [validity](dictionary.md#validity) depends on [presupposed](dictionary.md#presuppose) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) and [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) relations between [persons](dictionary.md#person) and, therefore, on the [possibility](dictionary.md#possibility) of the [reason's](dictionary.md#reason) being [addressed](dictionary.md#address) person-to-person.* [Reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) [addressed](dictionary.md#address) or [presupposed](dictionary.md#presuppose) in [orders](dictionary.md#order), requests, [claims](dictionary.md#claim), [reproaches](dictionary.md#reproach), complaints, [demands](dictionary.md#demand), [promises](dictionary.md#promise), contracts, givings of consent, commands, and so on are all [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) in this [sense](dictionary.md#sense). They simply wouldn't exist but for their [role](dictionary.md#role) in [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address). And their [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) character explains their agentrelativity. As [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) always derive from [agents](dictionary.md#agent)' relations to one another, they are invariably fundamentally agent-relative.[^16]

It is perhaps obvious that [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that depend on [orders](dictionary.md#order) or requests are [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) in this [sense](dictionary.md#sense), but I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s and [demands](dictionary.md#demand) are quite generally [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) also. (This was [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) in my remark above that you might [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that someone stop causing you pain not just as his victim, but also as a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community.) I [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that to [understand](dictionary.md#understand) [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) as related to [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) in the way we normally do, we have to see it as involving [demands](dictionary.md#demand) that are "in force" from the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) point of view, that is, from the ([first-person](dictionary.md#first-person) [plural](dictionary.md#plural)) perspective of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community.[^17] As I clarify presently, however, this does not diminish their [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) character, since that concerns their "[demand](dictionary.md#demand) [addressing](dictionary.md#address)" [quality](dictionary.md#quality).[^18]

Of course, there might be agent-relative [norms](dictionary.md#norm) and [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) constraining our conduct toward one another that are not [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal). We might think of the feet of [persons](dictionary.md#person) as something like sacred [ground](dictionary.md#ground) that we all have [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to avoid stepping on, without supposing that this has anything to do with anyone's [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) this, even [God's](dictionary.md#god). Once, however, we have the idea that there exists a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to forbear stepping on [people's](dictionary.md#people) feet in the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that this is something we can or do reasonably [demand](dictionary.md#demand) of one another, or that we are *[accountable](dictionary.md#accountable)* for this forbearance, we have the idea of a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason)—a [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that simply wouldn't exist but for the [possibility](dictionary.md#possibility) of the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) involved in [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) or [demanding](dictionary.md#demand).

Since [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) are always fundamentally agent-relative, the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) stance is a version of the [first-person](dictionary.md#first-person) standpoint (whether [singular](dictionary.md#singular) or [plural](dictionary.md#plural)). It is the perspective one assumes in [addressing](dictionary.md#address) [practical](dictionary.md#practical) thought or [speech](dictionary.md#speech) to, or acknowledging [address](dictionary.md#address) from, another (whether as an "I" or as part of a "we") and, in so doing, making or acknowledging a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) on the [will](dictionary.md#will). It involves practically directed and [directive](dictionary.md#directive) thought, thought that is [addressed](dictionary.md#address) to, and that makes a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) on, a [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agent](dictionary.md#agent). What the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) stance excludes is the third-person perspective, that is, regarding, for [practical](dictionary.md#practical) purposes, others (and oneself), not in relation to oneself, but as they are (or one is) "objectively" or "agent-neutrally" (including as related to the [person](dictionary.md#person) one is). And it [rules](dictionary.md#rules) out as well [first-personal](dictionary.md#first-personal) thought that lacks an [addressing](dictionary.md#address), [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) aspect.

Thus, although [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) [address](dictionary.md#address) is always also [first-personal](dictionary.md#first-personal), it is never merely [first-personal](dictionary.md#first-personal). One can occupy a [first-person](dictionary.md#first-person) perspective, whether [singular](dictionary.md#singular) or [plural](dictionary.md#plural), without explicitly [addressing](dictionary.md#address) anyone. And even if all [speech](dictionary.md#speech) (and perhaps thought) involves [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) [address](dictionary.md#address) of some [form](dictionary.md#form), a central theme of this book is that [addressing](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) differs from other [forms](dictionary.md#form) of reason-giving (advice, for example) in the [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) it makes on the [will](dictionary.md#will).

### **Logical and Personal Relations**

It may help to [understand](dictionary.md#understand) the idea of a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to [consider](dictionary.md#consider) it in light of a [criticism](dictionary.md#criticism) that Christine Korsgaard makes of Thomas Nagel's idea that "deontological constraints" are agent-relative.[^19] Quoting Nagel's remark that such constraints "permi[t] a victim always to [object](dictionary.md#object) to those who aim at his [harm](dictionary.md#harm)," Korsgaard replies that "this is absolutely [right](dictionary.md#right)," but that "the [theory](dictionary.md#theory) that deontological [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) are agent-relative . . . cannot accommodate it" (Nagel 1986: 184; Korsgaard 1996d: 297– 298). I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that [moral](dictionary.md#moral) requirements are connected conceptually to an [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance). Korsgaard notes that from the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that an [agent](dictionary.md#agent) has an agent-relative [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to do something, it does not [follow](dictionary.md#follow) that anyone has a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to complain if he does not do it. In our terms, no [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) [follows](dictionary.md#follow). In my view, however, it is not the agent-relativity of the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that explains the deficit. Indeed, as I have said, [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) invariably are fundamentally agent-relative in the most familiar [sense](dictionary.md#sense) of having an ineliminable reflexive [reference](dictionary.md#reference) to the [agent](dictionary.md#agent).[^20] The [truth](dictionary.md#truth) is that whether a [norm](dictionary.md#norm) or [reason](dictionary.md#reason) is agent-relative or agent-neutral, unless it is itself [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal), no [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to [object](dictionary.md#object) [follows](dictionary.md#follow) directly from the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that an [agent](dictionary.md#agent) contravenes it; indeed, no [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to [object](dictionary.md#object) [follows](dictionary.md#follow) whatever the weight or [priority](dictionary.md#priority) of the [norm](dictionary.md#norm) or [reason](dictionary.md#reason). Someone could acknowledge a [norm](dictionary.md#norm) or [reason](dictionary.md#reason), whether agentrelative or agent-neutral, of whatever [priority](dictionary.md#priority) or stringency, without yet acknowledging anyone's [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that he [comply](dictionary.md#comply) with it. The former is, as it were, a matter of the logical [form](dictionary.md#form) or weight of [norms](dictionary.md#norm) or [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), whereas the latter concerns their [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority).

Ultimately, Korsgaard wishes to reject the agent-relative/agent-neutral distinction and to [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that all [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) must be [capable](dictionary.md#capable) of being "shared." As she puts the point regarding the [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) involved in "deontological" [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s, "they supervene on the relationships of [people](dictionary.md#people) who interact with one another. They are intersubjective [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons)" (Korsgaard 1996d: 298). It is a [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) point of [agreement](dictionary.md#agreement) between this [claim](dictionary.md#claim) of Korsgaard's and the outlook I defend in this book that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) in this way (although unlike Korsgaard, I fail to see why all [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) must be shareable in this [sense](dictionary.md#sense)).[^21] In my view, however, the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) aspect of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) cannot be [explained](dictionary.md#explain) by non-second-personal features of their logical [form](dictionary.md#form), nor by whether they are public or private in any usual [sense](dictionary.md#sense).[^22] As I hope to make clear, [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) is simply an essential, [irreducible](dictionary.md#irreducible) aspect of [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation).

Whether a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) is [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) is a matter not of logical relations but of personal relations. [Second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) [structure](dictionary.md#structure) our relatings to one another. And I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that those connected to [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) and the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person) are what we are [committed](dictionary.md#commit) to whenever we relate to one another [second-personally](dictionary.md#second-personally) at all.

### **A Circle of Irreducibly [Second-Personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [Concepts](dictionary.md#concept)**

[Second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) are invariably tied to a distinctively [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) *[practical](dictionary.md#practical) [authority](dictionary.md#authority):* the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to make a [demand](dictionary.md#demand) or [claim](dictionary.md#claim).[^23] Making a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or a [demand](dictionary.md#demand) as [valid](dictionary.md#valid) always presupposes the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to make it and that the duly authorized [claim](dictionary.md#claim) creates a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance) (a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason)). Moreover, these [notions](dictionary.md#notion) all also involve the idea of [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) or [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability). The [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) implies not just a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for the [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) to [comply](dictionary.md#comply), but also his being [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) for doing so.[^24] Conversely, [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) implies the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to hold [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable), which implies the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand), which is the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [address](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). These [notions](dictionary.md#notion)—[second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority), [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand), [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason), and [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) to—therefore comprise an interdefinable circle; each implies all the rest. Moreover, I contend, there is no way to break into this circle from outside it. [Propositions](dictionary.md#proposition) formulated only with [normative](dictionary.md#normative) and [evaluative](dictionary.md#evaluative) [concepts](dictionary.md#concept) that are not already implicitly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) cannot adequately [ground](dictionary.md#ground) [propositions](dictionary.md#proposition) formulated with [concepts](dictionary.md#concept) within the circle.

For example, it is important in what [follows](dictionary.md#follow) that [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of this irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [kind](dictionary.md#kind) differs from, and cannot be [reduced](dictionary.md#reduce) to, [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of other sorts. [Consider](dictionary.md#consider) epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority), for example. Even if the ways in which we [respect](dictionary.md#respect) epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority) are frequently [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)—giving weight to someone's epistemic [claims](dictionary.md#claim) in [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) about what to [believe](dictionary.md#believe)—epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority) is not itself [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal); it is third-personal. It depends fundamentally on a [person's](dictionary.md#person) relations to [facts](dictionary.md#fact) and [evidence](dictionary.md#evidence) as they are anyway, not on her relations to other [rational](dictionary.md#rational) cognizers. Even in cases of testimony where we take someone's word for something, this [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) can be defeated by deficiencies of epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of the [ordinary](dictionary.md#ordinary) third-personal [kind](dictionary.md#kind). If we have [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to distrust her [beliefs](dictionary.md#belief) or [judgment](dictionary.md#judgment), we also have [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to reject her [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) epistemic [claims](dictionary.md#claim). Moreover, it is [possible](dictionary.md#possible) to [respect](dictionary.md#respect) epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority) entirely privately without any [form](dictionary.md#form) of acknowledgment to others as, for instance, when someone [acts](dictionary.md#act) on a credible stock tip he overhears while serving drinks in the boardroom.

The [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act), however, is fundamentally [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal). When a sergeant [orders](dictionary.md#order) her platoon to fall in, her charges normally take it that the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) she thereby gives them derives entirely from her [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) [demands](dictionary.md#demand) to them and their [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) to [comply](dictionary.md#comply). This is not a [standing](dictionary.md#standing), like that of an advisor, that she can acquire simply because of her [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to [discern](dictionary.md#discern) non-second-personal [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for her troops' conduct. That is the point of Hobbes's famous distinction between "command" and "counsel."[^25] The sergeant's [order](dictionary.md#order) [addresses](dictionary.md#address) a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that would not exist but for her [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) it through her command. Similarly, when you [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that someone move his foot from on top of yours, you [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) an irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [address](dictionary.md#address) this [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason).

This does not mean, of course, that a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) to the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) either [claims](dictionary.md#claim) or [demands](dictionary.md#demand) in general or of some specific sort [will](dictionary.md#will) not need [justifying](dictionary.md#justify), or that someone might not come to have some such [standing](dictionary.md#standing) at least partly [by virtue of](dictionary.md#by%20virtue%20of) her [knowledge](dictionary.md#knowledge) or [wisdom](dictionary.md#wisdom). The point remains that the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) itself neither is, nor simply [follows](dictionary.md#follow) from, any [form](dictionary.md#form) of third-personal or epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority). And I maintain that the only way any such [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [standing](dictionary.md#standing) can be [justified](dictionary.md#justified) is within the circle of four interrelated ideas of [claim](dictionary.md#claim), [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability), [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason), and the species of [authority](dictionary.md#authority) that is related to these. Ultimately, I [claim](dictionary.md#claim), it must be justifiable from within a [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint.

There is thus an important difference between the idea of an [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) or binding [norm](dictionary.md#norm) in the familiar [sense](dictionary.md#sense) of a [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [ought](dictionary.md#ought) that [entails](dictionary.md#entail) genuine [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), on the one hand, and that of an [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) on the other. A central [claim](dictionary.md#claim) of this book, for instance, is that what is called the [inviolable](dictionary.md#inviolable) [value](dictionary.md#value) or *[dignity](dictionary.md#dignity)* of [persons](dictionary.md#person) has an irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) element, which includes the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [treatment](dictionary.md#treatment) of each other, like not stepping on one another's feet. To be sure, [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) partly involves there being ways one must conduct oneself toward [persons](dictionary.md#person) and ways one must not, that, as it is sometimes put, [persons](dictionary.md#person) are beings who may not be [treated](dictionary.md#treat) in [certain](dictionary.md#certain) ways (Kamm 1989, 1992; Nagel 1995). But that is only part of it, since there can be requirements on us that no one has any [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to require of us. We are under a requirement of [reason](dictionary.md#reason), for example, not to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) [propositions](dictionary.md#proposition) that contradict the logical [consequences](dictionary.md#consequence) of [known](dictionary.md#know) [premises](dictionary.md#premise). But it is only in [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [contexts](dictionary.md#context), say, when you and I are trying to work out what to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) together, that we have any [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that we each [reason](dictionary.md#reason) logically, and even here that [authority](dictionary.md#authority) apparently derives from a [moral](dictionary.md#moral) or quasi-moral aspect: our having undertaken a [common](dictionary.md#common) aim.[^26] Requirements of logical [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) are, in this way, fundamentally [different](dictionary.md#different) from those that are [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in the [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person)—and [different](dictionary.md#different) also from [moral](dictionary.md#moral) requirements more generally. I [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that it is part of the very [concept](dictionary.md#concept) that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are what those to whom we are morally [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that we do. Clearly this is no part whatsoever of the [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of a [demand](dictionary.md#demand) of logic or a requirement of [reason](dictionary.md#reason).[^27]

Our [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) as [persons](dictionary.md#person) includes, I maintain, an irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [respect](dictionary.md#respect) for this very [authority](dictionary.md#authority) and for the requirements with which it gives us the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance). [Dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) is not just a set of requirements with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to [persons](dictionary.md#person); it is also the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) [persons](dictionary.md#person) have to require [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance) with these requirements by holding one another [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) for doing so. Someone might [accept](dictionary.md#accept) the [first-order](dictionary.md#first-order) [norms](dictionary.md#norm) that [structure](dictionary.md#structure) the [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person) and [regulate](dictionary.md#regulate) himself scrupulously by them without [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) anyone's [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that he do so. He might even [accept](dictionary.md#accept) these as [mandatory](dictionary.md#mandatory) [norms](dictionary.md#norm) in some suitable [sense](dictionary.md#sense) without [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) anyone's [claim](dictionary.md#claim) to his [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance). I [claim](dictionary.md#claim), however, that he would not yet fully acknowledge the [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person) or [respect](dictionary.md#respect) [persons](dictionary.md#person) for their [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity). These involve an irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) dimension.

There is hence a general difference between there being [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of whatever weight or [priority](dictionary.md#priority) for us to do something—its being what we [ought](dictionary.md#ought) to or must do—and anyone's having any [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that we do it.[^28] If, say, [God](dictionary.md#god) has the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that we [comply](dictionary.md#comply) with [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [norms](dictionary.md#norm), his [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) this cannot be [reduced](dictionary.md#reduce) to any [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that the [norms](dictionary.md#norm) might themselves generate or [entail](dictionary.md#entail), nor, indeed, to his [knowledge](dictionary.md#knowledge) of these.[^29]

### **Strawson's Point**

We can see the same underlying idea from a [different](dictionary.md#different) direction by [considering](dictionary.md#consider) P. F. Strawson's influential critique of consequentialist approaches to [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) in "[Freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) and [Resentment](dictionary.md#resentment)" (1968). Against [accounts](dictionary.md#account) that seek to [justify](dictionary.md#justify) [practices](dictionary.md#practice) of [punishment](dictionary.md#punishment) and [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) by their "efficacy . . . in [regulating](dictionary.md#regulate) [behaviour](dictionary.md#behaviour) in socially desirable ways," Strawson [argued](dictionary.md#argue) that social desirability is not a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of "the [right](dictionary.md#right) *sort*" for [practices](dictionary.md#practice) of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) "as we [understand](dictionary.md#understand) them" (72, 74). When we seek to hold [people](dictionary.md#people) [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable), what matters is not whether doing so is desirable, either in a [particular](dictionary.md#particular) case or in general, but whether the [person's](dictionary.md#person) conduct is [culpable](dictionary.md#culpable) and we have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to bring him to [account](dictionary.md#account). *Desirability is a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind](dictionary.md#kind) to warrant the [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) and [actions](dictionary.md#action) in which holding someone [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) consists in their own terms.*

We can call this *Strawson's Point.* We find essentially the same idea in Dewey. "There is an [intrinsic](dictionary.md#intrinsic) difference," Dewey writes, "in both origin and mode of [operation](dictionary.md#operation) between [objects](dictionary.md#object) which present themselves as satisfactory to [desire](dictionary.md#desire) and hence [good](dictionary.md#good), and [objects](dictionary.md#object) which come to one as making [demands](dictionary.md#demand) upon his conduct which should be [recognized](dictionary.md#recognize). Neither can be [reduced](dictionary.md#reduce) to the other." And lest we think that Dewey might not mean anything essentially [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) by "[demands](dictionary.md#demand)," Dewey adds in a footnote: "Men who live together inevitably make [demands](dictionary.md#demand) on one another" (1998b: 319).[^30] So we might call this Dewey's Point as well.

Strawson's Point illustrates a more general [phenomenon](dictionary.md#phenomenon) that can be dubbed the *[wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) problem.* For example, there might be [pragmatic](dictionary.md#pragmatic) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) some [proposition](dictionary.md#proposition), but that doesn't make that [proposition](dictionary.md#proposition) credible (Shah 2003). It doesn't [justify](dictionary.md#justify) [believing](dictionary.md#believe) it in terms of [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) and standards that distinctively [apply](dictionary.md#apply) to [belief](dictionary.md#belief). Similarly, as D'Arms and Jacobson have pointed out, it is a "moralistic fallacy" to [conclude](dictionary.md#conclude) from the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that it would be morally objectionable to be amused by a [certain](dictionary.md#certain) joke that the joke is not funny.[^31] The former is a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the "[wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind](dictionary.md#kind)" to [justify](dictionary.md#justify) the [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that a joke does not warrant amusement in the relevant [sense](dictionary.md#sense) (D'Arms and Jacobson 2000a).

To be a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the [right](dictionary.md#right) [kind](dictionary.md#kind), a [consideration](dictionary.md#consideration) must [justify](dictionary.md#justify) the relevant [attitude](dictionary.md#attitude) in its own terms. It must be a [fact](dictionary.md#fact) about or feature of some [object](dictionary.md#object), [appropriate](dictionary.md#appropriate) [consideration](dictionary.md#consideration) of which could provide *someone's [reason](dictionary.md#reason)* for a warranted [attitude](dictionary.md#attitude) of that [kind](dictionary.md#kind) toward it.[^32] It must be something on the basis of which someone could (and appropriately would) come to hold the [attitude](dictionary.md#attitude) as a [conclusion](dictionary.md#conclusion) of a process of [considering](dictionary.md#consider) (deliberating about) whether to do so. In [considering](dictionary.md#consider) whether to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) some [proposition](dictionary.md#proposition) *p,* for example, it is simply impossible to [conclude](dictionary.md#conclude) one's deliberation in a [belief](dictionary.md#belief) that *p* by reflecting on the desirable [consequences](dictionary.md#consequence) of [believing](dictionary.md#believe) *p.* That is a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the [right](dictionary.md#right) [kind](dictionary.md#kind) for [desiring](dictionary.md#desire) to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) that *p,* but not for [believing](dictionary.md#believe) that *p* (as is shown by the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that one can come to [desire](dictionary.md#desire) to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) *p* by reflecting on the desirable [consequences](dictionary.md#consequence) of [believing](dictionary.md#believe) *p*). The *desirable* concerns [norms](dictionary.md#norm) and [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that are specific to [desire](dictionary.md#desire), and the *credible* concerns [norms](dictionary.md#norm) and [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) that are specific to [belief](dictionary.md#belief).

Similarly, the *[responsible](dictionary.md#responsible)* and the *[culpable](dictionary.md#culpable)* concern [norms](dictionary.md#norm) for the [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) and [actions](dictionary.md#action) that are involved in holding [people](dictionary.md#people) [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) and [blaming](dictionary.md#blame) them. The desirability—whether [moral](dictionary.md#moral), social, personal, or otherwise—of holding them [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), or [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) why that would be desirable, are simply [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of the [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind](dictionary.md#kind) to warrant doing so in the [sense](dictionary.md#sense) that is relevant to whether they are [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) or [blameworthy](dictionary.md#blameworthy).[^33] The former concerns [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) and [norms](dictionary.md#norm) of [desire](dictionary.md#desire), and what is thus desirable, even from the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) point of view, is simply a [different](dictionary.md#different) question from what we are [justified](dictionary.md#justified) in holding someone [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) or [blaming](dictionary.md#blame) them for in the relevant [sense](dictionary.md#sense).

Strawson dubbed the [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) involved in holding [people](dictionary.md#people) [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) "[reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude)," with prominent examples being [indignation](dictionary.md#indignation), [resentment](dictionary.md#resentment), [guilt](dictionary.md#guilt), [blame](dictionary.md#blame), and so on. And Strawson pointed out what commentators have since stressed, namely, that [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) implicitly [address](dictionary.md#address) [demands](dictionary.md#demand). They invariably involve "an expectation of, and [demand](dictionary.md#demand) for" [certain](dictionary.md#certain) conduct from one another (1968: 85).[^34] [Reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) invariably concern what someone can be held to, so they invariably [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to hold someone [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) and make [demands](dictionary.md#demand) of him. [Moral](dictionary.md#moral) [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) therefore [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) and hold one another [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) for [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance) with [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s (which just are the standards to which we can warrantedly hold each other as [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community). But they also [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) that those we hold [accountable](dictionary.md#accountable) have that [standing](dictionary.md#standing) also. They [address](dictionary.md#address) another, Strawson says, in a way that "continu[es] to view him as a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community; only as one who has [offended](dictionary.md#offend) against its [demands](dictionary.md#demand)" (93). It [follows](dictionary.md#follow) that [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) are [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) in our [sense](dictionary.md#sense), and that [ethical](dictionary.md#ethical) [notions](dictionary.md#notion) that are distinctively relevant to these [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude)—the [culpable](dictionary.md#culpable), [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility), and, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)—all have an irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) aspect that ties them conceptually to [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons).

### **[Rights](dictionary.md#right)**

Another central [ethical](dictionary.md#ethical) [concept](dictionary.md#concept) within the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) circle is that of a *[right](dictionary.md#right),* most obviously, of a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) [right](dictionary.md#right). You might think, for instance, that non-inadvertent stepping on your feet violates a [right](dictionary.md#right) you have against other [persons](dictionary.md#person). If so, then what you think is not just that others should, or even must, take care not to step on your feet. The holding of even [mandatory](dictionary.md#mandatory) [norms](dictionary.md#norm) does not amount to the [existence](dictionary.md#existence) of a [right](dictionary.md#right). As Feinberg stressed, to have a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) [right](dictionary.md#right) is to have someplace to "stand," if you [will](dictionary.md#will) [permit](dictionary.md#permit) the [metaphor](dictionary.md#metaphor) in this [context](dictionary.md#context), to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that to which one has the [right](dictionary.md#right). It includes a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to resist, complain, remonstrate, and perhaps [use](dictionary.md#use) [coercive](dictionary.md#coercive) [measures](dictionary.md#measure) of other [kinds](dictionary.md#kind), including, perhaps, to gain compensation if the [right](dictionary.md#right) is [violated](dictionary.md#violate).[^35] In addition to there being weighty [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) against others stepping on your feet, indeed, in addition to [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community having the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that [people](dictionary.md#people) not step on your feet, if you have a [right](dictionary.md#right), then you have a [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to make a special [demand](dictionary.md#demand) against [people](dictionary.md#people) who might step on your feet—you have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to resist, [claim](dictionary.md#claim) compensation, and so on.

This is [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) in Hohfeld's famous [formulation](dictionary.md#formulation) (1923).[^36] According to Hohfeld, someone has a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) [right](dictionary.md#right) to another [person's](dictionary.md#person) doing something *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* that [person](dictionary.md#person) has an [obligation](dictionary.md#obligation) to her to do that thing.[^37] And this consists not simply in its being [the case](dictionary.md#the%20case) that the other [ought](dictionary.md#ought) or has [good](dictionary.md#good) and [sufficient](dictionary.md#sufficient) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to do it, even that the [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for him to do it are [exclusionary](dictionary.md#exclusionary) in Raz's [sense](dictionary.md#sense) of not being appropriately weighed against otherwise competing [considerations](dictionary.md#consideration) (1975), but in the claimholder's [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance) and, perhaps, compensation for non-compliance.[^38] [Rights](dictionary.md#right) are thus associated conceptually with [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). There may of course be non-second-personal [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for others to do what we also have a [right](dictionary.md#right) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) their doing, but the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) that is distinctively associated with the [right](dictionary.md#right) is [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal). It simply wouldn't exist but for the [possibility](dictionary.md#possibility) of its being [addressed](dictionary.md#address) in invokings of the [right](dictionary.md#right).

[Rights](dictionary.md#right) of other [kinds](dictionary.md#kind) are [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) as well, if less obviously. If the [person](dictionary.md#person) who stepped on your foot were within his [rights](dictionary.md#right) or morally [free](dictionary.md#free) to have done so (had a [Hohfeldian](dictionary.md#hohfeldian) "[liberty](dictionary.md#liberty)"), then neither you nor anyone else would have had any [standing](dictionary.md#standing) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) otherwise or complain. In his famous "Are There Any [Natural](dictionary.md#natural) [Rights](dictionary.md#right)," Hart argues, [following](dictionary.md#follow) a venerable tradition running through Fichte and Kant, that the idea of [rights](dictionary.md#right) is conceptually connected to there being a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [justification](dictionary.md#justification) for restricting [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom).[^39] The central element of this conceptual area, Hart writes, is there being "no incongruity, but a special congruity in the [use](dictionary.md#use) of force or the threat of force to secure what is just or fair or someone's [right](dictionary.md#right)" (1965: 178). It is important in what [follows](dictionary.md#follow) that the relevant "congruity" cannot be fully captured in non-second-personal terms.[^40] This is an aspect of Strawson's Point, and it connects with deeply related ideas of Pufendorf and Fichte that I [will](dictionary.md#will) set out presently. A [justification](dictionary.md#justification) "of the [right](dictionary.md#right) sort" for imposing upon another's [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) and directing his [will](dictionary.md#will) exists *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* one has the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to make a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) on his [will](dictionary.md#will) (and if no one, including the [person](dictionary.md#person) herself, has the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to complain or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) otherwise). Otherwise, an imposition of [will](dictionary.md#will) is [coercion](dictionary.md#coercion) pure and simple.

Now we are concerned less directly with [rights](dictionary.md#right) than with *[moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation).* As Hart himself notes, however, despite the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that '[moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)' can sometimes be [used](dictionary.md#use) as a "general label" for what "morally we [ought](dictionary.md#ought) to do," the [concept](dictionary.md#concept) has a more properly restricted content that is intimately connected with that of [rights](dictionary.md#right) (1965: 178).[^41] Neither [concept](dictionary.md#concept) can be understood independently of the idea of the ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand). Just as a [right](dictionary.md#right) involves an [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that to which one has a [right](dictionary.md#right), so also is [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) conceptually tied to what the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community can [demand](dictionary.md#demand) (and what no one has a [right](dictionary.md#right) not to do). And what I am morally [free](dictionary.md#free) to do is what no one can justifiably [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that I not do either as a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community (no conflicting [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)) or as an [individual](dictionary.md#individual) (no conflicting [right](dictionary.md#right)).

### **The [Presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of [Second-Personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [Address](dictionary.md#address)**

[Addressing](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of any [kind](dictionary.md#kind), I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), always carries [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) concerning the [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority), competence, and [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) of [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) alike. I shall be focusing on pure cases of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) and reason-giving, abstracting from manipulation, cajoling, or any other [form](dictionary.md#form) of nonrational influence (alternatively, on actual cases, *qua* [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address)). In a pure case, an [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) attempts to give an [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) that is [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in [normative](dictionary.md#normative) relations that, as I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), he presupposes the [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) can be expected to [accept](dictionary.md#accept). What is built into this [presupposition](dictionary.md#presupposition)? Quite a lot.

### **Fichte's Point**

The post-Kantian German idealist Johann Gottlieb Fichte claimed that pure [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) always presumes to direct an [agent's](dictionary.md#agent) [will](dictionary.md#will) through the [agent's](dictionary.md#agent) own self-determining choice. Only in this way, Fichte argues, can it simultaneously [address](dictionary.md#address) and direct her as a [free](dictionary.md#free) [agent](dictionary.md#agent). Call this *Fichte's Analysis* of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address). I defend Fichte's Analysis and followFichte further in [arguing](dictionary.md#argue) that Fichte's Analysis supports *Fichte's Point,* namely, that any [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or "summons" *(Aufforderung)* presupposes a [common](dictionary.md#common) competence, [authority](dictionary.md#authority), and, therefore, [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) as [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational), a [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) second-personality that [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) share and that is appropriately [recognized](dictionary.md#recognize) reciprocally (Fichte 2000). The terms of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) [commit](dictionary.md#commit) both parties to seeing each other as, in Rawls's famous [formulation](dictionary.md#formulation), "selforiginating [source](dictionary.md#source)[s] of [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [claims](dictionary.md#claim)" (1980: 546). Whatever more specific difference-defining [authorities](dictionary.md#authority) they [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose), each is [committed](dictionary.md#commit) also to [assuming](dictionary.md#assume) that [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [persons](dictionary.md#person) have a [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) or [authority](dictionary.md#authority) in [common](dictionary.md#common) to [address](dictionary.md#address) (and be [addressed](dictionary.md#address)) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons).[^42] And each must also [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) their [common](dictionary.md#common) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) *competence,* a [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) to [determine](dictionary.md#determine) themselves by these [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), which [capacity](dictionary.md#capacity) includes [motivation](dictionary.md#motivation) that, because the [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) are irreducibly [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal), cannot be [reduced](dictionary.md#reduce) to [desires](dictionary.md#desire) for any [outcome](dictionary.md#outcome).[^43]

There is thus, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), a [form](dictionary.md#form) of reciprocal [respect](dictionary.md#respect) that is built into all [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) reason-giving, even when the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) relations it explicitly presupposes are at odds with the full [equality](dictionary.md#equality) we now [believe](dictionary.md#believe) to characterize the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) point of view. Any pure case of [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) or [demanding](dictionary.md#demand) presupposes the [standing](dictionary.md#standing) [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) to enter into [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) at all. Specifically, it presupposes a distinction between [legitimate](dictionary.md#legitimate) [forms](dictionary.md#form) of [address](dictionary.md#address) that, as Fichte puts it, "summon" [persons](dictionary.md#person) to [determine](dictionary.md#determine) themselves freely by [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) (however [hierarchical](dictionary.md#hierarchical)), on the one hand, and [coercion](dictionary.md#coercion), that is, impermissible ways of simply causing wanted [behavior](dictionary.md#behavior) that "depriv[e the [agent](dictionary.md#agent)] of its [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to [act](dictionary.md#act) freely," on the other (Fichte 2000: 41).[^44] This [means](dictionary.md#means) that whenever [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) asserts or presupposes differential [authority](dictionary.md#authority), it must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) also that this [authority](dictionary.md#authority) is acceptable to its [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) simply as a [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agent](dictionary.md#agent).

Fichte [realized](dictionary.md#realize) the [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) significance of his point for the philosophy of [right](dictionary.md#right), and so made it part of a "[Deduction](dictionary.md#deduction) of the [Concept](dictionary.md#concept) of [Right](dictionary.md#right)" at the outset of his *[Foundations](dictionary.md#foundation) of [Natural](dictionary.md#natural) [Right](dictionary.md#right).*[^45] If a [right](dictionary.md#right), by its very [nature](dictionary.md#nature), involves the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand), so also, Fichte argues, does [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) both the competence and the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) alike freely to [determine](dictionary.md#determine) themselves by [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), that is, [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) whose [validity](dictionary.md#validity) itself depends on that very [authority](dictionary.md#authority) and their [ability](dictionary.md#ability) freely to [determine](dictionary.md#determine) themselves by acknowledging it. And this, he argues, commits [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and acknowledging [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) to [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) a [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) [principle](dictionary.md#principle) of [right](dictionary.md#right): "I must in all cases [recognize](dictionary.md#recognize) the [free](dictionary.md#free) being outside me as a [free](dictionary.md#free) being, i.e., I must limit my [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) through the [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of the [possibility](dictionary.md#possibility) of his [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom)" (2000: 49). The very distinction between [coercion](dictionary.md#coercion), that is, attempting to direct someone's [will](dictionary.md#will) without [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) he can be expected to [accept](dictionary.md#accept), on the one hand, and making a [directive](dictionary.md#directive) [claim](dictionary.md#claim) on someone's [will](dictionary.md#will) backed by [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority), on the other, itself presupposes that [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) share a [common](dictionary.md#common) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) as [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational), which they reciprocally [recognize](dictionary.md#recognize) in the [address](dictionary.md#address) and uptake of an *Aufforderung.*

Fichte connects this insight, also correctly in my view, to a [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) difference between theoretical and [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [reason](dictionary.md#reason). [Second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) both makes [possible](dictionary.md#possible) and simultaneously makes us [aware](dictionary.md#aware) of a species of [practical](dictionary.md#practical) [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) that lacks any analogue in the theoretical realm. I develop and defend this [claim](dictionary.md#claim), relating it to Kant's [notion](dictionary.md#notion) of [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will). It turns out, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), that Fichte's Point is exactly what is needed to work out properly the central Kantian ideas of the [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [persons](dictionary.md#person) and [autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will).

### **Pufendorf 's Point**

A final piece of the puzzle that is needed, along with Fichte's Analysis to [establish](dictionary.md#establish) Fichte's Point, is an idea that Samuel Pufendorf advanced in the course of defending a theological voluntarist [theory](dictionary.md#theory) of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) lawin the seventeenth century. According to Pufendorf, [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)'s connection to [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) is [explained](dictionary.md#explain) by the [fact](dictionary.md#fact) that the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) lawderives from [God's](dictionary.md#god) commands. [Moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s are all ultimately [owed](dictionary.md#owe) to [God](dictionary.md#god). But Pufendorf also thought that [obligations](dictionary.md#obligation) can arise in this way *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* [God](dictionary.md#god) [addresses](dictionary.md#address) us as [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agents](dictionary.md#agent) and if we and he [understand](dictionary.md#understand) this [address](dictionary.md#address) in a [certain](dictionary.md#certain) way. *Pufendorf 's Point* was that genuine [obligations](dictionary.md#obligation) can result only from an [address](dictionary.md#address) that presupposes an [addressee's](dictionary.md#addressee) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence.[^46] To intelligibly hold someone [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), we must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) that she can hold herself [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible) in her own [reasoning](dictionary.md#reasoning) and thought.[^47] And to do that, she must be able to take up a [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint on herself and make and acknowledge [demands](dictionary.md#demand) of herself from that point of view. For [God](dictionary.md#god) to be able to [obligate](dictionary.md#obligate) us by his command, consequently, [God](dictionary.md#god) (and we) must [assume](dictionary.md#assume) that we can be moved not simply by a fear of [sanctions](dictionary.md#sanctions) that might coerce [compliance](dictionary.md#compliance), but by "acknowledg[ing] of [ourselves] that the evil, which has been pointed out to the [person](dictionary.md#person) who deviates from an announced [rule](dictionary.md#rule), falls upon him justly" (Pufendorf 1934: 91). This is the difference between a [kind of](dictionary.md#kind%20of) [coercion](dictionary.md#coercion), on the one hand, and [free](dictionary.md#free) [self-determination](dictionary.md#self-determination) by an [internal](dictionary.md#internal) [acceptance](dictionary.md#acceptance) of an [authoritative](dictionary.md#authoritative) [demand](dictionary.md#demand), on the other. To be [obligated](dictionary.md#obligate) by [God's](dictionary.md#god) command, we must be able to take a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) standpoint on ourselves and be motivated by internally [addressed](dictionary.md#address) [demands](dictionary.md#demand) whose ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) we ourselves [accept](dictionary.md#accept).

Properly appreciating Strawson's, Fichte's, and Pufendorf 's Points together [will](dictionary.md#will) enable us to see why any [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) whatsoever presupposes a [common](dictionary.md#common) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) competence, [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility), and [authority](dictionary.md#authority) that [addresser](dictionary.md#addresser) and [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) share as [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [agents](dictionary.md#agent). It is [assuming](dictionary.md#assume) a [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint that gets us inside the circle of interdefinable [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [notions](dictionary.md#notion) and that commits us, moreover, to the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [dignity](dictionary.md#dignity) of [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [persons](dictionary.md#person). Substantially the same point can be put in Rawlsian terms by saying that it is [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) that gets us into the space of "public [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" and the "[reasonable](dictionary.md#reasonable)" rather than the (merely) individually "[rational](dictionary.md#rational)" (Rawls 1980, 1993). Any such [address](dictionary.md#address) unavoidably presupposes that its [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) can [accept](dictionary.md#accept) as [reasonable](dictionary.md#reasonable) both the [claims](dictionary.md#claim) it [addresses](dictionary.md#address) and the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) on which these [claims](dictionary.md#claim) are based, and it consequently assumes relations of reciprocal [respect](dictionary.md#respect) and [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability), which are mediated by public [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) and a [conception](dictionary.md#conception) of the [reasonable](dictionary.md#reasonable).

It is entirely [possible](dictionary.md#possible) to give [people](dictionary.md#people) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) for [acting](dictionary.md#act) that are not [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal), however, without [assuming](dictionary.md#assume) any [common](dictionary.md#common) competence and [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [address](dictionary.md#address) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to one another. If, say, [God](dictionary.md#god) can get us to see the risks of hellfire, he [will](dictionary.md#will) have given us a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) not to sin regardless of any [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) he or we might have or lack. Neither need he [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) that we can be expected reasonably to [accept](dictionary.md#accept) anything. In other words, whether we are "[reasonable](dictionary.md#reasonable)" in any [sense](dictionary.md#sense) that is relevant here [will](dictionary.md#will) simply [follow](dictionary.md#follow) from whether we can see and be moved by the relevant [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). Similarly, you can get someone to see that you are in pain, that it is a [bad](dictionary.md#bad) thing that you are, and consequently that there is [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for anyone who can to alter this [bad](dictionary.md#bad) state without that raising any [issue](dictionary.md#issue) of your [authorities](dictionary.md#authority) with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to each other. When, however, we [address](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), the [existence](dictionary.md#existence) of the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) itself depends upon whether its [addressees](dictionary.md#addressee) can reasonably [accept](dictionary.md#accept) the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) relation from which it ostensibly flows. This is a [consequence](dictionary.md#consequence) of Fichte's Point. And it is why a contractualist framework like Rawls's or Scanlon's must ultimately tie "what we [owe](dictionary.md#owe) to each other," that is, what we can authoritatively [demand](dictionary.md#demand) from one another, to [mutual](dictionary.md#mutual) [respect](dictionary.md#respect) and a [test](dictionary.md#test) of [reasonable](dictionary.md#reasonable) [agreement](dictionary.md#agreement) (Scanlon 1998). I [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that it is the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) we [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) from the [second-person](dictionary.md#second-person) standpoint that most deeply underlies contractualism.

I should make clear that I do not [claim](dictionary.md#claim) in any of this that participants in [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) interaction invariably do [accept](dictionary.md#accept) or are [aware](dictionary.md#aware) of these [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition), or even that the [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) [assumptions](dictionary.md#assumption) must be accessible to them.[^48] The idea of [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community between [free](dictionary.md#free) and [rational](dictionary.md#rational) [persons](dictionary.md#person) is a significant achievement of relatively recent [human](dictionary.md#human) history, and there is no [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to think that it was even available, say, to an ancient Hittite [issuing](dictionary.md#issue) an [order](dictionary.md#order) or making a request. Pufendorf himself would no doubt have rejected what I am [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) he is [committed](dictionary.md#commit) to by the distinctions he made. My [thesis](dictionary.md#thesis) is that the [assumptions](dictionary.md#assumption) I [identify](dictionary.md#identify) are [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) in the [sense](dictionary.md#sense) that ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) can be validly [addressed](dictionary.md#address) *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* these [assumptions](dictionary.md#assumption) hold.

They are "[normative](dictionary.md#normative) [felicity conditions](dictionary.md#felicity%20conditions)" of the (pure) [address](dictionary.md#address) of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) in general.

Indeed, the very distinction between a pure case of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) reason-giving and nonrational [forms](dictionary.md#form) of influence—or the [abstraction](dictionary.md#abstraction): *qua* [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address)—is no doubt itself relatively recent. When I say that [addressing](dictionary.md#address) [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) carries [certain](dictionary.md#certain) [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition), I should be understood as talking about the pure case, which, along with its [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition), only comes clearly into view retrospectively (although from this latter perspective, the [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) [will](dictionary.md#will) seem to have always been [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit)).[^49] My [claim](dictionary.md#claim) is that a [common](dictionary.md#common) second-personality is a [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) [condition](dictionary.md#condition) of the success of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) in its own terms, that is, for the relevant [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) actually to exist and be given.

As an [analogy](dictionary.md#analogy), [consider](dictionary.md#consider) the familiar [thesis](dictionary.md#thesis) that [punishment](dictionary.md#punishment) can be fully [justified](dictionary.md#justified) only on an [assumption](dictionary.md#assumption) of [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) of the [will](dictionary.md#will). There is probably no [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to think that this latter idea, at least in its [modern](dictionary.md#modern) [form](dictionary.md#form), was available to the ancient Hittites either, but they surely had [punishment](dictionary.md#punishment) of a sort.[^50] No doubt their [practices](dictionary.md#practice) [differed](dictionary.md#differ) in various ways from what we would [consider](dictionary.md#consider) [punishment](dictionary.md#punishment) as a pure case. But that is just the point. [Freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) can plausibly seem a [presupposition](dictionary.md#presupposition) of [punishment](dictionary.md#punishment) in the pure case (in its own terms) as we now distinguish it. And similar things, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), are [true](dictionary.md#true) of the pure [address](dictionary.md#address) of [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) in general.

[^1]: My terminology derives, of course, from the grammatical second [person](dictionary.md#person). It thus differs from, although it is not totally unrelated to, the [use](dictionary.md#use) in Davidson 2001. More closely related is the genus of [addressed](dictionary.md#address) thought and [speech](dictionary.md#speech). But there are [forms](dictionary.md#form) of [addressed](dictionary.md#address) thought that do not seem to involve [claim](dictionary.md#claim) making.

[^3]: Throughout, except where [context](dictionary.md#context) makes clear, I [will](dictionary.md#will) be [referring](dictionary.md#refer) to *[normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons)* rather than *motivating [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons),* that is, to [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) *to* do something, rather than whatever [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) someone actually [acts](dictionary.md#act) on or any motivational state that explains one's [act](dictionary.md#act) causally or teleologically. And I [will](dictionary.md#will) [follow](dictionary.md#follow) [ordinary](dictionary.md#ordinary) usage, according to which "give someone a [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" is a "success" phrase: X gives Y a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) to do A *[only-if](dictionary.md#only-if)* there is a [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) for X to do A.

[^4]: I [will](dictionary.md#will) frequently [use](dictionary.md#use) "[address](dictionary.md#address) a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" as short for "purports to give an [addressee](dictionary.md#addressee) a ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) by [addressing](dictionary.md#address) a [demand](dictionary.md#demand) or [claim](dictionary.md#claim)." Strictly, it is the [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) that is [addressed](dictionary.md#address). As I shall [use](dictionary.md#use) the phrases, "[addresses](dictionary.md#address) a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand)" and, consequently, "[addresses](dictionary.md#address) a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [reason](dictionary.md#reason)" are not success phrases. Although if X [addresses](dictionary.md#address) a [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) to Y, X assumes or presupposes the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to make the [claim](dictionary.md#claim) or [demand](dictionary.md#demand) of Y, X may lack this [authority](dictionary.md#authority). In this case, although X purports to give Y a [reason](dictionary.md#reason) rooted in his [claim](dictionary.md#claim) (and so, in my terms, "[addresses](dictionary.md#address) the [reason](dictionary.md#reason)"), no [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [reason](dictionary.md#reason) is actually given. I am grateful to Mark Schroeder for pressing me to clarify these points.

"Let us suppose such a [person](dictionary.md#person) ever so selfish; let private [interest](dictionary.md#interest) have ingrossed ever so much his [attention](dictionary.md#attention); yet in instances, where that is not concerned, he must unavoidably feel *some* propensity to the [good](dictionary.md#good) of mankind, and make it an [object](dictionary.md#object) of choice, if every thing else be [equal](dictionary.md#equal)" (Hume 1985: 225).

[^9]: Agent-neutral [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) [contrast](dictionary.md#contrast) with agent-relative [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), whose [formulation](dictionary.md#formulation) includes an ineliminable [reference](dictionary.md#reference) to the [agent](dictionary.md#agent) for whom they are [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) (like "that it [will](dictionary.md#will) keep a [promise](dictionary.md#promise) I made," "that it [will](dictionary.md#will) avoid [harm](dictionary.md#harm) to others [i.e., [people](dictionary.md#people) other than me]" and so on). Agent-neutral [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) can be stated without such a [reference](dictionary.md#reference): "that it would prevent some pain from [occurring](dictionary.md#occur) to someone (or some being)." On the distinction between agent-relative (also called "[subjective](dictionary.md#subjective)" or "agent-centered") and agent-neutral (also called "objective") [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons), [principles](dictionary.md#principle), [values](dictionary.md#value), and so forth, see Darwall 1986a; McNaughton and Rawling 1991; Nagel 1970, 1986; Parfit 1984; and Scheffler 1982. For a [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) that raises a question about the [value](dictionary.md#value) of this distinction, see Korsgaard 1996d.<br>I [argue for](dictionary.md#argue%20for) the [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that sympathetic concern involves there seeming to be agentneutral [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to further someone's welfare in Darwall 2002b: 68–72. I do not [deny](dictionary.md#deny), of course, that someone who already accepted various agent-relative [norms](dictionary.md#norm) might not be moved through empathy and [sympathy](dictionary.md#sympathy) to feel some special [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) for relieving the pain. My point is that this would not come through [sympathy](dictionary.md#sympathy) alone.<br>Note also that there is an important difference between [sympathy](dictionary.md#sympathy) and empathy here. I am indebted to Nir Eyal for the [following](dictionary.md#follow): "A beggar looks at passers-by in the eye, and lets them see his obviously painful wound, which clearly requires [treatment](dictionary.md#treatment). He continues to look at them intently. His conduct may be read as a communication of something like 'Help me! You see I am in pain.' " Cases like this seem to be mixed, in my view, combining appeals to [sympathy](dictionary.md#sympathy) with [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) ([second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal)) [claims](dictionary.md#claim). To the extent that there is an appeal with a continued [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) engagement that takes the passer-by into the afflicted [person's](dictionary.md#person) perspective, what we have is the [address](dictionary.md#address) of a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [claim](dictionary.md#claim).

[^10]: Note that superficially agent-relative [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) may be [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) more deeply in agentneutral [considerations](dictionary.md#consideration) and [values](dictionary.md#value), and/or vice versa. For example, rule-utilitarianism holds that [rules](dictionary.md#rules) of [right](dictionary.md#right) conduct include agent-relative [principles](dictionary.md#principle), such as those [defining](dictionary.md#define) [rights](dictionary.md#right) of [promise](dictionary.md#promise) and contract, on [grounds](dictionary.md#ground) of overall agent-neutral [value](dictionary.md#value).
[^11]: Just as might be [the case](dictionary.md#the%20case) if you were trying to get him to see [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) to [believe](dictionary.md#believe) that you were in pain. A grimace might [suffice](dictionary.md#suffice) without your having to [presume](dictionary.md#presume) any [authority](dictionary.md#authority) on the question.
[^12]: See the [references](dictionary.md#reference) in note 9.

[^13]: A [test](dictionary.md#test) for whether a given [reason](dictionary.md#reason) or [principle](dictionary.md#principle) is agent-relative or agent-neutral is to [consider](dictionary.md#consider) a case where it recommends someone's doing something and augment [the case](dictionary.md#the%20case) by [stipulating](dictionary.md#stipulate) that, as it happens, were the [person](dictionary.md#person) not to [perform](dictionary.md#perform) that [action](dictionary.md#action) (described in the relevant [reason](dictionary.md#reason)- or principle-sensitive way), it would bring about one other [person's](dictionary.md#person) doing an [action](dictionary.md#action) of the very same [kind](dictionary.md#kind). If the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) is agent-neutral, then it should make no difference whether the [agent](dictionary.md#agent) performs the [act](dictionary.md#act) without the other [person's](dictionary.md#person) doing so or forbears the [performance](dictionary.md#performance), thereby bringing about the other's [performance](dictionary.md#performance). If it does make a difference, then the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) or [principle](dictionary.md#principle) is agent-relative. "Don't tread on me" and "Don't tread on other [persons](dictionary.md#person)" do not [reduce](dictionary.md#reduce) to "Bring it about that [people](dictionary.md#people) are not tread upon."

[^14]: Suppose he rejects your request, enjoying being able to keep you under foot. Now you have an even weightier [claim](dictionary.md#claim). For now he is not simply causing you gratuitous pain, he is making you the [object](dictionary.md#object) of his sadistic [pleasure](dictionary.md#pleasure). And however much trouble we can legitimately put [people](dictionary.md#people) through to ensure they not step on our feet, we can certainly put them through more to prevent their sadistically victimizing us. I am indebted here to [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) with Marshall Weinberg.
[^15]: There are, of course, ways of [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) [demands](dictionary.md#demand), say out of self-interest in a negotiation, that are [different](dictionary.md#different) from [accepting](dictionary.md#accept) something as a [valid](dictionary.md#valid) [demand](dictionary.md#demand).

[^16]: The [formulation](dictionary.md#formulation) of the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) may not always be agent-relative, however. Suppose, for example, that the best way of [grounding](dictionary.md#grounding) the [categorical imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) is, as I shall be [suggesting](dictionary.md#suggest), in an [authority](dictionary.md#authority) [persons](dictionary.md#person) [presuppose](dictionary.md#presuppose) when they [address](dictionary.md#address) one another [second-personally](dictionary.md#second-personally). It is at least conceivable that what the [categorical imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) itself requires is a [principle](dictionary.md#principle) of conduct that can be specified agent-neutrally. R. M. Hare, for example, [believes](dictionary.md#believe) that the [categorical imperative](dictionary.md#categorical%20imperative) can be seen to [entail](dictionary.md#entail) the sort of [universal](dictionary.md#universal) [prescriptivism](dictionary.md#prescriptivism) he favors and that this [entails](dictionary.md#entail) a [form](dictionary.md#form) of act-utilitarianism (an agent-neutral [theory](dictionary.md#theory)). See Hare 1993.

[^17]: This would be like Hart's [interpretation](dictionary.md#interpretation) of Bentham's [doctrine](dictionary.md#doctrine) in *A Fragment of Government* as involving "quasi-commands" rather than the [explicit](dictionary.md#explicit) commands of statute [law](dictionary.md#law). In such cases, Hart says, the command is taken to be [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) in [acts](dictionary.md#act) of punishing. I [will](dictionary.md#will) be saying the analogous thing about [moral](dictionary.md#moral) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability) (Hart 1990: 93–94). This analysis is the same as Strawson's on the [demand](dictionary.md#demand) [quality](dictionary.md#quality) of [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude), which I discuss under "Strawson's Point" below and in Chapter 4 (Strawson 1968). I am indebted to Rae Langton and others for pressing me on these points and to Rob Kar and Kevin Toh for [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of Hart's view.
[^18]: For the [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) point of viewis "[first-person](dictionary.md#first-person) [plural](dictionary.md#plural)," see Postema 1995. It is also a theme of Korsgaard's writings.

[^19]: They must be agent-relative, Nagel [believes](dictionary.md#believe), because they hold, for example, that it is [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) to [harm](dictionary.md#harm) someone oneself, even if that is [necessary](dictionary.md#necessary) to prevent exactly [equivalent](dictionary.md#equivalent) [harm](dictionary.md#harm) by someone else. I am indebted here to [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) with Chris Dodsworth.
[^20]: See note 9.
[^21]: However, Korsgaard also apparently [believes](dictionary.md#believe) that [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation)s can be [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in the constraints of [first-personal](dictionary.md#first-personal) deliberation alone. I [argue against](dictionary.md#argue%20against) this in Chapter 9.
[^22]: In Chapter 9, I discuss Korsgaard's deployment of Wittgenstein's private language [argument](dictionary.md#argument) in Korsgaard 1996e.
[^23]: See Joseph Raz's idea of a "[normative](dictionary.md#normative) [power](dictionary.md#power)" in Raz 1972. I am indebted to Gary Watson for this [reference](dictionary.md#reference).

[^24]: Thus, Michael Dummett remarks that the [right](dictionary.md#right) to command [entails](dictionary.md#entail) that "the *[right](dictionary.md#right)* to [reproach](dictionary.md#reproach) is an automatic [consequence](dictionary.md#consequence) of [disobedience](dictionary.md#disobedience)" (Dummett 1990: 9).
[^25]: "They who less seriously [consider](dictionary.md#consider) the force of words, do sometimes confound [law](dictionary.md#law) with *counsel*. . . . We must fetch the distinction between *counsel* and *[law](dictionary.md#law)*, from the difference between *counsel* and *command*. Now counsel is a *precept*, in which the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of my [obeying](dictionary.md#obey) it is taken from *the thing itself* which is advised; but command is a *precept,* in which the cause of my [obedience](dictionary.md#obedience) depends on the *[will](dictionary.md#will) of the commander*. For it is not properly said, *thus I [will](dictionary.md#will)* and *thus I command,* except the [will](dictionary.md#will) stand for a [reason](dictionary.md#reason). Now when [obedience](dictionary.md#obedience) is yielded to the [laws](dictionary.md#law), not for the thing itself, but by [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of the adviser's [will](dictionary.md#will), the [law](dictionary.md#law) is not a *counsel,* but a *command,* and is [defined](dictionary.md#define) thus: [law](dictionary.md#law) *is the command of that [person](dictionary.md#person) (whether man or [court](dictionary.md#court)) whose precept contains in it the [reason](dictionary.md#reason) of [obedience](dictionary.md#obedience):* as the precepts of [God](dictionary.md#god) in regard of men, of magistrates in [respect](dictionary.md#respect) of their [subjects](dictionary.md#subject), and universally of all the powerful in [respect](dictionary.md#respect) of them who cannot resist, may be termed their [laws](dictionary.md#law)" (Hobbes 1983: XIV.1; see also Hobbes 1994: XXV). In my view, failure to observe this distinction infects Joseph Raz's [account](dictionary.md#account) of [authority](dictionary.md#authority) in Raz 1986. See also note 29.

[^26]: Of course, these further constraints are frequently in the background, as they are, for example, whenever we do philosophy, say, [right](dictionary.md#right) now. Because of the relationship you and I are currently in, each of us does have [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to call the other to [account](dictionary.md#account) for logical errors, a [standing](dictionary.md#standing) that, without some such [context](dictionary.md#context), we lack. But however frequently that or some relevantly similar [context](dictionary.md#context) obtains, the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) comes not just from the requirement of [reason](dictionary.md#reason), but also from some other [presupposed](dictionary.md#presuppose) feature of the [context](dictionary.md#context).
[^27]: I am indebted to Peter Graham for this way of putting the [contrast](dictionary.md#contrast).
[^28]: Although not, of course, its being what we morally must do (are morally required to do), since this is what [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community have the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) we do.

[^29]: As I [mentioned](dictionary.md#mention) in note 25, Raz argues (1986) that the species of [authority](dictionary.md#authority) with which we are concerned, for example, political [authority](dictionary.md#authority), can be [grounded](dictionary.md#ground) in epistemic [authority](dictionary.md#authority). But as Nomy Arpaly has put it to me, "Just because I knowmore than you doesn't make me boss." Thomas Jefferson makes a similar point, when he says, "Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in [understanding](dictionary.md#understand), he was not therefore lord of the [person](dictionary.md#person) or [property](dictionary.md#property) of others" (Jefferson 1984: 1202). I am indebted to Charles Griswold for this [reference](dictionary.md#reference). Raz's viewdeserves a more careful [treatment](dictionary.md#treatment) than I can provide here, which I [intend](dictionary.md#intend) to provide on another [occasion](dictionary.md#occasion).
[^30]: I am indebted to Elizabeth Anderson for this [reference](dictionary.md#reference).

[^31]: D'Arms and Jacobson [argue](dictionary.md#argue) that this poses a problem for response-dependent or, as they call them, "neo-sentimentalist" [accounts](dictionary.md#account) of various [evaluative](dictionary.md#evaluative) and [normative](dictionary.md#normative) [notions](dictionary.md#notion), since it shows that, say, the funny can't be understood in terms of amusement's making [sense](dictionary.md#sense) or being warranted by just any [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons). There is a distinction between an [emotion](dictionary.md#emotion) or [attitude's](dictionary.md#attitude) being "the [right](dictionary.md#right) way to feel" and its "getting [the relevant [value](dictionary.md#value)] [right](dictionary.md#right)." See also D'Arms and Jacobson 2000b. For an excellent [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of howwhat they call "fitting-attitude" (or "FA") analyses can deal with the problem of distinguishing [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of the [right](dictionary.md#right) from [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of the [wrong](dictionary.md#wrong) [kind](dictionary.md#kind), see Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen 2004. (See also Olson 2004.) I am indebted to Julian Darwall for [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of this general [issue](dictionary.md#issue) and to Joe Mendola for a question that helped me to see that Strawson's Point is an instance of it.

[^32]: Rabinowicz and Ronnøw-Rasmussen express essentially the same point by saying [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) of the [right](dictionary.md#right) [kind](dictionary.md#kind) also appear in the content of the [attitude](dictionary.md#attitude) for which they are [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons): the [attitude](dictionary.md#attitude) is toward something "on [account](dictionary.md#account) of" these [reasons](dictionary.md#reasons) (2004: 414). As W. D. Falk pointed out, a favoring that is relevant to [value](dictionary.md#value) is "by way of [true](dictionary.md#true) comprehension of what [the [object](dictionary.md#object)] is like" (1986: 117).
[^33]: [Compare](dictionary.md#compare) Prichard's [objection](dictionary.md#objection) to attempts to vindicate [morality](dictionary.md#morality) and [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) in terms of self-interest in Prichard 2002.
[^34]: Gary Watson stresses this (1987: 263, 264). Note also R. Jay Wallace: "there is an essential connection between the [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) and a [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [form](dictionary.md#form) of [evaluation](dictionary.md#evaluation)... that I [refer](dictionary.md#refer) to as holding a [person](dictionary.md#person) to an expectation (or [demand](dictionary.md#demand))" (1994: 19). See also Bennett 1980; Scanlon 1998: 272–290.

[^35]: "Having [rights](dictionary.md#right), of course, makes [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) [possible](dictionary.md#possible); but it is [claiming](dictionary.md#claim) that gives [rights](dictionary.md#right) their special [moral](dictionary.md#moral) significance. This feature of [rights](dictionary.md#right) is connected in a way with the customary rhetoric about what it is to be a [human being](dictionary.md#human%20being). Having [rights](dictionary.md#right) enables us to 'stand up like men,' to look others in the eye, and to feel in some [fundamental](dictionary.md#fundamental) way the [equal](dictionary.md#equal) of anyone" (Feinberg 1980: 151). [Compare](dictionary.md#compare) Mill: "To have a [right](dictionary.md#right), then, is, I conceive, to have something which society [ought](dictionary.md#ought) to defend me in the possession of" (1998: ch. 5).
[^36]: I am indebted to Mark LeBar for reminding me of Hohfeld's relevance here.
[^37]: Hohfeld sets out the "jural [correlatives](dictionary.md#correlative)" between [persons](dictionary.md#person) as [follows](dictionary.md#follow): (1) S has a [right](dictionary.md#right) against T *[if-and-only-if](dictionary.md#if-and-only-if)*, T has a [duty](dictionary.md#duty) to S; (2) S has a [power](dictionary.md#power) with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to T *[if-and-only-if](dictionary.md#if-and-only-if)*, T has a [liability](dictionary.md#liability) with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to S; (3) S has an [immunity](dictionary.md#immunity) with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to T *[if-and-only-if](dictionary.md#if-and-only-if)*, T has a [disability](dictionary.md#disability) with [respect](dictionary.md#respect) to S; and so on (1923: 65–75).

[^38]: See Thompson 2004. Also, [compare](dictionary.md#compare) here Locke's famous distinction between the [right](dictionary.md#right) every [individual](dictionary.md#individual) has in the state of [nature](dictionary.md#nature) to punish transgressions of [natural](dictionary.md#natural) [rights](dictionary.md#right) and victims' [rights](dictionary.md#right) "to seek reparation." Both are [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal), and both are held as [members](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community, but only the latter involves a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [address](dictionary.md#address) on behalf of the victim (Locke 1988: II, §7–11).<br>As I've [mentioned](dictionary.md#mention) and shall stress more strongly in the next chapter, someone's being under a [moral obligation](dictionary.md#moral%20obligation) not to step on your foot also [entails](dictionary.md#entail) a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) (in this case, of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community). What is [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) in [the case](dictionary.md#the%20case) of [rights](dictionary.md#right) is the [distinctive](dictionary.md#distinctive) [authority](dictionary.md#authority) of the [right](dictionary.md#right) [holder](dictionary.md#holder), including to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) compensation, as is [implicit](dictionary.md#implicit) in Locke's distinction between the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to punish (as a [member](dictionary.md#member) of the [moral](dictionary.md#moral) community) and the [authority](dictionary.md#authority) to [demand](dictionary.md#demand) compensation (as the right-holding victim).

[^39]: Hart notes that he is here broadly [following](dictionary.md#follow) Kant's [doctrine](dictionary.md#doctrine) in the *Rechtslehre* (Kant 1996c: 230–231). We [will](dictionary.md#will) [consider](dictionary.md#consider) a further [expression](dictionary.md#expression) of this idea in Fichte's [claim](dictionary.md#claim) that a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) stance presupposes a "[principle](dictionary.md#principle) of [right](dictionary.md#right)" ("I must in all cases [recognize](dictionary.md#recognize) the [free](dictionary.md#free) being outside me as a [free](dictionary.md#free) being, i.e., I must limit my [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom) through the [concept](dictionary.md#concept) of the [possibility](dictionary.md#possibility) of his [freedom](dictionary.md#freedom)") (2000: 49).
[^40]: I am indebted here to [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) with Tom Hurka.
[^41]: However, Hart sometimes seems to restrict [obligations](dictionary.md#obligation) even further to those that are voluntarily [assumed](dictionary.md#assume) or created (1965: 179n). I am indebted here to Rob Kar.

[^42]: These are, more strictly, [presuppositions](dictionary.md#presupposition) of their [address](dictionary.md#address) and acknowledgment, respectively, in the [sense](dictionary.md#sense) [mentioned](dictionary.md#mention) earlier in the chapter. The [individuals](dictionary.md#individual) themselves might not [accept](dictionary.md#accept) or even reject them. I [will](dictionary.md#will) return to this point presently.
[^43]: Ultimately, I [argue](dictionary.md#argue), this competence amounts to Kant's "[autonomy](dictionary.md#autonomy) of the [will](dictionary.md#will)": "the [property](dictionary.md#property) of the [will](dictionary.md#will) by which it is a [law](dictionary.md#law) to itself independently of any [property](dictionary.md#property) of the [objects](dictionary.md#object) of volition" (Kant 1996b: 441). Also, see Gibbard 1990: 68–82, on the psychology of norm-acceptance. We might still call such states [desires](dictionary.md#desire), but if so, we [will](dictionary.md#will) need nonetheless to [recognize](dictionary.md#recognize) that they are "principle-dependent" rather than "object-dependent" [desires](dictionary.md#desire). For this distinction, see Rawls 2000: 45–48, 148–152.
[^44]: A similar idea seems at work in the writings of Emmanuel Le´vinas about encountering the "other," for example, Le´vinas 1969. I am indebted here to Rachana Kamtekar.<br>For an illuminating [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of the way in which, according to Le´vinas, encountering an other "face to face" involves a [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [demand](dictionary.md#demand) for [respect](dictionary.md#respect), see Putnam 2002.

[^45]: Published in 1796–97, just before Kant's *Rechtlehre.* See Frederick Neuhouser's very helpful introduction to Fichte 2000.
[^46]: Pufendorf 's Point resonates with Hart's distinction between being obliged (by force or [circumstance](dictionary.md#circumstance)) and being [obligated](dictionary.md#obligate) (1961: 6–8).
[^47]: On the significance of the [ability](dictionary.md#ability) to hold oneself [responsible](dictionary.md#responsible), see Westlund 2003. Cf. Kant's remark that "I can [recognize](dictionary.md#recognize) that I am under [obligation](dictionary.md#obligation) to others only insofar as I at the same time put myself under [obligation](dictionary.md#obligation)" (1996b: 6:417).
[^48]: I am indebted to Eric Schliesser for pressing me on this point.
[^49]: This is, of course, a favorite theme of Hegel's in *The Phenomenology of [Spirit](dictionary.md#spirit)* (1977).

[^50]: See Neufeld 1951. For an [interesting](dictionary.md#interest) [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of the development of our [contemporary](dictionary.md#contemporary) [notion](dictionary.md#notion) of [responsibility](dictionary.md#responsibility) and associated [practices](dictionary.md#practice) of [legal](dictionary.md#legal) [accountability](dictionary.md#accountability), which argues that [courts](dictionary.md#court) were initially conceived of as sites of neutral and [reasoned](dictionary.md#reason) [adjudication](dictionary.md#adjudication) between parties who would otherwise exact or suffer vengeance, see Pound 1922: ch. 4. I am indebted to Randall Curren for this [reference](dictionary.md#reference) and for helpful [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion). See Chapter 4 below for a [discussion](dictionary.md#discussion) of the difference between the [desire](dictionary.md#desire) to retaliate or avenge and [reactive](dictionary.md#reactive) [attitudes](dictionary.md#attitude) as implicitly seeking [second-personal](dictionary.md#second-personal) [recognition](dictionary.md#recognition) or [respect](dictionary.md#respect).
