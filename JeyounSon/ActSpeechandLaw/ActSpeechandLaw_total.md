# Act Speech and the Construction of Legal Normativity: Citizen Compliance as a Source of Legal Meaning

# Abstract

This paper develops a rigorous philosophical account of how ordinary citizens’ normative actions – especially their law-abiding behavior – function as a form of “act speech” that contributes to the construction and modulation of legal normativity. Working within a broadly legal positivist framework that preserves the distinction between the existence of law (as social fact) and its moral justification, the paper challenges the conventional positivist view that only officials (lawmakers, judges) contribute to the formation of legal meaning. Drawing on analytic philosophy of language, particularly speech act theory and its critiques, as well as metaethical expressivism and holistically inferential theories of meaning (in the vein of Quine and Brandom), I argue that the practices of citizens can be understood as meaningful contributions to the propositional content of legal rules. Citizen compliance and normative behavior, viewed through Quinean and Brandomian models of meaning as inferential and holistic, emerge as a kind of communal *speech act* that helps determine how legal norms are understood and applied in context. The analysis highlights how citizens, by *doing* the law (obeying, interpreting, or even quietly reshaping it in practice), participate in a dynamic process of constructing legal normativity. Although this perspective expands the role of citizens in giving shape to legal content, it remains within a positivist understanding of law as grounded in social facts, thereby maintaining the conceptual separation between what the law *is* and what the law *ought to be*. The paper’s narrative structure and clarity draw inspiration from the styles of Ronald Dworkin and Cass Sunstein, presenting the argument in an accessible yet philosophically rigorous manner. References to both classical and contemporary literature in jurisprudence, philosophy of language, and metaethics are provided to situate and support the argument.

# Introduction

In a well-functioning legal system, citizens generally obey the law: drivers stop at red lights, taxpayers file returns, neighbors keep noise within legal limits. Legal philosophy, especially in the positivist tradition, has often treated this widespread law-abiding behavior as a *consequence* of law’s authority rather than as a *source* of legal meaning. The standard positivist picture draws a sharp division between those who *make or declare* the law – legislators, judges, officials – and those who *merely follow* it. H.L.A. Hart’s classic account, for example, locates the foundations of a legal system in a social rule (the “rule of recognition”) observed by officials, not ordinary citizens. In Hart’s view, to say a rule is legally valid is to indicate it passes the tests set out by that rule of recognition. Importantly, on this conventional view, a law’s validity or content does *not* depend on how many citizens obey it or how they interpret it in daily life. A rule duly enacted can be valid *even if widely ignored* by the public. In short, legal meaning is seen as fixed by official acts and institutional criteria, while citizens are expected to comply but are not credited with shaping the content of the law.

This orthodox positivist stance reflects a broader conceptual commitment: the separation of *law’s existence* from *law’s justification*. Legal norms exist as valid law by virtue of social facts (pedigree, enactment, recognition by officials), not by virtue of their moral merits or the degree of popular acceptance. In maintaining this separation, positivists assert that asking *what the law is* is a different inquiry from asking *whether it is just or why it binds*. We shall uphold this separation. The account developed in this paper does not claim that citizens’ attitudes or moral judgments *determine* what the law is (that would entangle law’s existence with its justification). Instead, our claim is subtler: within the space allowed by a positivist framework, citizens’ normative actions can *communicate* content and affect how the law is understood and applied, thereby *modulating* legal normativity even as the formal existence of law remains anchored in official acts. In other words, citizens contribute to the *meaning* and effective scope of legal rules through their practices, without usurping the officials’ role in declaring what counts as law.

To make this case, we need to reconceptualize law-abiding behavior as a form of meaningful activity – a kind of “speech” in the medium of action. The notion that actions can speak is familiar in ordinary life: a salute can **express** respect, a protest march can **convey** a political demand, and even mundane etiquette (like queueing in line) **communicates** mutual acknowledgment of a rule (“first come, first served”). Such actions are not mere motions of the body; they are imbued with *intentional content* and understood against a backdrop of social norms. When a citizen complies with a legal norm – say, recycling household waste in compliance with a municipal ordinance – that action might similarly be viewed as expressing a certain understanding of the rule and an endorsement of its normative force. The central question of this paper is: *Can we theorize citizens’ law-abiding conduct as a kind of speech act that contributes to the content of legal norms?* What would it mean for *actions* to function analogously to *speech acts* in the legal domain, and how would this align with a legal positivist account of law?

Addressing this question requires an interdisciplinary approach. The paper will draw on **analytic philosophy of language**, particularly J.L. Austin’s and John Searle’s theories of speech acts, which illuminate how saying something can *do* something (from making promises to giving orders). We will extend and adapt speech act theory – and consider its critiques – to see how *doing something* (acting in accordance with a rule) might also count as saying something about normative commitments. The discussion also engages **metaethics**, especially *expressivist* theories which hold that normative statements function to express attitudes or commitments rather than describe facts. Expressivism will help us frame law-following behavior as expressing an underlying attitude of rule-acceptance or obligation. Furthermore, we turn to insights from **semantic holism** and **inferentialism** – notably W\.V.O. Quine’s picture of meaning as distributed across a web of beliefs, and Robert Brandom’s model of meaning as rooted in inferential roles within social practice. These perspectives will support the idea that the meaning of a legal norm is not an isolated artifact handed down by an official, but something that emerges from its place in a whole network of inferences, usages, and expectations within a community. If meaning is holistic and practice-dependent, then the way ordinary people infer and apply legal rules in everyday life could be an integral part of what those rules *mean* in practice.

The narrative arc of the paper proceeds as follows. In **Part I**, I outline the conventional legal positivist view of legal normativity, highlighting how it allocates the meaning-making role to officials and treats citizens’ compliance as largely a *result* of law’s normativity (or a condition of its stability) rather than a *component* of that normativity. This sets up the target for our challenge. **Part II** introduces the concept of “act speech” through a discussion of speech act theory. We examine how utterances can perform actions (Austin’s illocutionary acts) and consider the possibility of *actions* functioning communicatively in a rule-governed context. I argue that law-abiding behavior can be seen as analogous to an illocutionary act – one by which citizens *assert*, *endorse*, or otherwise *give force to* a normative content. **Part III** delves into metaethical expressivism and normative holism. Here, we use expressivism to interpret citizens’ rule-following as expressions of commitment or acceptance, and we use Quinean/Brandomian holism to explain how those individual expressions gain meaning only within an inferentially connected whole (the community’s pattern of behavior and reasoning). **Part IV** synthesizes these insights to present a model of citizens as co-authors of legal meaning. In this model, the “propositional content” of legal rules is not static or determined solely by official fiat, but is continuously *constructed and modulated* by the way officials and citizens alike *use* those rules within a form of life. I will illustrate with examples how shifts in citizen behavior can subtly shift the understanding of a rule – for instance, how consistent patterns of compliance or non-compliance lead to evolving interpretations by courts or authorities. Finally, in **Part V**, the paper considers the implications of this view for legal positivism and the rule of recognition. We will see that incorporating citizen-driven “act speech” into our account of law’s normativity does not undermine the separateness of law and morality, nor does it hand over the keys of law-making to the mob; rather, it enriches our understanding of the *social facts* that underlie legal systems, suggesting that those facts include not just the formal actions of officials but the meaningful normative actions of the whole community of legal actors.

Throughout the discussion, the tone will remain analytically rigorous yet accessible. The argument is built step by step – much in the spirit of Ronald Dworkin’s style of posing a problem with the conventional view and then gently but persistently unraveling a new perspective, or Cass Sunstein’s talent for blending theory with practical insight. By the end of the paper, we aim to see citizens’ everyday law-following in a new light: not as a dull habit of obedience, but as an active, meaning-laden contribution to what law *is* for that society.

# I. Legal Positivism and the Official-Centric View of Legal Meaning

Legal positivism, in its standard form, asserts that the existence and content of law are matters of social fact and convention, not dependent on moral evaluation. This approach, powerfully articulated by H.L.A. Hart, holds that a legal system is founded on a union of primary rules (duty-imposing rules governing behavior) and secondary rules (rules about how primary rules are made, changed, and identified). The ultimate secondary rule in Hart’s theory is the *rule of recognition*, a societal rule specifying the criteria by which valid legal norms are identified. Crucially, Hart maintained that the rule of recognition is a convention among *officials* – judges, legislators, and other authorities – who accept and practice this rule in carrying out their official duties. By observing what standards officials actually use (for example, “what the Parliament enacts is law” or “written constitutional norms take precedence”), we can infer the content of the rule of recognition in a given system. Ordinary citizens, however, “remain at the periphery” of this picture. They are the *addressees* of the primary rules, expected to obey the law, but they are not participants in the creation or validation of law’s content under Hart’s framework.

One of the implications of Hart’s view is a clear conceptual separation between *legal validity* and *social efficacy*. A law can be perfectly valid (i.e., part of the legal system) even if people do not obey it. Hart gives the example of a statute prohibiting jaywalking in New York City: even if “most everyone” jaywalks, the rule against jaywalking still **exists as law** because it was properly enacted and is recognized as such by officials. In Hart’s words, *validity* is conferred by meeting the criteria of the rule of recognition, not by the law’s effectiveness in guiding behavior. Thus, the statement that a rule is “valid law” means simply that it satisfies all the formal criteria (for pedigree, form, etc.) required by the rule of recognition. It does *not* mean that the rule is just, nor even that it is widely obeyed. To underscore this point, Hart (echoing the earlier positivist John Austin) noted that the *efficacy* of the legal system as a whole depends on a sufficient degree of compliance by the population – without general obedience, a legal system would collapse – but the validity of each **individual** law does not depend on universal obedience. There can be *valid but dormant* laws. Conversely, there can be patterns of social behavior that people follow as if they were law, but which are not valid law because they were not created in accordance with the rule of recognition (for example, a neighborhood custom that has never been recognized by any court or statute).

Hans Kelsen’s version of legal positivism similarly distinguished between the *normative validity* of law and its *social efficacy*. Kelsen argued that a legal norm’s validity is a function of it being created in accordance with the Basic Norm (Grundnorm) of the legal system, whereas efficacy (Wirksamkeit) refers to the fact that the norm is actually followed or enforced in society. A legal system needs a minimum degree of efficacy to be *by and large* valid, but specific norms do not lose validity just because people disobey them occasionally. In Kelsen’s Pure Theory of Law, the chain of validity bottoms out in the presupposed Basic Norm (“One ought to obey the constitution”); as long as that presupposition is not contravened by wholesale disregard, the legal system’s norms remain valid. Both Hart and Kelsen, in effect, relegate citizen behavior to the factual backdrop – relevant to sociology or stability, but not constitutive of law’s content or existence.

Under these orthodox accounts, then, **legal meaning and normativity flow from the top down**. Legislators declare rules; judges authoritatively interpret and apply them; officials enforce them. The role of the public is mainly to be guided by these rules. Hart did acknowledge that citizens can adopt the “internal point of view” with respect to the law – that is, they can accept the law’s rules as guides to conduct and not merely as external incentives or threats. Indeed, he noted that a healthy legal system often involves not only officials but many citizens taking an internal, rule-oriented stance (following the law *because* it is the law). However, even this internalization by citizens is, in Hart’s account, conceptually secondary. It is *expected* that many citizens will internalize legal norms, but the definitive criterion for what counts as law remains the practice and attitudes of officials (judges accepting a constitution, etc.), not the attitudes of the general populace. As Hart famously put it, a legal system exists when, first, the bulk of the population obeys the primary rules, and second, the officials accept the secondary rules from an internal point of view. The citizens’ obedience is noted as a necessary condition for the *existence* of a legal system, but it is not itself a *source* of law; it is a condition of efficacy, analogous to the way a vehicle needs fuel to run, but the design of the engine (the structure of law) is another matter.

This official-centric, top-down view has been challenged and refined in various ways by later legal theorists, but even inclusive or “soft” positivist theories tend to preserve the hierarchical role assignment. Inclusive positivists (like Jules Coleman or Wilfrid Waluchow) allow that moral or social principles can be criteria of legal validity *if* the rule of recognition so provides (for instance, a constitution might require that laws not violate fundamental principles of justice). But again, it is the **official** incorporation of those criteria that matters. Unless the legal system’s rules say so, popular moral disapproval of a statute does not negate its legality. In sum, positivism’s conceptual apparatus – the rule of recognition, validity as pedigree, the separation of is/ought – all seem to suggest that while citizen behavior is an important sociological fact, it is not part of the *meaning* of legal norms. Legal meaning is determined by sources (like statutes, precedents) and authoritative interpretations, not by the multitude of non-authoritative interpretations enacted in daily life by laypeople.

Yet, intuitively, there is something unsatisfying about the idea that citizens contribute nothing to legal meaning. We might consider an analogy: language. A language like English is not created solely by lexicographers or grammarians; it evolves through use by the community of speakers. Dictionaries and grammars *codify* and *guide* usage but do not exhaustively determine it. The meaning of words emerges from how people use them in myriad situations, and even official attempts to coin or redefine terms only take root if they enter common usage. Could law be, to some extent, similar? The legal officials might be like lexicographers of law, issuing authoritative texts and decisions, but the community of practitioners (which includes citizens) might collectively *confer life* on those legal norms by the way they are actually followed, ignored, stretched, or construed in everyday situations. This is not a standard positivist way of speaking about law, but it bears exploring. After all, even Hart’s framework allows that much of law in primitive societies consists of *customary rules* emerging from social practices. In advanced systems, Hart focused on statutes and courts, but perhaps the pendulum swung too far in sidelining the role of lay practice.

Recent legal theorists have indeed probed this issue. Andrei Marmor, for instance, has emphasized that law functions as a form of communication and that understanding law requires understanding the *context* and *pragmatics* of legal utterances (much as one would for ordinary language). Other scholars have argued that legal norms have a “social meaning” that is shaped by public expectations and behavior. One example is the phenomenon of *desuetude*, where a law that is never enforced and widely disregarded can over time be considered invalid or repealed (some jurisdictions recognize desuetude formally). The very possibility of desuetude indicates that at some point, sheer lack of citizen compliance (combined with official inaction) can effectively remove a rule from the working body of law – social practice has negated formal law. Conversely, consider how societal changes in behavior can push the law to adapt: the meaning of concepts like “cruel and unusual punishment” or “equality” can shift as public standards evolve, even before courts explicitly redefine those terms. In tort law, the “reasonable person” standard explicitly ties legal obligations to community norms of behavior – effectively *borrowing* the content of the law from the way an average member of the community would act. All of these observations suggest that the bright line between officials as meaning-makers and citizens as passive subjects might be too crude.

To sharpen the issue: *Can legal norms get their meaning, in part, from the way citizens understand and follow them?* The remainder of this paper argues affirmatively, developing a theory that remains within positivism’s commitment to source-based law but recognizes the inferential, communicative interplay between official pronouncements and lived normative practice. The first step is to establish a vocabulary and framework for treating actions as bearers of meaning – to treat what citizens do as a kind of “speech.” For this, we turn to speech act theory.

# II. From Speech Acts to Act-Speech: How Actions Can Speak Normatively

**A. Speech Act Theory and Legal Language:** J.L. Austin’s seminal insight in *How to Do Things with Words* (1962) was that utterances are not only vehicles for stating facts but can also *perform* actions. When a person with the appropriate authority and context says “I pronounce you husband and wife” or “I apologize,” they are not describing a marriage or stating that they feel sorry – they are *creating* the marriage, *doing* the act of apologizing, respectively. Austin called such utterances **performative speech acts**, and distinguished the *locutionary* aspect (the literal meaning of the words), the *illocutionary force* (the conventional force or action performed by saying those words), and the *perlocutionary effect* (the consequences or responses the utterance brings about in the world). John Searle further developed this framework, classifying speech acts (assertives, directives, commissives, expressives, declarations) and introducing the notion of **constitutive rules** of speech acts – general rules of the form “X counts as Y in context C” that make certain utterances count as particular actions (e.g. saying “I promise” in appropriate conditions counts as undertaking an obligation).

Legal speech is deeply entwined with speech acts. A statute enacted by a legislature is not merely a description – it *creates* a new legal rule (an exercise of **legislative illocutionary power**). A judge’s pronouncement “Defendant is liable for negligence” in a judgment is a speech act that makes it the case (within the legal system) that the defendant has a legal obligation to pay damages. In speech act terms, many legal utterances are **declarations**: by the very act of uttering (with authority), they bring about a change in normative status (e.g., from innocent to guilty, from having no duty to having a duty). The theory of law as comprised of *speech acts by officials* is already well-recognized. For example, criminalization has been analyzed as a communicative act by the state: when the legislature criminalizes certain conduct, it “speaks” to citizens by declaring that conduct off-limits, thereby both describing it as wrong and making it punishable. The criminal law thus “expresses to citizens that they are under obligations” not to perform the forbidden act. In short, the **law *speaks*** through the actions of its officials; law is not only a system of rules but a system of communicated norms.

However, our focus is the other side of the coin: can *citizens’ actions* be understood as communicative acts within this system of normativity? If officials speak to citizens through law, do citizens *speak back* (or amongst themselves) through compliance or noncompliance? For a theoretical model, consider how actions can carry meaning in ordinary social contexts. The old adage “actions speak louder than words” contains a truth: we often treat actions as messages. If someone consistently arrives early to meetings, their behavior “says” something about their respect for others’ time or the importance they attribute to the task. In a more convention-laden example, think of saluting a flag, bowing in a ceremony, or performing a handshake – these actions have understood meanings and can even perform functions like showing allegiance or sealing an agreement. They are not mere physical movements; they are *conventional acts* in a system of social significance.

Now, law-abiding behavior is generally not as explicitly communicative as a salute or a spoken promise. People usually obey the law for any number of personal reasons (fear of sanctions, moral belief in the law’s rightness, habit, etc.), not necessarily to send a message. Yet, if we zoom out to the level of patterns and practices, a society’s overall compliance with a law does send a message – at least to observers and to officials – about how that law is perceived and integrated into the community’s normative life. Consider a community where a new environmental regulation is introduced (say, a ban on single-use plastics). If citizens broadly and eagerly comply – swapping plastic bags for reusable totes and encouraging others to do the same – their behavior can be read as **affirmation** of the norm’s legitimacy or usefulness. Through their acts, they **express** acceptance of the new standard. If, on the contrary, citizens flout the rule en masse (continuing to use plastics, perhaps covertly or with open defiance), that pattern of noncompliance **communicates** resistance or a belief that the rule is unwise or illegitimate. Sociologically, lawmakers will take note of such patterns as feedback on the rule’s reception. But philosophically, we can say more: these patterns of action are *semiotic* in nature – they carry information about the community’s normative attitudes.

To connect this to speech act theory, we can analogize a citizen’s *compliance act* to an illocutionary act. When I, as a citizen, obey a particular law in a particular instance, I might be understood as performing an act of **acceptance** or **acknowledgment** of that law’s normative claim. My silent action speaks: it says, in effect, “I treat this rule as binding (in this situation).” If a large number of citizens perform similar acts, they collectively **reinforce** the rule’s meaning. In contrast, if I violate the rule (and especially if I do so *openly* and try to justify it), I might be attempting an illocutionary act of **denial** or **protest**, saying “I do not regard this rule as legitimate or applicable (perhaps because I think an exception should apply).” Indeed, open civil disobedience is often deliberately communicative – the violator wants to send a message about the law’s injustice. But even routine, non-dramatic compliance can be viewed through this lens. It can be compared to a kind of *default illocutionary stance*: following the law without fuss often conveys, implicitly, “this is the way things ought to be done.” It’s akin to the conversational principle that not objecting to a statement can serve as tacit assent in context.

**B. Uptake, Convention, and the Social Audience:** A key aspect of Austin’s theory is that for a speech act to succeed, it usually requires appropriate conventions and often an audience that understands the act. The *uptake* of the act by others confirms its illocutionary force. For instance, saying “I christen this ship the *Queen Mary*” while smashing a bottle of champagne is effective only if done in the right ceremonial context and if observers treat that utterance as the christening. By analogy, for citizens’ actions to function as “act speech” in law, there must be a conventional or practice-based way of *interpreting* those actions as meaningful. If one lone individual obeys a law for idiosyncratic reasons, it might not mean much. But when we see a stable practice – e.g., everyone in town stops at a particular intersection even in the absence of a stop sign, effectively creating an informal norm – we have a convention that the action (stopping) is expected, and that convention itself becomes reason for others to do likewise (a new norm has emerged). In such cases, the citizen’s action communicates because others recognize it as part of a pattern. Applied to formal law: the “uptake” of citizens’ law-following is partly done by officials who notice and perhaps rely on common behaviors, and partly by fellow citizens who adjust their own expectations.

One might object that labeling citizen compliance as a speech act is metaphorical at best. After all, typical speech acts involve intentional communication – a speaker intends to convey something to a listener. Do citizens intend to convey anything by simply obeying the law? Not explicitly in most cases. However, philosophers of language have long noted that *meaning* need not be tied to the speaker’s conscious intent in every instance; meaning can also be an emergent property of use. In Lewisian terms, a *convention* can arise where people’s behavior and expectations create a self-reinforcing pattern with a shared meaning, even if no one “declared” that meaning outright. Moreover, if we take an expansive view of who the “audience” is, we see that citizens’ actions are observed by others in the community and by officials, and these observers do draw inferences. Judges, for instance, sometimes consider evidence of community practice when interpreting vague legal standards (as mentioned, tort law’s “reasonable person” or standards of decency in constitutional law). Legislators too may look at compliance rates and public attitudes as indications of whether a law is working or needs amendment. In this way, citizen behavior feeds back into the legal system’s self-understanding.

Crucially, treating citizen action as communicative does not mean each individual is intentionally legislating by their behavior. Rather, the **aggregate pattern** or **common practice** is what carries meaning. This is consistent with the idea from Quine and others that meaning is not located in isolated events but in a holistic pattern. It is also consistent with jurisprudential theories that emphasize practice – for example, the *practice theory of norms* or Eugen Ehrlich’s concept of the “living law” which resides in social practice. We remain within a positivist approach if we say: these practices matter only insofar as they can be observed and factored into the operations of the legal system (there is no mysterious moral transubstantiation happening). But the point is that they *can* be so factored, and often are implicitly.

Let us take a simple but illustrative scenario. Imagine a traffic law states “No vehicles in the park.” Officials promulgate this rule (perhaps a city council ordinance). Now consider how its meaning might be clarified or changed over time by citizen practice. In Year 1, everyone strictly avoids bringing any vehicle, including bicycles, into the park, interpreting “vehicle” broadly. Observing this, park authorities and police also enforce it broadly. In Year 2, people start to routinely bring bicycles, and no one seems to mind; the community’s behavior suggests they interpret “vehicle” to exclude bicycles (treating only motor vehicles as intended). Police, noticing no objections and perhaps sharing the view that bikes are harmless, refrain from ticketing cyclists. The **community practice** has now effectively **narrowed** the meaning of the rule in practice. By Year 3, this understanding is so entrenched that a new sign is posted: “No motor vehicles in the park.” Here, citizen action functioned as a kind of proposal or assertion – by their actions, they “said”: “We consider bicycles permissible.” The law’s enforcers tacitly accepted that assertion, and eventually the explicit formulation of the rule changed to reflect it. This dynamic can be described without leaving positivism: initially, the law had some open texture (what counts as a “vehicle”); through practice, a customary interpretation arose; officials, seeing that custom, incorporated it, making it de jure.

One might argue that this shows only that officials ultimately sanctioned the new meaning – so isn’t it still the officials giving the law its content, with citizens merely providing input? Yes and no. In a strict sense, before the sign changed, the letter of the law hadn’t changed, but its *effective meaning* had shifted in the interim due to the social context of enforcement. Even Hart acknowledged that where rules have a **penumbra of uncertainty**, judges inevitably rely on social facts and purposes to interpret them. The citizens in our example created a social fact – a pattern of usage – that made one interpretation more reasonable. The officials’ role became one of *recognizing* a fait accompli of meaning, rather than choosing arbitrarily. In many cases, officials do and *must* interpret law in light of societal context; when they do so, they are treating citizen practices as bearers of meaning or at least as evidence of meaning. This indicates that, whether explicitly theorized or not, the legal system does treat citizen behavior as *communicative*.

In summary, by extending speech act theory to encompass rule-governed actions, we can conceive of a spectrum: at one end, purely linguistic acts by authorities that create law; at the other, purely behavioral acts by citizens that seem non-communicative. In the middle, however, lies a continuum of *socially meaningful behavior*. Law-abiding behavior lies on this continuum. When a citizen complies with a legal norm in a way that aligns with how others comply and with a shared understanding of the situation, that act reinforces and *articulates* the content of the norm. It is a piece of the ongoing discourse of normativity in the community, even if it is not verbal discourse. To fully flesh out this picture, we next examine how metaethical expressivism and holistic theories of meaning provide a philosophical foundation for understanding the *content* that such act-speech carries.

# III. Expressivism and Normative Holism: The Inferential Meaning of Compliance

**A. Normative Expressivism: Attitudes in Action** – In metaethics, *expressivist* theories of moral language (sometimes called non-cognitivist theories) assert that when we make moral or normative statements, we are not primarily stating facts but expressing our conative attitudes or commitments. For example, according to expressivists like Simon Blackburn and Allan Gibbard, to say “Stealing is wrong” is not to report a truth about the world but to express disapproval of stealing (and perhaps to prescribe not stealing). Such a statement might also function to encourage others to share that attitude. Expressivism highlights the *action-guiding* and *attitude-expressing* function of normative language: it’s akin to a speech act of prescribing or commending, rather than a mere description.

If we apply an expressivist lens to law-abiding behavior, we might say: by following a rule, an individual expresses an attitude of “this ought to be done” or “I accept this norm.” It’s as if their action is the physical analogue of asserting a normative judgment aligning with the law. Consider someone who meticulously sorts their recyclables in compliance with recycling laws. Their action can be seen as expressing the attitude that recycling is required or good – an attitude of norm-acceptance. Meanwhile, a person who pointedly refuses to sort recyclables might be expressing rejection of that norm (perhaps thinking it’s pointless or overreaching). The *meaning* behind the actions, in expressivist terms, is the attitude being conveyed or manifested.

One advantage of expressivism here is that it does not require that the citizen’s action be interpreted as a claim about a matter of fact (indeed, the person recycling might not be making any claim about facts). Instead, it’s a *normative stance*. Law is a system of norms, and by aligning one’s behavior with a norm, one is taking a stance with respect to it (endorsement via behavior, or at least acquiescence). This is a kind of content that actions are well-suited to express. After all, actions are themselves what norms ultimately pertain to – to follow a norm is to do or abstain from an action. Thus, action is the most direct way of *showing* one’s commitment to the norm. In the philosophy of language, this is reminiscent of Wittgenstein’s point: *“An ‘inner process’ stands in need of outward criteria”*. If someone privately “accepts” a rule but never actually follows it, can we say they truly accepted it? Genuine rule-following is exhibited in practice. Wittgenstein famously wrote, *“‘Obeying a rule’ is a practice. And to think one is obeying a rule is not to obey a rule”* (PI §202). In other words, it’s the **practice** – the outward, shared patterns of activity – that counts as rule-following. This Wittgensteinian view strongly supports our thesis: what a rule *means* and what it is to *follow* it are not just mental or official matters; they are embedded in the practice of a community.

Expressivism also offers insight into how multiple normative attitudes can coexist or conflict. A citizen might follow a law out of fear (expressing no endorsement, just prudence regarding punishment), or out of duty (expressing moral endorsement of legal authority), or out of social conformity (expressing an identity as a good citizen). These differences might not be externally visible in the single act of compliance, but across a population, patterns might emerge (e.g., compliance erodes when enforcement is not visible might indicate people were motivated by fear rather than inner acceptance). The *quality* of the expressed attitude – sincere endorsement versus forced submission – can significantly affect the norm’s stability and evolution. If most people merely grudgingly comply, the norm may be more brittle, and its meaning to them is “do this or else” (a pragmatic ultimatum rather than an internalized standard). If most people embrace it, the norm’s meaning in society might shift towards being a part of the social ethos (like how wearing seatbelts, once seen as a hassle mandated by law, became seen as a commonsense safety measure widely accepted).

In the legal philosophy literature, some have argued that the normativity of law – its *binding force* – cannot be explained without reference to the attitudes of those who are bound. Andreas Funke, for instance, contends that legal theory has been too focused on the *application* of norms by officials and neglects the *observance* of norms by citizens. He suggests that “compliance is an essential part” of the picture of legal normativity and that it should not be conceived as mere obedience, but connected with autonomy and interpretation. In other words, a citizen’s compliance involves an *interpretation* of the norm in the particular context and an autonomous decision to accept it. Funke even argues that the observance of law cannot be separated from its justification – a claim that goes further than our positivist framework might allow, but it highlights the intimate link between *why* people follow norms and *what those norms mean*. Our account resonates with Funke’s point to the extent that we see citizens as active interpreters of norms, not just passive followers. Every act of compliance is, in a sense, an act of *applying* the norm to a concrete circumstance (deciding that *this* behavior falls under what the rule requires). When thousands of citizens independently make similar applications of a rule, they generate a de facto interpretive consensus (or reveal an ambiguity if their applications diverge). Thus, compliance can be seen as a decentralized process of norm application that runs in parallel to the official processes.

**B. Quinean Holism and Brandomian Inferentialism:** The idea that meaning is **holistically distributed** and **inferentially articulated** is a cornerstone of certain philosophies of language and mind. W\.V.O. Quine, in arguing against the analytic-synthetic distinction, famously stated that our statements (and by extension, many meanings) face experience not in isolation but only as a “corporate body”. Each belief or sentence derives its content from its role in a larger web of beliefs; you cannot fully pin down what one concept means without assuming a whole lot of other supporting inferential connections. Applied to normative systems, this suggests that one cannot determine the content of a single legal rule in isolation from other rules and practices. The meaning of a rule is intertwined with how it interacts with other norms (legal or social) and how people reason from that rule in conjunction with others.

Robert Brandom builds on this holism with a detailed account of *inferentialism*: the meaning of a concept or expression is given by the inferences it licenses and the inferences that lead to it. For Brandom, to grasp a concept is to understand what follows from applying it and what would entitle one to apply it. He emphasizes that this is an inherently **normative** affair: making an assertion is to undertake a commitment, and others in the discourse keep track of what one is committed or entitled to say given that assertion. In *Making It Explicit* (1994), Brandom portrays communication as a game of giving and asking for reasons, where each move (assertion) has consequences for what other moves are acceptable. Translated to the legal context, one might say that participating in a legal system – whether as judge, lawyer, or citizen – involves navigating the inferential connections of legal concepts. For instance, if I accept (implicitly by my actions) that “vehicles are not allowed in the park,” I am also committing to certain inferences: that I shouldn’t drive my car there, that if I see someone driving there I can criticize them, that a bicycle might or might not count depending on further norms, etc. The *content* of “vehicle” in this rule is constituted by all these inferential implications and applications.

When citizens routinely act in certain ways, they reveal which inferences they are drawing. If every citizen treats a bicycle as not a “vehicle” under the rule (by riding bikes in the park happily), they manifest an understanding – an inferential stance – that “vehicle” in this context implies “motor vehicle.” If most citizens also refrain from rollerblading in the park, perhaps because they generalize the norm to any wheels, that indicates a broader reading. Each citizen in isolation might not reflect deeply on these inferences, but collectively their behavior exhibits a pattern of inferences being endorsed in practice. It’s as if the community is solving a simultaneous equation of what the rule means by each person’s behavior providing constraints that must be reconciled with others’. The result is a holistic equilibrium of meaning (which may still have indeterminacies at the fringes).

Brandom also stresses the social nature of normativity: the “scorekeeping” model where each participant keeps track of others’ commitments. In a legal context, officials keep score of citizens’ compliance (as data about norm acceptance), and citizens keep score of each other (social norms of blaming those who break the law, or sometimes of tolerating certain breaches). Through this mutual scorekeeping, the community negotiates the contours of what is required or permitted. Citizens, of course, do this less formally than judges, but even a casual remark like “I didn’t know that law applied to this situation; nobody does that here” is a bit of informal jurisprudence – it’s interpreting the norm in light of observed practice.

The holistic view implies that **legal normativity is distributed** across the many acts of interpretation and application by all participants. There is no single point (not even a Supreme Court ruling) that can freeze a meaning forever independent of how it’s later taken up. Consider the idea of *normative holism* specifically: the effect of one norm on behavior can depend on the presence of other norms. For example, a norm “keep off the grass” might be strictly obeyed until another norm “picnicking is allowed on the grass on Sundays” comes into play; then people adjust how they interpret and prioritize these norms together. Normative holism recognizes that people manage norms as a whole package, not one by one. This management is an intelligent activity done by citizens as well as officials.

**C. The Inferential Content of Law-Abiding Behavior:** Let’s marry these insights to our theme. A citizen’s law-abiding action has **propositional content** insofar as it figures in inferences. If I see my neighbor composting kitchen waste, I may infer that there is a rule or at least a local expectation to compost (and indeed many places have made this a legal requirement). The neighbor’s action, together with my background understanding of local laws or norms, carries the information: “composting is required/permissible here.” The neighbor might not be *trying* to inform me, but the action nonetheless *asserts* that content in practice. Likewise, if I observe that no one litters in a certain park, I infer not just that people are tidy but that they all recognize either a law or a strong norm against littering. Their refraining from littering speaks – it asserts “littering is not allowed/acceptable.” These are straightforward inferences that outsiders or community members draw, showcasing that behavior can imply rule content.

Now consider the internal inferential role for the actor. By obeying a law in a specific instance, the actor is implicitly committed to certain propositions: *if* asked “Was your conduct required by law?,” they would likely answer yes, thus endorsing that interpretation. If someone asks “Why did you do X instead of Y?,” they might reply “Because it’s the law” – effectively citing the norm as a reason and thereby *affirming the norm’s applicability*. So even verbally, law-abiding people often explicitly express the content behind their actions. We see that the line between acting and speaking blurs in the reasoning process: the *reason* behind the action (which may be an internal saying-to-oneself that “the law requires this”) links the outward deed to a propositional content (“the law requires doing X”). That content, when shared by many people as their practical reason, becomes part of the *socially recognized meaning* of the law.

Quine’s holism also reminds us that one deviation can be accommodated by adjusting other beliefs. If a citizen deviates from the usual understanding of a rule, others might assume they know an exception or have a different interpretation. For example, if normally no vehicles are in the park but one person drives in claiming an emergency, others might update their understanding: “perhaps emergencies are implied exceptions.” The legal meaning might evolve to include that exception (some laws explicitly have necessity defenses, but even if not stated, practice might carve it out). This is normative holism: the content of the prohibition norm is refined in conjunction with a necessity norm or an informal allowance for emergencies. Each new behavior that is tolerated or communally accepted forces an adjustment in the network of normative assumptions so that everything remains coherent. Thus, citizens collectively carry out something akin to Quine’s process of adjustment of the web: if a surprising behavior doesn’t meet strong resistance, the community might revise what the law effectively is rather than treat everyone else as law-breakers.

In short, through the lens of holism and inferentialism, every instance of following a rule contributes a small piece to the larger puzzle of what inferences the community can safely make about the rule. Over time and many instances, the inferential potential of the rule – what it implies, what follows from it, how it coexists with other norms – is fleshed out. And because citizens are the ones most frequently “applying” the rules to concrete life, their collective experience provides a rich body of data for what the rule means in action. This body of data informs officials (either consciously via feedback or unconsciously via the culture that the officials themselves are part of). It also forms the backdrop against which new generations learn what the law requires. Sociologist-philosopher Philip Selznick once said, “Law is a way of life, not just a set of rules.” In the inferentialist spirit, we might say: law’s content is woven into the way of life of a community, and that way of life is constituted by countless individuals acting and interacting under the guidance of legal norms.

To avoid misunderstanding: none of this implies that if citizens misunderstand the law, the law automatically changes to their misunderstanding. There can be misalignment – that’s when officials might step in to clarify or enforce the “official” meaning. But even in such cases, the fact of widespread misunderstanding typically forces a reckoning: either the law was poorly communicated (so officials improve notice or education) or perhaps the law was out of step with social values (in which case either enforcement will be ramped up to compel alignment, or the law might be repealed or modified). In any event, citizen behavior is an essential part of the story of normativity – a gauge that the system cannot ignore without consequence.

Thus, metaethical expressivism and semantic inferentialism together paint a picture in which citizens’ normative actions are laden with meaning: they express attitudes and they participate in the holistic inference-drawing that shapes what norms effectively entail. Citizens are not infallible or supreme in this process, but neither are they irrelevant cogs. They are, we might say, **partners in the practice** of law. The final section will make this explicit and consider how recognizing citizens as partners in meaning-making can be reconciled with – and indeed strengthen – a positivist understanding of law as a social construction.

# IV. Citizens as Co-authors of Legal Normativity

**A. The Participatory Construction of Legal Meaning:** Bringing together the threads above, we arrive at a view of legal normativity as a *joint product* of official and citizen activity. Officials lay down norms and adjust them through legislation and adjudication; citizens pick up those norms, *interpret* them through action, and thereby either reinforce, refine, or occasionally resist the norms’ content. This continuous feedback loop means that, over time, what the law *practically means* in a given society is shaped by both the “official story” (the statutes, precedents, etc.) and the “unofficial story” (the pattern of societal engagement with those norms). To use a metaphor: officials write the sheet music, but the citizens’ performance can influence the tempo and even the notes that get emphasized or improvised in practice.

One way to conceptualize this is to borrow a term from linguistic theory: **pragmatic enrichment**. In language, the literal content of a sentence can be pragmatically enriched by context and usage to convey more than what is explicitly stated. Similarly, the literal text of a law can be enriched (or narrowed) by the way people actually use that law in context. We already saw examples: the “No vehicles in the park” rule’s content was enriched by the shared understanding that it doesn’t apply to bicycles. Another real-world example is how speed limit laws often acquire an understood tolerance – if the posted limit is 55 mph, everyone *knows* (in some locales) that up to 60 mph is effectively permitted by custom (and police practice). The law on the books says 55, but the law *in action* has a slightly different content: “55, with a tacit 5 mph grace.” Who created that grace? Not the legislature. It emerged from drivers’ behavior (most drove about 60), the highway patrol’s acquiescence in that behavior (not ticketing until above 60), and eventually the shared knowledge of that pattern. One might say the citizens and officials *jointly* modified the meaning of the norm. Now, a strict positivist might respond that the “real” law never changed – it’s still 55, just enforced at 60 as a matter of discretion. However, if virtually no one is punished below 60 and everyone relies on that, the distinction between a change in *meaning* and a change in *practice* blurs. For normative purposes, the rule is treated as if it were “60.” (This situation is so common that some U.S. states have even formalized a buffer by raising limits or explicitly allowing a margin, again showing feedback from practice to formal law.)

The notion of citizens as **co-authors** of law’s meaning can also be given a democratic interpretation. The law is often described as deriving authority from “We the People” (in constitutional democracies). Usually, that idea is tied to the people’s role in choosing lawmakers or in the foundational acceptance of a constitution. But here we highlight a more day-to-day, subtle way in which “the people” continue to participate in making the law what it is. They do so not by formal votes, but by how they *embody* the law. This is a kind of continuing dialogue: the legislature says, “Do X,” the public responds by largely doing X but perhaps with certain patterns or caveats, and the courts or enforcers take note and adjust interpretations, which then informs how the legislature or higher courts refine the rule, and so on. Over time, the *living law* (to use Ehrlich’s term) is the result of this dialogue.

Importantly, this view does not abandon the positivist premise that law’s existence is grounded in social facts. In fact, it doubles down on social facts – it says that not only are official acts social facts that create law, but the social facts of *compliance practices* also help determine the character of law. We are simply broadening the range of relevant social facts beyond those concerning officials alone. This is consistent with some strands of positivist thought: for instance, the source-based nature of custom as a source of law. Customary law (in international law or common law traditions) comes about precisely because of widespread practice coupled with a sense of *normativity (opinio juris)*. That is a clear example in which the practice of the community (e.g., merchants, or nations) *is* the source of the law. Legal systems often incorporate custom – but typically only when recognized by officials (a court might declare a long-standing custom to have legal force). Our argument suggests that even outside formally recognized custom, everyday practices within a framework of enacted law effectively operate like a kind of *customary gloss* on the law.

There are limits, of course. The citizenry cannot overturn a statute by simply ignoring it unless the officials themselves eventually acquiesce (e.g., via desuetude or repeal). Nor can citizens create a new law out of whole cloth without official sanction – except in domains the legal system implicitly leaves to social ordering (for example, much of ordinary social life isn’t regulated by formal law, so social norms govern it by default). Our claim is not that citizens are equal lawmakers in a formal sense, but that they are *participants in the creation of legal meaning*. They do so within the constraints set by formal law, but they have leeway in how those constraints are actualized.

**B. Modulation of Normativity:** The problem statement refers to *“construction and modulation”* of legal normativity by citizens’ act speech. We have addressed construction (how content can be built up by practice); what about modulation? Modulation implies adjusting strength, intensity, or scope. Citizens’ normative actions can modulate law’s normativity in several ways:

* **Strength of Obligation:** Social compliance can strengthen a legal norm’s perceived binding force, while lax compliance can weaken it. If everyone treats a certain minor law as crucial (for example, consistently stopping fully at every stop sign even in an empty intersection), that law’s normative presence is heightened in that community – it becomes a strong norm, possibly tied to an internalized value (like safety or respect for law). Conversely, if a law is often ignored (like speed limits or trivial regulations), even those who obey may do so half-heartedly, sensing that “this isn’t a big deal.” The normativity (in the sense of the law’s action-guiding force) is modulated downwards. Such modulation can feed into official perspectives: a police officer might use more discretion in enforcing a law everyone treats casually, effectively acknowledging that the norm’s hold is weaker.

* **Scope and Exceptions:** As we saw, citizen practice can carve out exceptions or clarify scope. This modulates *where* the norm applies. The more uniformly a community applies a rule, the broader its scope seems; heterogeneity can point to implicit exceptions. Public holidays, local festivals, or emergencies often see relaxations of certain rules (like noise ordinances or curfews) with community blessing, thus informally modulating when the law applies. Officials often codify such exceptions after the fact, but the initial modulation was by collective behavior.

* **Interpretative Emphasis:** Social action can highlight certain aspects of a law’s purpose, influencing interpretation. For example, if an anti-loitering law is generally only invoked by citizens when they feel harassed by aggressive solicitation (and they complain to police specifically in those instances), the community is signaling that the norm is really about preventing harassment, not harmless standing around. Police and courts might then interpret “loitering” in that light, focusing on the emphasized aspect (aggressive conduct), effectively modulating the law’s focus in line with public sentiment.

One might think of this through the concept of **the Rule of Recognition expanded**: What if the ultimate rule of recognition in a society not only said, “What the constitution and duly enacted statutes say is law,” but also, implicitly, “and the way these are habitually followed by society is relevant to their content”? Hart did not include that latter clause explicitly, but nothing in positivism forbids a rule of recognition from being complex. In practice, judges do sometimes consider societal consequences and practices as part of interpretive doctrines (in the U.S., the “constitutional fact” doctrine or evolving standards of decency in Eighth Amendment interpretation, etc.). These can be seen as the official system *recognizing* the normative import of societal practices. In a way, our account could be framed as an argument for a more **inclusive social rule of recognition**, one that treats the behavior of citizens under norms as part of the fabric that officials should consider when identifying what the law is. This does not collapse law into public opinion or morality; it simply acknowledges that *how the public follows the law* is one kind of social fact that can bear on what the law means.

**C. Coherence with Positivism:** It is vital to ensure coherence with the legal positivist framework. Have we smuggled in any notion of moral legitimacy or natural law by the back door? I would argue no. We have treated citizen behavior and attitudes themselves as *social facts*. The community’s normative practice is an *objective phenomenon* in the world, open to observation (albeit complex). There is no requirement in this theory that the citizens be morally *right* in their implicit interpretations, only that their collective behavior exerts an influence on the development of legal meaning. This is analogous to language: the correctness of usage is not judged by some external moral truth, but by how people actually use words. Over time, usage *determines* meaning. In law, official acts determine the baseline meaning, but usage by the public can tilt the balance in ambiguous cases or fill gaps. None of this appeals to a higher law or morality; it stays within the realm of social behavior and institutional response.

Furthermore, the distinction between *existence* and *justification* of law remains. A law doesn’t become justified just because people follow it – history shows many unjust laws were widely followed. And conversely, people may justly resist a law, but until the law is changed, their resistance doesn’t annul its existence (though it might make it ineffective). Our claim is about *meaning and content*, not moral justification. Whether citizens follow out of fear or out of moral agreement does not change what the law *institutionally is* (valid or not), but it can change what the law *practically signifies*. A tyrannical law that people obey out of fear still “exists” as law, but if people find ways to evade it through creative compliance, they might effectively narrow its content. For example, in an authoritarian regime with censorship, citizens might develop coded ways of speaking that technically obey censorship rules yet subvert their intent – a form of compliance that actually hollows out the norm’s effect. Positivistically, the censorship law is still “law,” but the social meaning of what counts as forbidden speech may shift due to citizen ingenuity. The regime’s enforcers then face the choice of cracking down (and possibly inciting more resistance) or adapting. Either way, the *social practice* has forced an evolution in how the legal norm operates.

By recognizing citizens as co-authors, we also inject a certain *normative holism* into positivism that can answer some classical critiques. Dworkin, for example, criticized Hartian positivism for failing to account for how legal principles (not just rules) guide judges, often reflecting community values. Our account could complement positivism by showing that community values and practices inform the *usage* of legal rules, which in turn can be reflected as unwritten principles or as context for interpretation. Thus, without abandoning the idea that law is ultimately what is posited by social sources, we see those sources in a broader ecosystem of meaning. This resonates with what some scholars call *“inclusive positivism”* or *“law as practice”*. It does not, however, go so far as Dworkin’s own theory that citizens have moral rights that *are* part of law regardless of official recognition – we stop short of that, sticking to descriptive social influence rather than moral insistence.

One might raise a concern: if citizens effectively shape law, does this mean the law becomes uncertain or variable from community to community or over time? Potentially, yes – but that is already true to an extent. Laws do mean slightly different things in different social contexts (think of common law systems where local customs affect the application of general doctrines, or even differences in how strictly laws are enforced in different regions). Positivism acknowledges that law is a social construct, so it can vary with social facts. Our view just adds that one relevant set of social facts is the pattern of citizen action. If anything, paying attention to citizen practice can *increase* the predictability and effectiveness of law, because it grounds law in the reality of how norms are lived. A norm that is conceptually clear but practically ignored is not really guiding behavior; a norm that is slightly adjusted to fit practice might actually guide better. In jurisprudence, Lon Fuller (a critic of strict positivism) argued that law’s efficacy and morality are intertwined through principles like congruence between official action and announced rules. Here we echo a bit of Fuller’s insight: when there is congruence between *societal practice* and *official rules*, law’s guidance function is strongest. And achieving congruence may require officials to heed societal practice (and vice versa).

**D. Examples Revisited:** To illustrate co-authorship concretely, consider a few domains:

* *Commercial Law and Custom:* The Uniform Commercial Code in the U.S. explicitly allows trade “usages” to inform contract interpretation. Merchants’ practices (citizens in their business capacity) literally become part of the law of contracts. This is a formal acknowledgment of citizen norm-contribution. It reflects the reality that the content of obligations in commerce often arises from what people normally do or expect.

* *Constitutional Norms and Public Understanding:* Concepts like “equal protection” or “due process” are not static. Public movements and changing social norms have influenced their interpretation. For instance, conceptions of equality evolved with the civil rights movement; by the time courts recognized new implications (like racial integration or same-sex marriage rights), they were partly responding to shifts in public ethos and practices (interracial relationships became common and accepted by most citizens before *Loving v. Virginia* struck down anti-miscegenation laws; same-sex couples lived openly in committed relationships before *Obergefell* recognized marriage rights). In those instances, citizens’ normative practices pioneered a meaning (e.g., marriage as a union not inherently gender-specific) that law eventually caught up to. A positivist can say: the law changed when the court ruled; but the interpretation that the court found persuasive was conditioned by societal developments.

* *Criminal Law Enforcement:* If juries of citizens regularly refuse to convict for certain offenses (say, minor drug possession), their action – jury nullification in effect – sends a powerful message that the community does not attach the intended stigma to that offense. Lawmakers and prosecutors might respond by reducing penalties or not bringing such charges. Here the citizens (as jurors, which is a quasi-official role but drawn from citizenry) act as a valve injecting community normative judgment into the system. The resulting legal norms (like more lenient laws) are shaped by that citizen input.

These examples underscore that citizens are not only subjects of law but also *subjects in law’s story*. They are part of what gives law its content and force at any given time.

# V. Implications and Conclusion

Recognizing citizens’ normative actions as “act speech” that contributes to legal normativity carries implications for legal theory and practice. For legal theory, it suggests a more **dynamic model of legal positivism** in which the social facts that constitute law include a wider array of practices. It invites jurisprudence to pay closer analytical attention to *compliance* as a concept – not just whether people obey, but *how* they obey and what understandings they display in so doing. This could enrich theories of the rule of recognition or legal change by incorporating a bottom-up dimension. For instance, one might theorize a mechanism by which persistent patterns of societal behavior generate a defeasible presumption of legal change (a kind of *descriptive jurisprudence* of how law evolves outside of formal amendments).

For legal practice, acknowledging this co-authorship might encourage **legal decision-makers to engage with the community’s experience**. Judges often face choices in interpreting ambiguous statutes: a more technocratic approach might stick to textual or original meanings, whereas a more pragmatic approach might consider contemporary social context. Our account provides a philosophical justification for the latter – not as a naive “populism,” but as a recognition that the community’s use of the law is part of what the law actually is. In administrative and regulatory law, agencies could consider compliance patterns as informative feedback, not just a compliance rate to improve but as indicating how regulations could be better tailored to real-world conditions.

Another implication touches on **legitimacy**. When citizens see themselves as having a stake and role in shaping the law (even informally), it might strengthen the perceived legitimacy of the legal system. They are not simply being governed; they are also helping govern – through the medium of normative action. This resonates with republican or democratic ideals of self-governance, but translates it into the register of everyday behavior. Conversely, if officials disregard widespread normative practices without compelling reasons, they risk a disconnect that can delegitimize the law in the eyes of the public. A classic example was Prohibition in the United States: the law forbidding alcohol met with such broad non-compliance that it lost legitimacy and had to be repealed. One could interpret that as the citizenry effectively *vetoing* a law by mass act speech, saying “this norm is not accepted here,” a message the legal system ultimately heeded.

It is important to draw a line: this theory does not endorse anarchy or mob rule. It doesn’t say any citizen action is automatically law-creative. Rather, it identifies a subtle, ongoing process by which *stable* patterns of behavior and *shared* understandings among the populace seep into the fabric of legal norms. It requires some degree of convergence and persistence – akin to customary law formation. Isolated flouting or individual quirks won’t constitute “act speech” influential enough to change normativity; it’s the concerted or common practice that matters, just as language changes through communal shifts, not one person’s idiolect.

By possibly departing from a strictly hierarchical conception of norm-making, we produce a more *coherent and well-supported* account of legal meaning. The coherence arises from aligning our legal theory with the realities of legal practice and language: meaning is use, norms live in their application, and law is a social practice through and through. We have not, in the end, contradicted the positivist separation of is and ought – we’ve expanded the “is” of law to include what the community is doing with the law. And we’ve left the “ought” of law – the moral critique of laws or the justification for obeying – to be considered on its own merits (though a richer understanding of citizen participation might well inform theories of political obligation or obedience in promising ways, by showing people often treat law as *their own* which could morally justify compliance beyond mere fear or habit).

In conclusion, citizens’ law-abiding behavior is far from a rote submission to authority; it is an active ingredient in the life of the law. When citizens act in accordance with legal norms, they do not simply reflect law’s normativity – they *constitute* it, each action an instance of the norm given flesh, each pattern of action a chapter in the evolving narrative of what the law means. Their “act speech” can affirm, clarify, or quietly transform the norms that govern them. This insight urges us to view the legal system not solely as a structure of commands emanating from above, but as a **practice of mutual engagement**, where meaning is made in the space between official pronouncement and lived experience. Law, under this view, is truly a *community project*: a language of conduct that we all, officials and ordinary citizens alike, speak together.

**Justifying Act Speech Theory Beyond Legal Positivism and Legal Realism**

The theory of *Act Speech* advances a novel account of legal existence by anchoring legal normativity not in propositional attitudes or rule-following behavior, but in expressive actions that instantiate and sustain legal meaning. In doing so, it seeks to resolve foundational tensions between legal positivism, legal realism, and interpretivist theories such as that of Ronald Dworkin. What distinguishes Act Speech is its constitutive thesis: that certain institutionalized actions function not merely as vehicles for expressing legal meaning, but as the very acts by which legal norms are brought into being.

Legal positivism, particularly as articulated by H.L.A. Hart, grounds the existence of law in social practices and rule-based convergence among officials. Yet the rule of recognition, which Hart posits as the foundational conventional rule for identifying valid laws, leaves unexplained how such conventions themselves acquire normative authority. Hart contends that the internal point of view suffices, yet critics have noted that this invocation of acceptance does not account for the dynamic and performative dimensions of legal life. The *Act Speech* framework offers an explanatory advance by showing how legal practices are normatively constituted through public, recognizable, and institutionally ratified expressive acts. It replaces Hart's epistemically opaque "acceptance" with a more structured account of how recognition operates within socially embedded systems of performative interaction.

Legal realism, on the other hand, correctly identifies that the application and development of law are contingent upon the discretionary actions of judges and officials. However, it often collapses normative authority into sociological facticity or behavioral regularity. The *Act Speech* model avoids this pitfall by treating expressive legal actions not as mere social outcomes but as normatively inflected performances. The theory acknowledges contingency and indeterminacy while preserving the possibility of normative evaluation by anchoring legal meaning in the successful expression of institutionally regulated acts. These acts are neither reducible to psychological intentions nor to behavioral regularities, but instead depend on the felicity conditions analogous to those found in speech act theory (Austin; Searle), extended into legal practice.

Interpretivist theories such as Dworkin's present a powerful challenge to positivist accounts by arguing that law is best understood as an interpretive enterprise, wherein judges seek the morally best justification of legal practices. Yet interpretivism faces the difficulty of anchoring legal obligation in a shared practice without collapsing into either subjectivism or moral realism. *Act Speech* preserves Dworkin's insight about the meaning-laden nature of legal practice while avoiding the epistemological burdens of moral objectivity. It grounds legal normativity in publicly observable acts that satisfy criteria of institutional intelligibility and uptake, thereby offering an intersubjective yet non-metaphysical account of normativity.

In sum, the *Act Speech* theory provides a philosophically robust alternative that integrates the strengths of prior theories while addressing their weaknesses. It affirms the performative constitution of law, clarifies the mechanisms of social recognition, and provides a conceptually precise framework for understanding legal existence as dependent upon expressive acts that are both institutional and normative. By reframing recognition as an expressive rather than merely epistemic phenomenon, *Act Speech* yields a richer, more actionable account of legal normativity consistent with the best traditions of analytic jurisprudence.

# Law’s Existence and Convergent Belief: An Analytic Inquiry

## Introduction

Is the **existence of law** ultimately grounded in a shared mindset? A provocative thesis in contemporary analytic legal philosophy posits that a legal system – and particularly its *rule of recognition* – hinges on an **epistemic convergence of belief** among legal actors. In other words, judges, officials, and other participants must broadly **agree on certain fundamental criteria and values** (for example, a core principle like *human dignity*) before we can say that “law” exists or is recognized as such. This convergence-based view challenges the classic *legal positivist* account articulated by H.L.A. Hart, which grounds law’s validity in social practice and acceptance rather than in any deep normative consensus. The question is whether a convergence of belief – especially about moral values – provides a **stronger foundation for law’s existence** than Hart’s conventional model of social acceptance.

This inquiry reviews contemporary Anglo-American analytic jurisprudence to **support or critique the convergence thesis**. It examines whether theories built on shared epistemic commitments offer a compelling alternative to Hart’s view, and how they withstand critiques by leading scholars like **Joseph Raz**, **Brian Tamanaha**, **Jeremy Waldron**, **Mark Greenberg**, and others. In doing so, we will also consider the relevance of **epistemological holism** (à la Quine) – the idea that our beliefs form an interconnected web – and whether such holism buttresses the convergence-based theory or exposes it to further vulnerabilities. The goal is to develop a structured philosophical argument, in the style of Dworkin or Sunstein, that either **defends** the convergence-based view of legal existence or **reconstructs** it in light of these critiques.

## The Convergence Thesis: Law and Shared Beliefs

At its core, the convergence thesis asserts that **legal validity depends on shared epistemic commitments**. Legal actors must converge in their beliefs about what counts as law, which may include agreement on **fundamental principles**. On this view, the law is not just a set of enacted rules; it is sustained by a *collective mindset* or **common knowledge** among officials – a tacit or explicit agreement about basic legal norms and sources. For example, judges and lawmakers might share a **commitment to the authority of a constitution or to abstract values like human dignity**, and this convergence of belief forms the backbone of the legal system’s legitimacy. In Hart’s terminology, such convergence is akin to officials accepting the rule of recognition from an “internal point of view,” treating it as a **common standard for identifying law**. Importantly, the convergence thesis often **goes further** than Hart by suggesting that agreement may extend to substantive values (like dignity or justice), not merely to formal sources of law.

* **Hart’s insight on convergence:** Even Hart’s positivism recognized an element of convergent practice. He famously argued that a legal system exists when its officials **concur in accepting fundamental secondary rules** (rules of recognition, change, adjudication) as standards of official behavior. The rule of recognition itself, Hart wrote, is a *social rule* arising from the **“convergent practice”** of officials – a stable pattern in which officials generally agree on criteria for legal validity and *critically reflect* on deviations. This convergence of attitudes (shared acceptance of, say, the constitution as supreme law) is what *constitutes* the rule of recognition. In that sense, Hart’s model already relies on a **social convergence** (albeit a thin one) among legal actors.

* **Beyond Hart – normative convergence:** The new convergence-based theories build on this idea but emphasize **epistemic and normative convergence**. They argue that it’s not only agreement on *procedural criteria* that matters, but also a shared belief in certain **core values** that imbue the legal system with coherence and moral legitimacy. For instance, many modern constitutions worldwide enshrine *human dignity* as a foundational value. One could argue that the very *existence* of law in those systems depends on a **common commitment to human dignity** among judges and other officials. This commitment guides interpretation and fills in gaps, effectively serving as a higher-order rule of recognition. Indeed, comparative studies of constitutional discourse find that *human dignity* has emerged as a “constitutional touchstone” through a **convergence of judicial reasoning across jurisdictions**. Courts around the world increasingly invoke dignity in tandem, indicating a **transnational epistemic community** converging on this value.

* **Example – dignity as a shared fundamental:** In practice, judges often treat human dignity as a **globally shared principle**, borrowing foreign case law that upholds dignity to justify their own decisions. By appealing to dignity as a *universal value*, they imply an **underlying convergence**: a “basic ground of commonality” that transcends local law. For example, a national court might strike down degrading punishment by citing how courts in other nations did the same in the name of dignity. Such reasoning *“does not make sense unless \[dignity] is regarded… as something the meaning and value of which transcend local context and constitute a commonality”* across legal systems. In other words, judges behave as if there is an **epistemic consensus** that every legal system, at its best, respects human dignity. This illustrates how a convergence of belief about a core concept can operate as an *unwritten rule* recognizing certain norms as legally fundamental.

**Claim:** Proponents of the convergence thesis claim that this kind of broad-based agreement fortifies the concept of law. When officials *collectively affirm* a deep value or framework, it provides a more resilient and normatively appealing basis for legal authority than a mere habit of following rules. Such convergence might also explain how law maintains continuity: even as particular laws change, a common bedrock of belief (e.g. commitment to fair process or human dignity) persists and holds the system together.

## Hart’s Social Acceptance Model vs. Convergence Theory

To evaluate the strength of convergence-based theories, it is crucial to compare them to **conventional legal positivism**, especially Hart’s influential model:

* **Hart’s model (social acceptance):** In *The Concept of Law*, H.L.A. Hart argued that the foundation of any legal system is a **social rule accepted by officials** – the *rule of recognition*. This rule specifies the criteria by which valid laws are identified (for example, “enacted by Parliament and not contravening the Constitution”). Hart emphasized that the rule of recognition exists as a matter of **social fact**: it is effective because officials actually use and accept it in practice. Crucially, its authority **does not depend on moral agreement** or on its justice; it depends on the **convergent conduct and attitudes** of officials who treat it as binding. Hart thus offered a **descriptive, value-neutral** account: as long as officials broadly converge in recognizing certain sources of law, a legal system exists – regardless of whether the officials share deeper ethical beliefs. This is often called the *conventionality thesis*: legal validity stems from convention (social practice) rather than moral truth.

* **Convergence theory’s addition:** Convergence-based theories agree with Hart that **shared acceptance** is key, but they contend Hart’s view is *under-inclusive*. They argue that merely converging on a checklist of sources (constitution, statutes, etc.) might not fully explain legal authority or stability. Instead, **law’s existence may require a richer convergence of belief**, including some **normative or epistemic alignment** on *why* those sources are valid or *how* they should be interpreted. For example, Hart’s model would say the U.S. Constitution is law because officials accept it as the ultimate rule; a convergence theorist might add that **officials also converge in a general belief in democratic legitimacy and fundamental rights, which gives life to the constitutional text**. Without some such deeper agreement, the fear is that the rule of recognition is a **hollow formality** – a fragile rule that could collapse under disagreement or novel crises. In short, convergence theories seek to **strengthen the glue** of the system by incorporating shared epistemic commitments (like commitment to dignity, justice, or rule-of-law values) into the criteria for legal validity or the identity of the legal system.

* **Stronger explanatory power?:** Does this make convergence theories a *stronger alternative* to Hart’s positivism? Arguably yes, in some respects. They claim to explain certain features of law that Hart’s model struggles with. For instance, Hart acknowledged that his rule of recognition may have an “open texture” at the margins (officials might disagree about hard cases or about whether a principle counts as law). Convergence theorists respond that *what keeps law working despite such disputes* is an underlying **epistemic holism among officials** – a generally shared sense of mission or value that guides them through uncertainty. If judges largely agree that *“the law, properly understood, respects human dignity and reason”*, then even when positive rules are vague, they converge on outcomes consistent with that shared understanding. This could elucidate why, for example, disparate legal systems often reach similar **“family resemblant” solutions on moral issues** (cruel punishments, equality, etc.) – something mere source-based rules might not predict. It also aligns with observations that **concepts like ‘dignity’ achieve consensus as legal principles across cultures**, functioning as common reference points.

* **Risk of moral content:** On the other hand, adding *moral or epistemic content* to the rule of recognition edges closer to **natural law** or Dworkinian theories. It means abandoning the sharp positivist separation between what law *is* (social fact) and what law *ought to be* (moral judgment). Convergence theories therefore face a challenge: they must incorporate moral **beliefs** into the existence conditions of law **without undermining objectivity** or falling into parochialism. If the “law exists only if officials believe in human dignity,” what if they do not? Does a tyrannical regime with no such shared belief **lack a legal system**, or is it just a morally bad legal system? Hart would say the latter (law exists, but it’s evil law). A pure convergence theorist might be committed to the more radical claim that *real law* cannot exist without a degree of moral consensus (an echo of Fuller’s view that extreme evil or disorder fails to count as “law”). This is a point of contention: whether convergence on *moral principles* is **constitutive of legal validity** or merely something that makes a legal system morally better.

In sum, convergence-based accounts aim to **enrich Hart’s social fact model** by weaving in shared epistemic commitments as part of law’s foundation. They promise a **more normatively appealing** picture (law as a product of principled agreement, not just might or habit) and potentially a more *unified* explanation of legal authority. But this very enrichment provokes searching critiques from positivists and others, who worry about the **practical reality of convergence** and the **normative paradoxes** it may introduce. We turn now to those critiques.

## Challenges and Critiques from Raz, Waldron, Tamanaha, Greenberg, and Others

Several prominent jurists and philosophers have challenged the convergence thesis or aspects of it, either in defense of traditional positivism or from other theoretical standpoints. We consider each in turn and how their critiques bear on the idea that law’s existence requires epistemic convergence:

### Joseph Raz: Authority and the Exclusion of Morality

**Joseph Raz**, a leading legal positivist, offers a forceful critique grounded in his theory of *legal authority*. Raz contends that for law to **claim authority** over its subjects, it must be possible to identify legal norms *without recourse to contested moral judgments*. In Raz’s view, the **validity of a norm should hinge exclusively on its social sources** (who enacted it, which procedures were followed), not on whether officials *believe* it aligns with moral values. This is encapsulated in Raz’s **“sources thesis,”** which holds that all law is determined by social facts alone.

* **Against moral criteria in recognition:** A convergence-based theory that includes moral consensus (e.g. agreement on human dignity) as part of law’s existence *violates Raz’s sources thesis*. Raz argues that *only* a rule of recognition employing **source-based criteria** (such as *“enacted by Parliament,” “decided by a court”*) can possess genuine authority. Why? Because if officials must also agree on **moral criteria** (like “consistent with human dignity”) to identify valid law, then citizens and courts must engage in moral reasoning to figure out what the law requires. That, according to Raz, **undermines law’s authority**: *“if what the law tells someone to do is not intelligible independent of the moral and other reasons on which it is based, then the law cannot possibly perform a service for its subjects.”* In other words, law is supposed to **give subjects content-independent reasons** for action, simplifying their moral deliberations. But a convergence theory that builds in morality makes the law’s directives **“inseparable” from moral debate**, eroding the very point of having authoritative rules. For Raz, this is a decisive flaw: by insisting on shared moral belief as a condition of legal validity, convergence theories would rob law of the *practical function of authority* that sets it apart from ordinary social discourse.

* **Authority vs. convergence:** Furthermore, Raz might question the factual premise of convergence. Even within a single legal system, officials often deeply **disagree about moral values**. Consider a supreme court split 5-4 on whether dignity or liberty is more fundamental in a case – the judges don’t have a fully convergent moral belief, yet the legal system clearly continues. Raz would say the law *remains law* thanks to the **pedigree of the decision (majority vote, constitution as authority)**, not because the judges converged on moral truth. Indeed, Raz’s *exclusive positivism* holds that whenever moral reasoning is necessary to ascertain law, we have left the domain of **identifying law** and entered the domain of **evaluating law**, which is separate. He would likely argue that convergence theorists **collapse this distinction**, thereby conflating what *law is* with what *law ought to be*.

In summary, Raz defends Hart’s basic separation of legal validity from moral consensus, insisting that **social fact convergence (and only on sources)** is what keeps law authoritative. He sees convergence-based views (especially those importing values like dignity into the rule of recognition) as a **threat to the clarity and authority of law**. Law, for Raz, should **channel disagreement into democratic or legal procedures**, not require *prior* consensus on controversial values. This critique presses the convergence thesis on a fundamental dilemma: can law be both *authoritatively binding* and *grounded in shared moral belief*? Raz is skeptical that it can be both.

### Jeremy Waldron: Disagreement and Democracy

**Jeremy Waldron** offers a different angle of critique, focusing on the reality of persistent **disagreement** in law and its value in a democratic society. Waldron famously questions whether Hart’s *rule of recognition* – the keystone of any convergence theory – is even necessary or useful in complex modern systems. In *“Who Needs Rules of Recognition?”* he argues that much of the work attributed to a unified rule of recognition is either done by other mechanisms (like rules of change, e.g., legislative procedures) or **“not done at all (and doesn't have to be done)”**. This skepticism extends to the idea that officials actually converge on a single set of fundamental beliefs.

* **Fact of disagreement:** Waldron observes that, particularly in the United States, **officials do *not* evince a neat convergence** on constitutional foundations or interpretive principles. Judges, legislators, and scholars **debate fiercely** about the proper methods of interpretation (originalism vs. living constitutionalism), the scope of rights, and even about what the ultimate criteria of legal validity are (is an unconstitutional statute “no law”? who decides?). This reality suggests that the supposed convergence (the rule of recognition) might be *fragmented or indeterminate*. *“We get by without a determinate rule of recognition”* in such cases, Waldron notes, and perhaps that is *“quite liberating.”* It frees us from obsessing over a single foundational rule and allows for **healthy pluralism** in legal reasoning. By extension, a theory that law’s existence hinges on **epistemic convergence of belief** seems descriptively **inapt**: modern legal systems tolerate, and even thrive on, a degree of fundamental disagreement. Convergence on something like “human dignity” might exist at a very abstract level, but when it comes to specifics, officials often diverge (one judge’s notion of dignity may conflict with another’s concept of liberty or religion). Waldron would likely argue that this **disagreement is not fatal to law**; instead, it’s part of how law works in a free society – through argument, contestation, and majority decision, not unanimous epistemic accord.

* **Democratic values:** Normatively, Waldron cherishes the **idea of a dynamic legal system** where disputes are resolved through institutional processes rather than pre-fixed consensus. He might worry that convergence theories overemphasize *harmony among elites (officials)* at the cost of neglecting the **procedural legitimacy** of how law settles disagreements. If we expect judges to all converge in belief, do we sideline minority views or dissenting interpretive theories too readily? Waldron’s democratic jurisprudence values **open debate** over *assumed consensus*. A convergence-based law, especially one centered on a grand moral principle, could risk becoming what Waldron calls **“overmoralized”** – turning every legal question into a philosophical one and perhaps undermining the stability that comes from following established procedure even amid disagreement.

In essence, Waldron challenges the convergence thesis by highlighting that **law persists through disagreement**. He implies that seeking too much convergence (especially on substantive values) might be neither realistic nor desirable. Instead of an *epistemic convergence*, he sees the rule of recognition (if it exists at all) as perhaps a *procedural consensus* (“we will treat duly enacted statutes as law”), but **nothing more rigid**. And even that, he says, can be loosened – for example, common-law systems operate with *fuzzy, evolving criteria* and still function. Waldron thus presses convergence theorists to account for the **value of pluralism** and the fact that law can accommodate profound, ongoing **disagreements at its core**.

### Brian Tamanaha: Sociological and Cross-Cultural Critique

**Brian Z. Tamanaha** approaches the issue from a **general jurisprudence and socio-legal** perspective. He is known for urging that our concept of law be **descriptive and culturally inclusive** – not tied too tightly to the peculiarities of any one legal tradition. In his work *A General Jurisprudence of Law and Society*, Tamanaha critiques Hart and other analytical positivists for being **“not general enough and not descriptive enough.”** He notes that Hart’s model, while powerful for modern Western legal systems, *“was not capable of accounting for the many variations of legal phenomena in different cultures and times”*. This critique has implications for convergence-based theories:

* **The trap of parochialism:** A convergence-of-belief theory might surreptitiously **import a particular worldview** (such as a Western liberal commitment to human dignity or rights) as a condition for “law.” Tamanaha would caution that such a move risks writing a **cultural bias** into our definition of law. If, for example, we claimed that a shared belief in human dignity is necessary for law’s existence, what do we say about historical legal systems that *did not recognize “human dignity” in our modern sense* (say, slaveholding regimes)? Were they not law at all? Tamanaha’s **legal pluralism** perspective suggests that law can exist in **diverse forms**, including ones grounded in religion, customs, or power structures that don’t neatly align with liberal values. A theory demanding convergence on specific concepts might **exclude** those as “not really law,” which Tamanaha would view as an *analytic error*. He emphasizes a **“folk” conception of law** rooted in what people of a society call law, not what philosophers wish law would ideally be.

* **Social-fact flexibility:** Tamanaha actually sides with Hart in the sense that **social acceptance** (some form of it) is crucial – but he wants to broaden *who* must accept and *what* counts as acceptance. He argues that Hart focused too much on officials of a centralized state. In many societies, law-like norms exist through **informal convergence** among community members or multiple sources of authority. If convergence-based theories are too rigid (e.g., requiring convergence on a single national Grundnorm or on an abstract value), they might **fail to capture pluralistic or decentralized legal orders**. For instance, in some countries the legal system is a patchwork of state law, tribal law, and religious law; expecting a single convergent belief among all officials is unrealistic. Tamanaha might say that law in such contexts is better understood through **multiple, overlapping convergences**—thinner, context-specific acceptances rather than one grand consensus.

* **Value-neutral vs. value-laden:** Tamanaha also observes that Hart’s concept, despite aiming to be value-neutral, wasn’t entirely so. But he warns against overtly building in *moral values* as definitional of law. Instead, he proposes a **“socio-legal positivism”** that retains focus on what people **actually do and believe** about law in their social setting. A convergence theory could fit this if carefully framed (for example, saying *whatever fundamental principles the relevant community converges on*), but often the convergence thesis is presented in terms of *our* ideals (like dignity). Tamanaha would likely encourage convergence theorists to **empirically verify** the claimed consensus. Do judges truly share the same conception of dignity? Or are we projecting philosophical unity where practice shows divergence? If the latter, the convergence thesis might be *normative aspiration* rather than *descriptive reality*.

In short, Tamanaha’s critique urges caution that convergence-based accounts **not become too narrow or ethnocentric**. Law has existed in forms that do not neatly map onto any one cherished value or epistemic stance. A strong theory of law’s existence should account for **variation and pluralism**. Convergence, if it is to be the linchpin, may need to be understood in a minimal or abstract sense (perhaps convergence on *the idea of having a legal order*, rather than on any single value). Otherwise, the theory might **fail Tamanaha’s test** of generality and descriptive adequacy.

### Mark Greenberg: Moral Determinants and Explanatory Critique

**Mark Greenberg** provides a sophisticated critique from the intersection of legal philosophy and moral philosophy. He is known for the **Moral Impact Theory of law**, which proposes that the content of the law is the set of moral obligations that result from the actions of legal institutions. While Greenberg’s theory is in one sense even more *normative* than the convergence thesis, he actually mounts a critique against simple positivist or convergence accounts for **failing to explain why certain social facts produce legal obligations**.

* **Social facts vs. reasons:** Greenberg argues it is *“a mistake to hold that legal facts are determined solely by social facts.”* This directly challenges any theory (like Hart’s) that a convergence of official practice (a social fact) is enough to explain the existence and content of law. For Greenberg, there must be a **rational or moral bridge** from the social facts to the legal norms. If officials converge on a rule of recognition, that is a fact – but *why should that fact make certain rules legally binding*? In his critique, Greenberg suggests that **Hartian positivism lacks an explanatory element**: it makes it *true* that some norm is law, but not *intelligible* why that norm gives anyone a reason for action. He insists the connection between legal practice and legal obligation be **“rationally intelligible”**, not just a brute fact.

* **Convergence and rationality:** A pure convergence thesis might fall into the same problem if it just says “because everyone (or every official) believes X is a fundamental legal norm, therefore it is law.” Greenberg (and others like him) would ask: is there a **moral justification** for that step? If the convergence is on a value like human dignity, the theory has a better story to tell—perhaps the officials’ convergence on dignity *helps to morally justify* the legal system. But if the convergence is simply on an arbitrary rule or on their own say-so, it seems **insufficient**. Greenberg’s own view is that legal institutions alter our moral obligations; thus, the **moral impact** of what officials do is the law. From that perspective, a mere convergence of belief among officials, unless it somehow **tracks moral truth**, might not determine legal obligations at all. In fact, Greenberg might commend convergence theorists for at least **seeking a normative dimension** (like dignity) rather than Hart’s austere model – but he would press further and ask whether the convergent beliefs of officials align with the **actual moral impact** of the law. If there is a divergence (say officials all believe in a principle, but that principle doesn’t actually produce the best moral outcomes), Greenberg would likely side with the *objective moral impact* over the *subjective convergence*.

* **Explanatory challenge:** One of Greenberg’s pointed criticisms is that a rule of recognition (and by extension any convergence-based validation) *“cannot provide a reason why some kinds of social fact count as legal sources whilst others do not.”* It merely **posits** that “we accept these sources.” This, he argues, lacks explanatory power – it’s almost circular, saying “these facts count as law because we believe they do.” In a recent analysis (critiquing an “international rule of recognition”), a scholar following Greenberg notes that relying on *“a convergence of official attitudes and behavior”* as the ultimate basis of law leaves us with an **irrational foundation**: we still wonder *why* those attitudes should count. A convergence-based theory must therefore answer Greenberg’s challenge by showing that the convergence of belief is not a mere happenstance but has a **reason-giving force**. Perhaps the argument would be that *because* officials converge on *dignity* or *democracy*, the laws they recognize are imbued with moral legitimacy, and that legitimacy is the reason citizens should obey. Greenberg might respond that then the real work is being done by **dignity or democracy’s moral force**, not by the convergence per se. In other words, unless convergence is tied to independent moral merit, it doesn’t automatically confer normativity.

In summary, Greenberg’s critique pushes convergence theorists toward a more **holistic moral explanation**. It’s not enough that officials believe the same thing; what they believe must be part of a **coherent moral order** that explains legal obligations. His work cautions that any account of law’s existence that stops at social consensus (no matter how epistemically rich) might be leaving out the crucial element of **moral justification** or **reason-giving**. This moves the debate into the territory of whether an *epistemic* convergence (what officials believe) needs to reflect an *objective* convergence (what is morally right or best) for the theory to truly hold up.

### Other Perspectives and Critiques

Beyond these four figures, other legal philosophers have weighed in on aspects relevant to convergence:

* **Ronald Dworkin’s interpretive approach** can be seen as both supportive and critical. Dworkin famously criticized Hart’s model, arguing that law includes moral principles that *“flow”* from an interpretive understanding of legal practice, not just from explicit social rules. In *Law’s Empire*, Dworkin conceives law as an interpretive concept: judges collectively construct law by presenting their legal practice in its *best moral light*. This is **not exactly a convergence of belief** in the straightforward sense – judges often disagree passionately. However, Dworkin’s ideal of *law as integrity* does imagine a kind of **coherent narrative** underlying the law, as if the community were converging on a principled story. One might say Dworkin seeks a **theoretical convergence** (everyone *acting* as if they accepted the same fundamental moral narrative), even if actual beliefs diverge. He would likely applaud the convergence thesis for noticing that **mere social facts are incomplete**, but he would insist that the *content* of any convergent belief must come from a process of principled interpretation, not a predetermined value like dignity. Indeed, Dworkin might warn that focusing on one value (dignity) is too **simplistic** – law’s deep consensus is more complex, a matter of *integrity* across many principles and past decisions, which judges continually debate.

* **Scott Shapiro’s Planning Theory** offers another intriguing take. Shapiro agrees with Hart that law is ultimately rooted in social practice, but he refines this in *Legality* by suggesting that the rule of recognition is part of a **shared plan** among officials. On this view, officials don’t necessarily share moral beliefs, but they share a plan (a set of understood roles and procedures) for running the legal system. This is a **convergence of intentions** rather than belief in truth. A plan can accommodate disagreement on substance as long as everyone agrees on how to decide and who gets to decide. Shapiro thus might say: *yes, convergence is crucial, but it’s convergence on a plan or function*. Introducing *values like dignity* into the plan is possible (if the plan explicitly says so), but not necessary. And if not all officials follow that sub-plan, the system can still function. For convergence theorists, Shapiro’s work suggests the need to clarify *what* is converged upon – a strategy (plan) or a truth? Shapiro would likely favor the former, keeping convergence thinner and more procedural to allow a stable framework that operators can buy into despite moral divergence.

* **Inclusivist vs. Exclusivist Positivists:** Within positivism, there’s a known split: *inclusive positivists* (like Jules Coleman or Wilfrid Waluchow) argue that a rule of recognition **can include moral criteria** if the practice so dictates (for example, a constitution might say no law is valid if it violates human dignity, and if officials accept this, it becomes a criterion of validity). *Exclusive positivists* (like Raz) reject that. The convergence thesis, especially “with respect to human dignity,” sounds akin to an **inclusive positivist** claim – that legal validity might partly depend on adherence to a moral principle due to convergent acceptance. Inclusive positivists defend this as **entirely consistent with positivism**: the ultimate basis is still social acceptance (the officials accept a moral criterion). The **critique from exclusivists** we already covered with Raz – they think this compromises authority. Inclusive theorists respond that as long as it’s a social fact that officials accept the moral criterion, it’s positivism; and if the moral criterion is only *one* of several factors, perhaps it doesn’t fatally undermine guidance. The debate here indicates that even *within* convergence on rule of recognition, there’s **disagreement about including values**. So a convergence theory must navigate this: is the convergence purely on **source-based rules** (which is safer but more Hart-like), or on **substantive values** (riskier but normatively richer)?

Each of these perspectives enriches the critical conversation. They collectively raise issues of **practical reality (do officials really converge?), normative justification (does convergence give reasons or just reflect them?), and conceptual clarity (what exactly must converge?).** With these critiques in mind, we can better assess the viability of the convergence thesis and whether epistemological holism offers reinforcement or reveals cracks.

## Epistemological Holism: Support or Vulnerability?

The notion of **epistemological holism**, especially as advanced by W\.V.O. Quine, holds that our beliefs form an interdependent web wherein **no single belief can be tested or confirmed in isolation**. Instead, the entire network of beliefs faces the “tribunal of experience” together – adjustments in one part of the web can reverberate through others. Applying this idea to jurisprudence: if legal rules and principles are part of an interconnected belief system of a community, then **law’s existence may indeed depend on a broad coherence of beliefs** among legal actors. This could be invoked *in favor* of the convergence thesis, but it also introduces potential *vulnerabilities*.

* **Holistic support for convergence:** If we take Quine’s holism seriously, *identifying law is an epistemic exercise* much like identifying scientific truth – it relies on multiple assumptions and background commitments. For officials to **recognize something as law**, they implicitly rely on a whole web of beliefs about the political system, the nature of authority, justice, language, etc. On a Quinean view, the rule of recognition itself might be seen as **one strand in the web of belief** that legal actors hold. Its content (e.g., “the constitution is supreme law”) is tied to other strands (beliefs in the constitution’s legitimacy, in the importance of dignity or democracy, in the role of courts, etc.). Thus, achieving **convergence on the rule of recognition** might require a fairly wide **overlap in the broader web of beliefs**. In other words, epistemological holism suggests that a *narrow agreement* on one rule is unstable; officials also need to share many surrounding understandings for that rule to function. This could explain why **convergence on fundamental values (like human dignity) could bolster a legal system**: it means the officials’ webs of belief overlap in crucial areas, reducing the chances of radical divergence elsewhere. The holist perspective thus lends theoretical support to the idea that **law rests on a bedrock of common worldview**. In the extreme, one might say a legal system exists only if there is a **sufficiently dense cluster of mutually coherent beliefs** among officials about law and justice – a thoroughly holistic convergence.

* **Incompletely theorized agreements:** In practice, legal actors often agree on outcomes or broad principles while disagreeing on theoretical justifications. This resonates with Cass Sunstein’s idea of **“incompletely theorized agreements.”** Judges may converge on *a decision* or *a minimal principle* (e.g., “cruel punishments are unconstitutional because they offend human dignity”) without consensus on deeper philosophical foundations. Holism acknowledges that people can share some beliefs and not others; the web of belief need not be identical for each person. **Partial convergence** can be enough for practical purposes if the contested beliefs can be compartmentalized. Sunstein’s observation highlights a strategy for convergence-based theories: they might focus on achieving **agreement at the level necessary for coordination**, while leaving finer moral or theoretical points open. This pragmatic convergence aligns with Quine’s view that we adjust the web at its fringes to protect core beliefs. Legal officials might treat certain core propositions (like basic human rights) as fixed, convergent points, and reconcile disagreements by tweaking less fundamental beliefs. In this way, **holism supports convergence by showing how a community can maintain core consensus amid peripheral diversity**.

* **Holistic vulnerability – lack of foundations:** On the flip side, Quinean holism famously **denies any infallible foundation** (no belief is beyond revision). If applied to law, this means even the rule of recognition or fundamental principles are, in principle, **revisable elements of the web**. A convergence-based theory might then be vulnerable to **dramatic shifts**: if enough of the surrounding beliefs change, what was once a convergent point (say dignity as fundamental) could be **upended** without a clear boundary marking when “law” ceases to exist. Holism could imply that there’s no **sharp line between legal and non-legal beliefs** – they all form a continuum. This blurring troubles legal theorists who want a clear criterion for legality. If every belief (legal, moral, factual) is part of one big holistic system, then saying “law exists if beliefs converge” may be almost trivial – *which* beliefs, out of the whole network, count as law-giving? The risk is that convergence theory under holism either becomes **vague** (law exists when there is enough general cognitive overlap – but “enough” is hard to quantify), or it collapses into a form of **cultural coherence theory** where law is whatever fits best with the community’s overall worldview. That latter view might indeed make it hard to **criticize unjust laws** except by arguing the society’s whole belief system is wrong. Some might find that conclusion unappealing or relativistic.

* **Underdetermination and disagreement:** Holism also brings in the problem of **underdetermination**: different configurations of belief could equally explain the observed practices. Translated to law, perhaps several different convergences could underlie the same legal outcomes. For example, judges might converge on prohibiting torture – some out of a belief in dignity, others out of utilitarian calculus, others out of religious conviction. The legal rule (ban on torture) is stable, but the **epistemic convergence is only surface-deep**; underneath are divergent webs that just happen to intersect on this point. Holism would say each judge is integrating the anti-torture norm into their *own* coherent web. Thus the *appearance* of convergence may mask deeper **incoherence**. This is a vulnerability: if that surface agreement is pressured by a new scenario (say, a “ticking bomb” case challenging the absoluteness of the torture ban), those differing underlying beliefs might lead to a **breakdown in consensus**. A convergence theory built on the assumption of stable shared belief could be caught off guard by such fractures. It suggests convergence needs to be resilient across a range of connected beliefs, not just a single-point agreement.

In conclusion, **epistemological holism offers mixed lessons** for the convergence thesis. It reinforces the intuition that law’s recognition is not a narrow question of a lone rule, but part of a **whole fabric of interlocking beliefs** – supporting the idea that richer convergence (including normative elements) strengthens a legal system’s identity. However, holism also warns that if everything is interdependent, **demanding complete convergence is unrealistic** and perhaps unnecessary; partial agreements can do a lot of work. Moreover, it highlights a danger: a convergence theory must allow for **adaptability** and **scope for disagreement**, otherwise it portrays a frozen picture of what is actually a fluid web. The best takeaway is that a legal system might require a **critical mass of shared belief** to function (holism’s support), but it must also manage and compartmentalize disagreements within its epistemic network (holism’s caution).

## Conclusion: Reconstructing the Convergence-Based View of Law

Does the convergence of belief among legal actors, potentially around fundamental values like human dignity, provide a compelling foundation for the existence of law? Our survey suggests that there is *considerable merit* to this idea, but it must be articulated carefully to survive searching critiques. A **carefully reconstructed convergence-based theory** of law can indeed offer a **strong alternative to Hart’s purely social-factual model**, provided it incorporates the insights of its critics and avoids their pitfalls.

**Defensible core of the convergence thesis:** Law is **not a purely mechanistic set of commands**; it is a *social institution* that exists because people **think of it as existing** and treat it as such. At a minimum, legal officials must converge in **recognizing some common authority or rule** – Hart was right about that. But the convergence thesis illuminates that officials also often converge on a **sense of purpose and shared values** that give life to those dry rules. For example, the broad commitment to *the rule of law* and *basic rights* in many societies is more than a checklist – it’s a **mindset** that “this is how law ought to operate,” which in turn shapes **what counts as law**. By acknowledging this, the convergence view explains **why legal systems have a normative gravitational force** that mere habits cannot generate. It accounts for phenomena like the transnational invocation of human dignity – judges across different systems feeling bound by a **common value**, effectively *expanding* the convergent community beyond a single polity. This is a strength: it shows the law’s identity may include an **aspirational or ethical dimension** that people actually adhere to in practice, not just an external moral critique.

**Answering the critiques:** A reconstructed convergence theory would address critics in the following ways:

* **Authority (Raz’s concern):** The theory can concede to Raz that not *every* aspect of law should depend on moral reasoning – otherwise law loses its settlement function. Instead, it can distinguish between a **core convergence on fundamental values** and the **operational identification of day-to-day law**. For instance, officials might converge on *“constitutional principles of human dignity and equality”* as foundational, but they still use **source-based rules** (text of statutes, precedents) for ordinary legal questions. The convergence on values does not mean every legal question invokes moral debates; it simply ensures that the *framework* of identifying law is itself guided by a **widely shared sense of justice**. In practice, this looks like a constitution or basic norm that everyone accepts (a social fact) *because* they also believe in its underlying principles (moral content). Law’s authority is preserved because the **sources are still doing the immediate work** of identification, and only when those sources run out do judges openly appeal to the deeper convergent values (which they all largely accept). In short, convergence theory can be made **compatible with authority** by limiting the role of value-convergence to the **highest level of legal justification**, not every level. This way, it acknowledges Raz’s point that citizens shouldn’t have to solve morality anew for each law, while still claiming that a *background convergence* on, say, human dignity enhances the legitimacy of the whole system.

* **Disagreement (Waldron’s concern):** A refined convergence theory would explicitly incorporate the idea of **“incompletely theorized agreements.”** It need not claim that officials agree on *everything* – only that they share **enough** to regard themselves as part of a common enterprise. Waldron’s observations about persistent disagreement are well-taken: a legal system can tolerate a great deal of heterodoxy. Thus, the convergence thesis can be tempered to focus on a **thin but vital layer of agreement**: perhaps agreement on the **legitimacy of certain institutions and the minimal content of key rights**, even as debate continues about their precise scope. For example, virtually all U.S. officials accept the Constitution as binding (convergence on source) and broadly affirm ideals like “freedom” or “equality” as important – but they disagree on interpretation. The convergence theorist can say this is fine; what matters is that *nobody outright rejects those ideals or the project of working them out through law*. The **rule of recognition itself might be seen as partly unwritten**: “we, officials, will treat the outputs of these institutions as law *so long as* they aspire (even imperfectly) to honor the fundamental values we share.” In this way, dissent and debate are not only allowed but expected **within a convergent framework**. The convergence isn’t about specific outcomes, but about a **commitment to resolve disagreements within the parameters of shared fundamental commitments**. This answers Waldron by showing that convergence theory *recognizes the vitality of disagreement* and only demands unity where absolutely necessary for law’s continuity (e.g. no judge advocates abolishing the Constitution itself or repudiating the idea of individual rights altogether – if one did, we might say the legal system is in crisis).

* **Generality (Tamanaha’s concern):** To avoid parochialism, a convergence-based account should be phrased in a **culturally neutral way**. It would not insist on any one value (like dignity) for all legal systems, but rather say: *every* functioning legal system has **some set of fundamental beliefs that its officials converge on**, which furnish the system with stability and normative appeal. In a liberal democracy, that might be human dignity and equality; in a theocratic system, it might be the divine authority of holy scripture; in a customary system, it could be the wisdom of ancestral traditions. The theory thus becomes one about **structural convergence**: law’s existence is always underlain by a *shared epistemic frame*, though the content of that frame varies by society. This makes it a true general jurisprudence claim, incorporating Tamanaha’s insight that concepts must be useful for *understanding and evaluating* real legal phenomena. We can still critically evaluate those varying convergences (e.g., morally prefer one over another), but analytically we say **law exists** where such a convergence exists. This handles the cross-cultural diversity: it would count ancient or non-Western legal orders as having *law* so long as there was some convergent acceptance (even if on values we today disapprove of). Where convergence is completely lacking – say a society deeply split without any common ground, or a tyrant’s edicts obeyed only out of fear with no belief in their legitimacy – we might then say *to that extent, “law” in the fullest sense is compromised*. This resonates with the sense that terms like “rule of law” imply some minimal consensus on fairness and regularity; a regime of pure force might be called “law” in a thin sense, but arguably misses an *essential* aspect that convergence theory identifies.

* **Rational justification (Greenberg’s concern):** A robust convergence theory will strive to explain *why* convergent acceptance of certain fundamentals actually gives rise to **normative reasons**. Here the theory can partner with a dose of **epistemic (and moral) humility**: it can say that *because* officials (and citizens) converge on fundamental points, the law that grows out of those points carries a presumption of legitimacy **in that community’s own terms**. It may not be an *ultimate* moral justification, but it is a form of **second-order justification**: the fact of convergence itself has value because it represents a **collective deliberative settlement** of basic questions. In a Quinean spirit, one might argue that the **coherence of the web of belief** among lawmakers and enforcers *is what makes the system rational from within*. For an insider to reject a law recognized under these shared criteria would be irrational by their own lights, since it would contradict the very premises they accept along with everyone else. This provides an **internal reason** why law, once established by convergent criteria, ought to be followed (absent extraordinary moral overrides). To satisfy Greenberg fully, one might integrate that the convergent beliefs usually (hopefully) are not arbitrary but track **moral truths or useful social purposes** to some degree – which is often why they became focal points of convergence in the first place. In sum, the reconstructed theory explains that convergence of belief isn’t a magic wand but works in conjunction with moral reasoning: a convergence on a sound value yields a sound legal foundation; a convergence on a pernicious value (like racial supremacy) would give *law* of a kind, but one open to external moral condemnation. The theory thereby keeps an **aperture for moral critique** (not every convergence is praiseworthy), while maintaining that as a descriptive matter, convergence is what makes a system *legally functional* as law.

**Conclusion of the argument:** The convergence-based view, when refined along these lines, presents a **philosophically rich picture of legal existence**. It neither denies the importance of social facts nor the importance of moral values, but tries to show how the two interact in the real **epistemic life of legal systems**. It posits that law is most robust when it is **undergirded by a broad-based consensus** – not just a formal consensus on pedigree, but an **epistemic commitment to a shared legal framework and its guiding principles**. This can be seen as a middle path between stark positivism and abstract natural law: law’s authority comes from **our collective agreement to treat certain sources as authoritative**, and that agreement is deepest and most enduring when it is **informed by common values or beliefs** about justice.

In the style of Dworkin, one might say: **law is an interpretive concept, and the ultimate interpretation that makes sense of our legal practice is that we are striving, together, to instantiate certain fundamental principles**. In the style of Sunstein, one might add: **we don’t need to agree on the full theory of those principles, only on their broad contours and on the institutions that mediate our disagreements**. Thus reconstructed, the convergence-based theory does not demand a utopia of perfect unanimity, but it does suggest a **criterion for legal health**: the greater the *epistemic convergence* among those who operate the system, the clearer and more legitimate the law will be. Conversely, where fundamental convergence deteriorates, the identity of “law” itself grows tenuous – a point history bears out (e.g. in times of constitutional crises or civil war, when officials split into camps with incompatible beliefs, the legal system indeed breaks down).

Ultimately, whether one *defends* this view or not, exploring it has the virtue of highlighting that law is not only an external structure of rules but also an **internal realm of understanding**. The convergence of minds and the content of their beliefs are, as this literature suggests, part of law’s very existence. A nuanced convergence-based account, attentive to the critiques, may well provide a **stronger and more complete jurisprudential theory** – one that recognizes law as at once a social fact, a system of norms, and an expression of our collective practical reason.

**Sources:** This analysis has drawn upon contemporary legal-philosophical literature, including Hart’s classic positivist model, Raz’s arguments for source-based authority, Waldron’s critique of the rule of recognition, Tamanaha’s socio-legal insights, Greenberg’s moral impact theory and its criticism of purely social foundations, as well as discussions on human dignity in comparative jurisprudence and epistemological holism in knowledge systems. These sources illustrate the rich debate on whether a **consensus of belief is constitutive of law** and guide the careful reconstruction of the convergence thesis advanced here.

# Act Speech: Expressive Acts in Law and Normative Practice

## Introduction

Legal systems often hinge on more than written statutes and spoken words. They also depend on actions – votes, rulings, rituals, and patterns of obedience – that **express normative commitments** without a spoken utterance. Call this category **“Act Speech.”** This paper reconstructs and defends *Act Speech* as a distinct, analytically coherent class of normatively significant action. The aim is to show that Act Speech is a real phenomenon in legal and ethical life, one essential to explaining how laws gain recognition through convergent practices. By examining how certain **actions function expressively** or communicatively, we clarify how legal norms exist *not just by being stated, but by being acted out*. The analysis proceeds in the tradition of Anglo-American analytic legal philosophy – emphasizing conceptual precision and argument – while aiming for a Dworkinian narrative fluency. In doing so, we compare Act Speech by private citizens (e.g. public rituals or ordinary law-abiding conduct) with that of legal officials (e.g. legislative votes, judicial rulings). We also address objections, differentiating Act Speech from standard speech acts, and explore its implications for theories of legal existence and social acceptance. The conclusion will suggest that Act Speech is a necessary conceptual tool for jurisprudence: it helps explain how shared practices confer normative force on law, thus bridging the gap between mere convergent behavior and the *recognition* of legal norms.

## Defining Act Speech vs. Speech Acts

The concept of **Act Speech** builds on an analogy with J.L. Austin’s “speech acts,” but inverts it. In Austin’s classic framework, a *speech act* is an utterance that does something (e.g. promising by saying *“I promise”*). By contrast, **Act Speech** is doing something that *says* something – an **action that communicates or expresses a normative stance** without (or beyond) spoken words. In both cases, the performance is **normatively significant**, but Act Speech shifts the medium from language to conduct. Importantly, Act Speech is *not* a metaphor for all action; it refers to actions that have **conventional or recognized meaning** within a normative system, akin to how words have meaning in language.

To clarify this concept, consider a legislative assembly vote. When legislators raise their hands or press a “yea” button, they are not uttering a proposition; yet their **act of voting expresses approval or rejection** of a bill. The vote is counted as a decision – it *means* the law is enacted or not. Similarly, a judge who signs a ruling or issues a verdict is performing an official act that *communicates* the outcome and rationale of a case. These are paradigmatic instances of Act Speech: actions that are **understood to carry content or signal acceptance** of a norm. The action has a propositional or normative content (e.g. “This bill shall become law” or “The defendant is liable”) by virtue of legal convention.

It is vital to distinguish Act Speech from ordinary *behavior* that happens to be interpreted by others. Act Speech is **rule-governed and intentional**, like speech acts. As with language, there are shared conventions that “count” a given act as conveying a certain meaning. Philosopher John Searle described how **constitutive rules** underpin institutional acts: e.g. the rule *“X counts as Y in context C”*. Raising one’s hand during the vote *counts as* saying “I vote yes” in the legislative context. Likewise, **ritualized acts** (such as exchanging rings in a wedding, or swearing-in ceremonies) count as expressing commitment or authority. These constitutive conventions ensure that Act Speech is *intelligible*: participants know what is being “said” by the act, much as speakers know what words mean. In short, Act Speech is an **action type with conventional meaning in a normative practice**, thereby communicating a message or establishing a status (law passed, judgment rendered, promise made, etc.) in virtue of the action itself.

How is this different from a standard *speech act*? In a speech act, the medium of expression is linguistic; with Act Speech, the medium is non-linguistic conduct. A speech act (like an order or a promise) typically requires **utterance and uptake** in language. Act Speech, on the other hand, may involve *no utterance at all* (e.g. a silent handshake sealing a deal) or may include utterances that are secondary to the act (e.g. saying “I do” in a marriage ceremony, where the total act includes physical formalities). Furthermore, speech act theory traditionally struggles with **purely physical performances**. As Susan J. Brison observed, “all speech is conduct, involving an agent, and all conduct, being intentional, can be expressive”. Collier similarly sought to distinguish “speech (including expressive actions) from actions that do not (and cannot) count as speech”. Act Speech denotes those *intentional actions that do count as speech-like in their normative effect* – they are not mere brute behavior. For example, *symbolic acts* like burning a flag in protest are often treated as “speech” under First Amendment law because they intentionally convey a message. Act Speech generalizes this idea beyond constitutional free-speech context: it includes any act that *intentionally and conventionally expresses a normative position or brings about a normative outcome*.

To ensure analytical coherence, the category of Act Speech must have **criteria** distinguishing it from general action and from ordinary speech. We can outline key features:

* **Expressive Intent or Function:** The action is performed in part *to express, communicate, or symbolize* a thought, attitude, or norm. (E.g. a legislative yes-vote expresses support for a bill’s passage.)
* **Conventional Meaning:** There is a social or legal convention that attaches a specific normative meaning or outcome to that type of act (similar to words in a language). Without the convention, the act would be mere behavior (e.g. hand-raising means nothing legally unless a voting rule is in place).
* **Normative Impact:** By performing the act, the agent *changes or reinforces normative relations*. This could be creating a legal rule (by voting “yes”), asserting a right (by filing a lawsuit), acknowledging authority (by saluting a flag), etc. The act’s performance itself has a **content-full effect** in the normative system.
* **Audience or Uptake:** Like speech, Act Speech usually requires an audience or relevant observers who interpret the act. A judge’s ruling must be intelligible to parties and other officials; a citizen’s public ritual is meant to be seen by the community. The “uptake” confirms the act’s meaning (others treat the law as passed, the ruling as binding, the ritual as accomplished).

With these features, *Act Speech* is a robust concept: not every action qualifies, only those meeting these conditions. Thus, a private whim or an accidental behavior isn’t Act Speech, but a rule-governed intentional act (even if non-verbal) within a practice can be.

## Ordinary Acts vs. Official Acts as Act Speech

Act Speech manifests in both the **conduct of ordinary citizens** and the **official acts of legal authorities**, albeit in different ways. Understanding both is crucial, as it illuminates how normative order is upheld from two sides: the *bottom-up* acceptance by the public and the *top-down* declarations by authorities.

### Citizens’ Expressive Acts and Normative Conduct

In everyday life, people often engage in actions that have **expressive or symbolic significance** in an ethical or legal context. Consider a simple example: **law-abiding conduct**. When a citizen carefully follows the law *even when not forced*, their conduct can be seen as *expressing respect for the rule of law*. Hart famously noted that in any functioning legal system, the bulk of the population *accepts* and obeys primary rules “without further direction”. This acceptance is usually manifested in behavior – people stop at red lights, pay taxes, refrain from theft, etc., not only due to fear of sanctions but often because they **internalize the norm**. From an external point of view, widespread compliance is a mere pattern of behavior; but from the internal point of view of participants, each act of obedience can signify an **endorsement of the legal rule**. Kelsen put this insight sharply: a legal norm’s validity depends in part on its *efficacy*, meaning it is generally followed by society. Citizens collectively “speak” through action by *taking the law as a guide*. When their conduct converges in obedience, it performs the social affirmation that “this is our law.” In Kelsen’s terms, the **Basic Norm** (Grundnorm) – the presupposed master norm of a legal system – is only in force if it is *by and large effective*, i.e. people actually act in accordance with it. Thus, the **social acceptance of legal norms is enacted through myriad small acts of compliance**. Each such act can be viewed as Act Speech: citizens through their conscientious behavior are *communicating support* for the normative order (even if implicitly). Indeed, one scholar notes that *the Basic Norm is presupposed when a citizen chooses to read the actions of legal officials in a normative way*, essentially *interpreting* those actions as lawful and obeying accordingly. The citizens’ perspective turns their own obedience into a statement of recognition: *our officials’ acts count as law, and we shall treat them as such*.

Beyond routine compliance, **public rituals and demonstrations** by citizens also exemplify Act Speech. Rituals – whether civic (like national anthem ceremonies) or religious (which may have legal significance in some systems) – carry communicative intent. A oath-taking ceremony is not just speaking words; it’s the whole performance (standing, hand on heart or scripture, reciting formulae) that conveys commitment. Philosophers of language and anthropology have observed that rituals “share with speech acts this quality of accomplishing something simply by their performance”. The marriage ceremony is a clear case: by the ritual act (exchange of rings, “I do,” signing a register), two people *become* legally married. But notice, the ring exchange itself – a physical act – is a **material carrier of meaning** about commitment. Similarly, a *public protest* can have elements of Act Speech. When demonstrators link arms at a courthouse or take a knee during a national anthem, their **conduct sends a message** – often more powerfully than words could. These actions are usually intentional and symbolic, meant to convey approval, dissent, or solidarity. Under U.S. constitutional law, such expressive conduct is treated as “symbolic speech” precisely because it is conduct that communicates. The normative significance here is ethical and political: the actions assert rights or values (justice, equality, patriotism, etc.) without or beyond verbal discourse. They can even shape social norms; for example, **civil disobedience acts** (like Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat) became powerful norm-changing statements through action.

Another subtle form of Act Speech by ordinary people is **customary practice**. In some legal systems, consistent public practices can harden into customary law. The community’s *repeated acts* (fishing in certain waters, honoring certain agreements) effectively “speak” a norm into existence over time. These acts communicate mutual expectations and acceptance of a rule (“this is how things are to be done”), which legal authorities might later recognize as binding custom. Here the entire community’s behavior has a propositional content: e.g. *“we regard this type of contract as binding by custom.”*

In all these cases, the **actions of citizens are doing normative *talking***. They **express attitudes** (of respect, protest, commitment) and often aim to **invoke or reinforce norms** (obeying the law to bolster its authority, performing rituals to affirm values, protesting to demand change). This bottom-up Act Speech contributes to what Ronald Dworkin might call the *“social narrative”* of law – the lived values and understandings that law must answer to. It also plays a role in law’s existence: without a degree of congruence between law on the books and law in action (the populace’s practices), legal norms risk becoming moot. Hart acknowledged as much: if officials alone follow the rule of recognition but no citizen obeys primary rules, the system’s efficacy (and arguably its existence) is in doubt. Citizens’ Act Speech thus helps *maintain* the law’s normativity from the ground up.

### Officials’ Acts as Communicative Performances

If citizens’ actions provide the foundation of acceptance, the **acts of legal officials are the formal articulations of the legal system**. Officials don’t just speak through statutes and judgments; their **very acts of law-creation and law-application are instances of Act Speech par excellence**. Consider a few exemplars:

* **Legislative Voting and Enactment:** When a legislature enacts a statute, it typically does so via formal voting procedures and ceremonial steps (readings, signing by an executive, etc.). Each *“aye” vote* is an act signaling the legislator’s consent to the law’s content, while the collective act (a majority passing the bill, the speaker declaring “the bill is passed”) is itself **performative** – it *brings about* a new legal rule. In Austin’s terms, this resembles an *illocutionary act* (a declaration that changes legal reality). But unlike typical speech acts which are verbal, here the crucial components may be non-verbal (raising hands, electronic votes, the formality of a signature). The **meaning** of these acts is fixed by constitutional and parliamentary rules. As the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy explains, a group of people raising their hands and counting yeas “are not the law” by themselves; it is the **interpretation of these actions by legal norms** that makes them an enactment of a new law. In Kelsenian terms, a “higher” norm (e.g. the constitution) confers legal-normative meaning on the otherwise ordinary acts of voting and signing. Thus the legislators’ acts *speak in the language of law*: they declare what shall be obligatory or forbidden. Notably, these legislative Act Speeches often have **expressive ramifications** beyond their direct legal effect: A legislature’s act of voting to recognize same-sex marriage, for instance, is *understood as a statement of equality and acceptance* in society (the law “says” that these unions deserve recognition). Conversely, withholding legal recognition has expressive significance – it *sends a message* of exclusion. The *content* of the law is thus accompanied by a *communicative content* in the very fact of its enactment or non-enactment.

* **Judicial Decisions and Precedents:** A judge’s ruling is often verbal (a written judgment or an oral announcement), but it is also irreducibly an **act of authority**. As one scholar defines it, *“a judicial decision \[is] an act by a judge adjudicating a case according to law, with authority conferred on him”*. The judge performs an institutional speech act: saying “I find for the plaintiff” doesn’t just convey information – it *changes the legal positions* of the parties. In speech-act classification, many judicial utterances are *declarations* (in Searle’s sense) that make something true by saying it under appropriate conditions (e.g. “This contract is void” said by a judge in court thereby makes it void). But beyond the utterance, consider the **ritual and conduct**: the judge taking the bench, hearing arguments, and signing the judgment order. These actions, viewed in context, carry the weight of the court’s authority and commitment to the rule of law. Cass Sunstein notes that the public pays *close attention to Supreme Court pronouncements* partly because of their *“expressive or symbolic character”* – the Court is “often taken to be speaking on behalf of the nation’s basic principles and commitments”. In other words, when a supreme court justice **acts** by rendering a decision, the populace interprets that *act* (not just the words in the opinion) as a reflection of core values or a stance of the legal system. This expressive dimension is evident in landmark cases: e.g., the act of **overruling** *Brown v. Board of Education* would have communicated a drastic retreat from equality, while the act of **upholding** rights can signal societal principles. Judges themselves recognize this – dissenting and concurring opinions often frame what the *court’s action says or fails to say*. Thus, the **court’s decision as an act** has a *meaning in the social realm*, contributing to law’s moral or political narrative. Furthermore, when courts follow precedent or distinguish it, their acts of adherence or deviation *express* an attitude toward past decisions (respect, or the view that a change is needed). This is a kind of *dialogue through action across time* in the judiciary.

* **Administrative and Executive Acts:** Officials also “speak” norms into reality through non-judicial acts: issuing regulations, signing treaties, performing official ceremonies (like inaugurations or pardons). A presidential pardon, for instance, is largely an *act (the signing of a document, the formal proclamation)* that has an embedded meaning of forgiveness/clemency and changes the legal status of an individual. It is understood as **communicating mercy or rectifying injustice**, beyond the legal effect of erasing a sentence. In international law, the formal act of **recognizing a new state** (often by exchanging diplomatic notes or a declaration) is an act that *confers status* and also *signals a message* about legitimacy to the world community.

* **Recognitional Acts in Rule of Recognition:** At a more abstract level, Hart’s *rule of recognition* posits that legal officials converge on certain criteria for identifying law. But how do we know officials converge? Through their **acts of recognition**. When a judge treats a constitution as binding, or a clerk files a statute as law, these routine acts *recognize certain norms as valid*. Marcin Matczak suggests re-interpreting Hart’s rule of recognition in terms of Austinian speech acts – treating “recognition, change, and adjudication” as acts, not just rules. On this view, the *“act of recognition”* by officials (their behaviors of using certain sources as authoritative) can itself be seen as a **speech act declaring what counts as law**. Indeed, a rule of recognition exists only *if* officials’ conduct converges accordingly. If no common conduct, then no shared rule. So each time officials apply the same norm-criteria, they perform Act Speech that collectively says: *“This is our law.”* Notably, their **agreement need not be verbal**; it can be an implicit understanding manifested in consistent acts of enforcement and reference. Hart emphasized the “internal point of view” – officials’ acceptance of the rule – which is evidenced by their critical reactions and practice. The *practice* is key: it is through acts (criticizing a colleague who strays from the accepted sources, etc.) that the acceptance is shown. Thus, official acts carry **constitutive power**: they are not only enforcing the law but continually *constituting* the law’s identity by expressing what the rule of recognition endorses. This performative aspect of official practices buttresses convergence-based theories: it explains how mere regularities of behavior can amount to a rule (because the behaviors are *normatively loaded actions*, not accidental coincidences).

In all these official contexts, **Act Speech is at its most formalized**. Legal systems surround these acts with ceremony and procedure, underscoring their performative weight. The ritual of signing a bill into law, the appellate court’s procession and reading of a verdict, even the wearing of robes or the elevation on a bench – these serve to mark the actions as *authoritative speech* by the body politic. The **expressive function of law** is often most visible here: *law “speaks” through the actions of its makers and appliers.* As Sunstein argues, *“the function of law \[is] in ‘making statements’ as opposed to controlling behavior directly”*. Many laws and official acts aim to **express values and shift norms**, not just coerce. For example, anti-discrimination laws “speak” by enacting a social commitment to equality, even before enforcement kicks in. Sunstein notes that people support laws often because of *“the statements made by law”* – even debates (like over flag-burning amendments) focus on the law’s *expressive content*. Crucially, *not only laws “speak,” but the act of lawmaking itself speaks*. A Supreme Court decision, as Sunstein observes, is attended by an expressive aura: *what it says about national principles may matter as much as its practical consequences*. He calls this broader perspective **“norm management”** – using law’s expressive capacity to guide societal norms. Thus, officials engaging in Act Speech are consciously or unconsciously **managing the social meaning** of actions. Their deeds set examples, send signals, and in effect *speak to citizens* about what is important or unimportant, permitted or prohibited, valued or disfavored.

## Act Speech and Convergent Recognition of Law

A central claim of this paper is that recognizing Act Speech as a category helps explain **convergence-based theories of legal recognition** – chiefly, Hart’s idea of the rule of recognition as a social rule arising from convergent practice. One might ask: if the rule of recognition is *just* a practice, how can it be normative? How do mere converging behaviors amount to an *acknowledged rule* that criteria X, Y, Z confer legality? The answer lies in the **expressive, communicative aspect of those behaviors**.

Hart described the rule of recognition as **“a convergent practice of officials”** combined with a *critical reflective attitude* (the internal point of view). This convergence is not a mysterious natural force but the result of each official *intentionally following a practice and expecting others to do the same*. Each judge’s or official’s *act of following the accepted criteria* has a dual character: it is both a physical event (applying a source of law) and a **meaningful signal** to others about what counts as law. As one commentator put it, the rule of recognition depends on *“official consensus”*, i.e. the agreement implicit in shared practice. That consensus is **formed and communicated by the pattern of acts** each official performs. When judges across a jurisdiction uniformly treat a written constitution as supreme law, every act of doing so (citing the constitution, invalidating conflicting statutes, swearing an oath to uphold it) is effectively a **speech act of acceptance**. Over time, these acts create a **shared understanding** – an *intersubjective truth* – that “our law is whatever the Constitution (and things deriving authority under it) says.” The practice becomes self-confirming: officials look to what other officials do and see their own attitude reflected, which reinforces their commitment. In short, **the rule of recognition is upheld by Act Speech feedback loops** among officials.

This view addresses a classical criticism raised by Dworkin. Dworkin argued that Hartian positivism cannot account for *“theoretical disagreements”* – cases where judges disagree about the criteria of law (for example, whether morality can be a criterion) even though they appear to be in the same legal system. He thought Hart’s model reduced their disagreement either to confusion or to talking past each other, because if a rule of recognition is just actual convergence, any real dissent means no shared rule exists. However, if we frame officials’ behavior in terms of Act Speech, we can allow that judges participate in a *practice* even as they debate its reach. The core of convergence might be narrower than the dispute. For instance, judges may all accept “constitution + statutes + precedent” as baseline criteria (and they act accordingly), but debate whether “justice” or “democratic principles” should also inform validity. Their **actions converge enough** (all still apply the constitution, etc.), so they continue to engage in the same *language-game* of legal validity, even as they argue over adding a new word or nuance (the role of moral principles). In effect, the *actions themselves provide a common platform of communication*. Each judge’s rulings *speak to the others*: either reinforcing the traditional criteria or suggesting a departure. A minority judge might, by her actions, try to *introduce* a new practice (e.g. citing moral principles as binding) – an unsuccessful Act Speech if colleagues reject it, or the seed of a change if they eventually converge. By seeing these moves as communicative acts, we avoid dismissing them as not legal disagreements. They are indeed disagreements *within* the practice, couched in action and reaction. **Act Speech theory thus shores up the positivist account** by showing how a social practice can be normative and contestable: the practice is maintained by continuous expressive action, which can also modify the practice as participants respond to each other. Legal officials are then like interlocutors in a conversation, mostly agreeing on grammar and vocabulary (the rule of recognition’s core) but occasionally proposing new usages or rejecting dubious ones. The conversation doesn’t cease to exist because of an argument; similarly, the rule of recognition endures through certain disagreements so long as an overriding convergence in action persists. In Kevin Toh’s expressivist interpretation of Hart, *internal legal statements* (statements from the internal point of view, e.g. “This is a valid law”) are not plain descriptions but have a normative stance woven in. Act Speech provides the behavioral counterpart: *internal legal acts* (like applying a rule) likewise carry a stance. For Hart (as read by Toh), the judge who says “This is the law” is at once describing and expressing acceptance. The judge who **acts** on a norm does the same, without needing to say it explicitly each time – her actions speak for her. This expressivist element was Hart’s answer to Dworkin: even when judges disagree on *what the law requires in theory*, they agree in practical attitude (each is still trying to *do* what the law requires, as they see it). The disagreements are about *interpretation within a shared practice*, not about throwing out the practice entirely. Therefore, recognizing the communicative role of acts enriches the rule of recognition model: it’s not a dumb convergence of habit, but a **normative discourse carried out in deeds**.

Furthermore, Act Speech sheds light on the **social acceptance** condition of legal validity in a way that reconciles Hart and Kelsen. Hart focused on officials’ convergence; Kelsen on general efficacy (including citizens). If we take Act Speech seriously, we see that *both officials and citizens engage in continuous acts that affirm the legal system*. Officials *declare and apply* the law (top-down Act Speech); citizens *comply and invoke* the law (bottom-up Act Speech). The “existence” of a legal system is then partly a matter of **performative uptake**: The officials’ acts only successfully create law if broadly accepted and followed; the citizens’ acts of compliance only make sense if there are official acts to respond to. There is a **coordination of expressive conduct**. This resonates with H.L.A. Hart’s famous statement that if no general obedience, “nothing that we now recognize as law could exist”. It also echoes Kelsen’s point that the basic norm’s content is determined by actual practices (which change, say, after a revolution). Law persists as an institution because people continue to *act it out*. And they act it out in roles – as law-makers, law-appliers, law-followers – that involve **acting as if the law is binding** (for officials) and **acting as if the law is to be obeyed** (for citizens). These are self-validating performances when they converge. In philosophical terms, this is a kind of **constructivist, practice-based normativity**: the norm exists because it is enacted in a certain way by a community, and this enactment (the concerted Act Speech) is constitutive of the norm’s validity or existence.

Finally, Act Speech helps explain why **social acceptance has a normative dimension, not purely factual**. If we only count heads (90% obey this law), we have an “is.” But if we interpret their obedience as meaningful endorsement, we inch toward an “ought.” Act Speech is the bridge: it imbues the raw social facts with meaning. In jurisprudence, this addresses the worry of deriving *ought* from *is*. The answer is that we’re not directly deriving – rather, the *“is” (people act in X way)* comes already wrapped in a normative attitude (their acts express acceptance of an “ought” that they believe). The basic norm can then be seen not as a whimsical presupposition, but as a concise description of that attitude: “One ought to obey the historically first constitution” (for example) is just making explicit what officials *implicitly say through their conduct*. When that conduct ceases (say officials cease to enforce old constitution and start following a new revolutionary rule), the implicit statement changes, and jurists say the basic norm has shifted.

## Coherence, Objections, and Refinements

Is *Act Speech* truly a coherent, distinct category? We must consider potential objections:

**1. Isn’t all action potentially expressive?** One might argue that any intentional action can convey something about the actor’s beliefs or intentions, so what’s special about “Act Speech”? Indeed, human actions are often laden with meaning – but **Act Speech denotes a narrower class** of actions that have *conventional normative content*. Not every intentional act qualifies. If I tie my shoelaces or pour a cup of coffee, I might inadvertently reveal I’m going for a run or that I like caffeine, but these acts are not governed by social conventions to communicate normative positions. In contrast, a judge’s gavel strike, a soldier’s salute, or a voter’s ballot are all actions we have *rules for interpreting*. The coherence of Act Speech lies in **its rule-bound nature**. We recognize certain actions *within practices* as analogous to statements. This aligns with what John Searle noted: some actions are *constituted* by rules (like moves in a game or rituals in a ceremony), not just regulated by them. Act Speech covers only those constituted, communicative acts. So while it’s true that “all conduct… can be expressive” in a broad sense, Act Speech is the subset that forms part of a **system of normative communication** (law, morality, custom, ritual). It’s no more trivial than saying “any sound can be expressive.” True, but not any sound is *linguistic* – only those in a language system. Similarly, Act Speech picks out the **“linguistic” actions of the social world**, the ones with grammar and vocabulary given by norms and conventions.

**2. Is Act Speech just metaphorical language?** Perhaps “speech” is a misleading metaphor, and these are just *acts*, full stop. Why insist on labeling them as a kind of speech? The reason is analytical payoff: doing so highlights their **expressive dimension** and invites use of tools from **philosophy of language** to analyze them. By calling something speech, we examine it for things like meaning, truth-value (or satisfaction conditions), illocutionary force, and uptake. We have seen that legislative and judicial acts have **illocutionary force** (they enact, command, declare). They require **uptake** by others (a law is only effective if recognized by officials and citizens; a judicial ruling only works if obeyed or at least understood and recorded). They also can be evaluated in normative *felicity* terms: just as a speech act can misfire (uttering “I baptize you” without authority does nothing), an act of law-making can misfire if done without jurisdiction or proper form – it’s a *nullity*, “not really saying anything” legally. These parallels are tight. Moreover, framing official acts as speech acts can elucidate *content*: A law can be seen as having a propositional content (a set of norms) and an illocutionary force (e.g., commanding). The *act of legislating* asserts that content with authority. If we drop the speech analogy, we might overlook such structure and just see a black-box “outcome.” Philosophers like Luís Duarte d’Almeida have studied **normative language** and legal statements, probing how saying *“X is legally valid”* intertwines description and endorsement. Act Speech extends that inquiry: how does doing *“X (according to legal form)”* convey endorsement of X’s normativity? This is more than metaphor – it is treating like cases alike. We use “speech-act theory” rigorously to understand non-traditional speech acts (e.g. gestures, rituals). The benefit is a deeper grasp of how normativity is communicated and established. That said, we must be careful not to overextend the metaphor. Not all aspects of linguistic speech acts have an analogue in conduct. For example, **lying** is a speech concept; can one “lie” by action? Possibly – think of a sham ceremony intended to deceive. But generally, *Act Speech is limited to contexts where actions are already expected to have meaning.* In those contexts, speaking of “truth” or “sincerity” of the act can make sense (a genuine vs. sham compliance, a sincere vs. insincere oath). So while metaphorical language lurks, the category can be fleshed out in non-metaphorical terms of conventions and intentions as we have done.

**3. Is Act Speech really new? Isn’t this just the well-known *expressive function of law* or *symbolic speech*?** It’s true that many elements of Act Speech are discussed in legal theory under other labels. Cass Sunstein’s **expressive function of law** highlights that law and governmental actions *“express values”* and thereby influence social norms. First Amendment law speaks of **expressive conduct** as “symbolic speech”. These correspond closely to our idea: they all recognize that **actions by state or citizen can send a message**. However, Act Speech as a concept aims to be a **general jurisprudential category** tying together these strands and giving them a unified theoretical explanation. Expressive law theory often focuses on *policy implications* – e.g., how laws can be crafted to signal norms or why people obey law because of its signal. Symbolic speech doctrine is confined to a constitutional free speech analysis. Act Speech, by contrast, is a concept at the intersection of **philosophy of law and philosophy of language**: it suggests that some **actions constitute a type of speech act** intrinsic to how law works as a normative order. It thus can ground expressive law theories in a more systematic account of action and meaning. Moreover, Act Speech encompasses not only *intentional norm-shifting expression* (Sunstein’s focus) but also the *background practice* that makes norms exist (Hart’s focus). It explains not just how law *influences* norms, but how law *is* a norm (through practice). In doing so it clarifies why, for instance, **recognitional practices** are meaningful and why **social acceptance** confers validity, without resorting purely to psychology or coercion. In short, Act Speech theory isn’t brand-new magic; it’s a consolidation and clarification of ideas already percolating, from Austin’s performatives to ritual studies to legal expressivism. The novelty lies in explicitly carving out this category and arguing for its indispensability in jurisprudence.

**4. Doesn’t emphasizing Act Speech risk collapsing the distinction between *talking about norms* and *acting under norms*?** Traditional positivists might caution: describing a judge’s behavior is one thing, saying it *means* something normative is another – we shouldn’t confuse internal and external perspectives. Hart indeed separated the internal viewpoint (seeing an act as obeying a rule) from the external (observer’s descriptive account). The worry might be that Act Speech blurs this, by attributing communicative meaning to the act itself observable externally. However, the distinction remains. **Act Speech does not deny the difference between an observer who sees just movements and a participant who sees norms**. Rather, it explains how the gap is bridged. The internal participant (the official or citizen) *intends* the act as normatively guided; the external observer, if a social scientist, can note that intention and the practice that underpins it. When we, as theorists, talk of Act Speech, we adopt a kind of *hermeneutic stance*: we interpret the act in light of the shared meanings in that society. This is similar to how an anthropologist might interpret a ritual of another culture as signifying a myth or value. We are not collapsing “is” and “ought”; we are highlighting how in human practices, the “is” (the action) can *encode an ought*. If anything, Act Speech underscores Hart’s point: one cannot fully describe certain social facts (like a judge banging a gavel) without reference to the underlying norm (“court is now in session”). The gavel sound is a physical event; its meaning (“session started”) is part of the practice. Our theory respects that by situating meaning in convention and intent, not in the bare physical movements. So, while a strict external view might withhold any normative terms, that view is insufficient to explain the practice’s functioning. Act Speech invites a **soft internal perspective in analysis**: we report the fact *and* its social meaning.

**5. Could Act Speech lead to overextension – seeing communication where none exists?** One must be careful not to read *every* official action as deliberate expression. For example, some convergent behaviors might be motivated by inertia or fear rather than communicative intent. A junior bureaucrat might follow a rule not to “say” anything but just to avoid sanction. Do we still call that Act Speech? The reply is that Act Speech, like ordinary speech, can occur even if not all participants are self-aware of expressing something. In language, people convey meanings with words even if they just parrot them to avoid trouble. The language system doesn’t cease to be meaningful because one speaker lacks expressive intent; it only requires that, in general, the practice is geared toward meaningful communication. Similarly, a legal practice can count as Act Speech if *overall* it is understood as normative and reasons-based, even if some instances are rote. The bureaucrat’s act is given meaning by the institution (it counts as enforcing a rule), though the bureaucrat personally may not ponder it. It’s analogous to how an utterance still has meaning from language conventions even if the speaker says it unthinkingly. However, if a whole system’s officials truly had zero communicative intent or understanding, we might indeed question whether it’s a norm-following practice at all (imagine a “zombie” bureaucracy that mindlessly does things without any notion of rules – that borders on an unintelligible scenario for law). Real legal systems rely on at least the key players (judges, legislators) treating their actions as meaningful. Others can fall in line imitatively without undoing the practice’s normativity.

In summary, while objections help refine the concept (we must guard its boundaries and not anthropomorphize actions), **Act Speech proves coherent and defensible**. It robustly distinguishes a class of actions that *function like speech* in normative domains. It complements speech act theory by extending it beyond language, and complements legal theory by providing a framework to discuss how **“actions speak louder than words” in law** – sometimes literally making the law.

## Implications for Legal and Moral Theory

Embracing Act Speech as a concept yields several fruitful implications:

* **Jurisprudential Analysis:** We gain a vocabulary for discussing how law is a *practice of doing*, not just a *system of saying*. This helps integrate analytic jurisprudence with sociological and linguistic insights. For instance, it provides a way to talk about the *signaling effect of judicial decisions* in a rigorous manner, or the *commitment expressed by enacting a law*. Rather than siloing the “operative” aspect of an act from its “expressive” aspect, we analyze them together. This could enrich debates on topics like the **rule of recognition, obedience, and normativity**. It resonates with inclusive positivist views that moral principles can become binding if accepted in practice – one could track whether judges’ **acts increasingly incorporate moral evaluation** as a sign of a new criterion being adopted. It also might inform understanding of Hart’s `internal point of view` by emphasizing that *taking that view involves acting in certain ways, not just believing propositions*. In effect, Act Speech bridges **philosophy of law** and **philosophy of action**, encouraging an interdisciplinary method.

* **Metaethics and Normative Language:** In metaethics, *expressivist* theories claim that moral statements express attitudes rather than report facts. A parallel can be drawn: perhaps *legal statements* (like “X is law”) express acceptance of norms. Act Speech adds that *legal actions* similarly express acceptance or attitudes. This might be seen as a form of **pragmatism about norms** – meaning is in the doing. It aligns with views (like those of American Legal Realists or pragmatists) that focus on what officials *do* as the real content of law. But here we’ve given it a normative twist: it’s not cynical “law is what officials do, period,” but “law is what officials (and people) *communicatively* do.” This might offer a middle path between hard positivist and interpretivist theories, by granting that something normatively charged is happening in behavior itself. It also dovetails with theories of **quasi-expressivism** in jurisprudence (e.g. Finlay and Plunkett’s work modeling legal statements as expressing certain attitudes while still being truth-apt). Our account suggests legal *actions* could likewise be understood as having content that can be evaluated (perhaps not truth, but correctness under standards).

* **Legal Interpretation and Dialogue:** Seeing precedent and legislation as a kind of dialogue of actions can affect how we think of interpretation. Dworkin championed a view of law as *integrity*, requiring interpreters to see the law as a coherent narrative. Act Speech underscores that *the narrative is not just in texts but in deeds*. An interpreter might consider, say, the practices of enforcement or the traditions of ceremony as part of what gives a legal rule its meaning or weight. It also suggests that **silences or omissions in action** can speak: e.g., if over decades no prosecutor ever brings charges under an old statute, that lack of action speaks to a possible norm of desuetude (the law’s effective dormancy). This could contribute to doctrines of desuetude or implied repeal via non-use, giving them a firmer conceptual foundation in communicative action (the community, by not acting, *expresses* that the norm is no longer binding).

* **Democratic Theory:** Act Speech highlights the role of citizens’ actions in giving life to law. This has democratic significance. It’s not only through elections or petitions that people “speak” in a democracy; it’s through ongoing compliance, civil society rituals, and occasional protest. Their normative actions provide feedback to lawmakers. For example, massive civil disobedience against a law conveys that the law lacks social acceptance (as with prohibition in the 1920s U.S.); conversely, voluntary over-compliance or enthusiastic participation (people lining up to vote beyond expectation) conveys legitimacy. This perspective might encourage theorists to see **democratic deliberation as partly enacted** rather than solely spoken or written. Policies could be evaluated not only on outcomes but on what behavior they *expressly call forth* from the public (does a policy invite cooperation or resistance? Does it ask citizens to perform virtues or vices?).

* **Law and Morality Connection:** Lastly, Act Speech could inform the perennial debate on law’s relationship with morality. Natural law theorists argue that an unjust law is not truly law (no moral obligation to obey); positivists maintain a separation. Act Speech doesn’t solve that, but it reframes the discussion: the moral force of law might depend on what law *expresses* through actions. If a legal system’s operations express commitment to justice (through fair trials, respectful enforcement), this might generate moral allegiance. If its operations express oppression or arbitrariness (through show trials, secret police), that Act Speech could undermine its moral claim. This approach resonates with Lon Fuller’s idea that *fidelity to law* is maintained by observing certain procedural virtues (which are actions – like giving notice, holding open hearings). It also complements recent work on the *claim of law*: some argue law implicitly claims moral authority. Well, that claim is manifested in actions such as the judge intoning sentence *in the name of the people*. Thus, analyzing those acts might clarify whether law’s claim is deserved or merely pretentious.

## Conclusion

We have argued that *Act Speech* is a real and indispensable category for understanding normativity in law. Through analysis of examples – from a legislature’s vote to a citizen’s ritual compliance – we showed that **certain actions function as communicative, meaning-bearing elements of legal practice**. These acts are not mere accompaniment to speech; they often *are* the locus of normative force (a law is made by voting, not by the lawmakers describing the vote). Act Speech, as defined, is coherent: it captures the class of intentional, convention-laden acts that convey normative content or perform normative functions. It stands distinct from ordinary speech acts (since it need not be verbal) yet parallels them in structure and effect.

The utility of this concept was demonstrated in explaining **convergence-based legal theory**. Hart’s rule of recognition becomes more lucid when we see officials’ convergent behavior as an ongoing conversation in deeds about what counts as law. The supposed gap between social facts and normative validity is narrowed by recognizing that the social facts themselves (the convergent acts) carry normative meaning and endorsement. In other words, Act Speech is the mechanism by which *“Is” gets a dose of “Ought.”* This provides a defense of conventionalist legal positivism against critiques like Dworkin’s: it isn’t oblivious to genuine disagreement or moral dimension, since the practice is suffused with expressive acts, not bare habits.

Furthermore, we engaged with criticisms to refine Act Speech. The concept avoids triviality by focusing on convention and intention; it is not redundant with other terms but indeed synthesizes them under a unified analytic lens. By treating some actions as analogous to language, we gain insight without mysticism: we can apply speech-act theory, expressivist semantics, and other tools to these phenomena. This yields a richer jurisprudence that accounts for the **performative reality of law** – law as something we *do* together, not just a set of propositions.

In narrative terms, one might say law is a grand dialogue, and not all of it is spoken. Part of it is acted out in legislative halls, on courthouse steps, and in daily life when an individual abides by or challenges a rule. These actions speak – sometimes softly, sometimes loudly – and legal philosophy should listen. *Act Speech* as a concept asks legal philosophers to be attentive to the **language of action** in our normative practices. By incorporating that language into our theories, we better explain how law secures its place in our social world: how it is *recognized, upheld, and sometimes changed, through the things we do*. Thus, Act Speech describes an existing category of action – one that any convincing theory of law’s existence and authority must acknowledge. It reminds us that to fully understand *lex*, one must also understand *actus*. Law’s empire, to borrow Dworkin’s image, is built not only of words but of deeds that speak. And when those deeds align in the right way, *we have law*.

In conclusion, defending Act Speech enriches analytic legal philosophy by highlighting the expressive, convergence-driven dimension of legal normativity. It validates the intuition that **actions, no less than words, can be part of the fabric of law**, carrying normative significance and shaping the legal landscape. Recognizing this category helps us navigate complex issues of recognition, authority, and legitimacy with greater nuance. As a result, jurisprudence gains a conceptual tool that is both descriptive of our legal practices and normative in its explanatory power. The hope is that future scholarship can build on this foundation – analyzing particular legal phenomena (from constitutional ceremonies to jury verdicts) through the lens of Act Speech – thereby advancing our understanding of how **law lives through action and how our actions can speak law into existence**.

## Distinctions from Discourse Theory and Conversational Theory

Your suspicion is insightful. Indeed, there are important overlaps between the developed notion of **Act Speech** and established positions known as **discourse theory** (Habermas, Alexy, Günther) or **conversational theory** (Grice, Brandom). However, there are also distinctive points of divergence, especially relevant for jurisprudence.

### **Areas of Convergence**

Both discourse theory and conversational theory emphasize the communicative dimension of practices—whether linguistic or non-linguistic—as essential to establishing and sustaining normative order. They acknowledge that:

* Normativity emerges from shared practices.
* These practices involve communication or expressive actions that imply mutual recognition.
* Social acceptance and convergence around norms require ongoing interpretive participation.

In short, the key claim—that acts can carry propositional or normative meaning similar to speech—is indeed found in discourse and conversational theories.

### **Areas of Divergence and Originality**

Nevertheless, **Act Speech** as presented above differs crucially in several aspects:

#### 1. **Medium of Expression**

* Traditional conversational or discourse theories (Habermas, Grice, Brandom) focus overwhelmingly on explicit linguistic communication. Habermas, for instance, explicitly states that normative validity emerges primarily from discursive justification (*Between Facts and Norms*, 1996). Robert Brandom similarly locates normative inferential commitments explicitly in linguistic discourse (*Making It Explicit*, 1994).

* **Act Speech**, by contrast, specifically argues that non-verbal actions—legislative voting, judicial rituals, compliance behaviors, rituals—can **constitute or express normative content directly**. It broadens the analysis of communication beyond linguistic discourse. This is philosophically significant because it extends the boundaries of normative expression to non-linguistic practices within law and morality, which traditional discourse theory either downplays or addresses only indirectly.

#### 2. **Constitutive vs. Interpretive**

* Conversational theories (Grice’s conversational implicature, Habermasian discourse) emphasize mutual interpretation as generating normative understanding. Normativity is, broadly speaking, constructed through intersubjective interpretation or justification.

* **Act Speech** posits something stronger: certain actions within legal and ethical practice are constitutive rather than merely interpretive. In other words, the meaning of actions like legislative votes or judicial rulings is not just inferred afterward; rather, these acts constitute normative changes directly by virtue of their conventional role. The legislative act *is itself the law*, not merely an object of interpretive discourse. While Habermas allows for a constitutive function within formal procedures, Act Speech generalizes this feature explicitly and robustly into all acts that satisfy certain criteria.

#### 3. **Institutional Context and Conventions**

* Discourse theory generally treats validity as emerging from ideal discourse conditions, or at least from consensus-oriented discussions (Habermas’s "ideal speech situation," Brandom’s inferential commitments). These theories primarily rely on discursive justification or the rational acceptability of claims.

* By contrast, **Act Speech** emphasizes the concrete role of **institutional conventions and rules** that determine the meaning and normative force of actions. It relies explicitly on the analytical jurisprudential tradition (Hart, Kelsen, Kramer, Toh) to ground the concept. It argues that normative content emerges not only through rational justification but through the structured conventions and rule-bound institutional practices of actual legal systems. This anchors the theory more concretely in legal practice.

#### 4. **Role of Convergence**

* Habermas’s discourse ethics and related theories stress consensus achieved explicitly through argumentative processes.

* **Act Speech**, in contrast, accounts for convergence that arises implicitly through repetitive, symbolic, ritualistic, and conventionalized actions, even without explicit discursive argumentation. Thus, Act Speech is uniquely positioned to explain how law persists through habitual practices that do not require continuous explicit linguistic reaffirmation or debate.

---

### **Philosophical Rigorousness and Scholarly Credibility**

The theoretical originality of Act Speech—relative to existing conversational theories—lies in rigorously synthesizing insights from:

* Philosophy of action (Searle, Austin, Brandom)
* Legal positivism and meta-jurisprudence (Hart, Kelsen, Toh, Duarte d’Almeida)
* Contemporary expressivist theories (Kevin Toh’s Hartian expressivism, Finlay and Plunkett’s quasi-expressivism)
* Institutional theory (Matthew Kramer’s institutional positivism, Brian Leiter’s methodological insights)

By combining these elements, Act Speech extends the explanatory depth of conventional discourse theories and offers greater interdisciplinary potential within analytic jurisprudence.

Nevertheless, precisely because there is substantial overlap, explicit acknowledgment of these similarities and clear articulation of what specifically is original or additive would enhance its scholarly rigor and clarity.

### **Recommendation for the Paper**

To ensure that your analysis is rigorously distinguished from conventional discourse theory, the paper should explicitly address the following points:

* Clarify how Act Speech differs from linguistic communication (Habermas, Brandom) or conversational implicature (Grice).
* Clearly articulate how institutional rules and practices constitute normative meanings independently from explicit linguistic discourse.
* Emphasize cases where conventional discourse theory is insufficient, particularly legislative rituals, judicial symbolism, or widespread law-abiding behavior.
* Clearly position Act Speech within the existing meta-jurisprudential landscape, addressing the critical literature directly (Raz, Kramer, Leiter, Toh, Duarte d’Almeida).
* Argue explicitly how Act Speech overcomes potential objections (like conflating interpretation with constitution or confusing intentional meaning with mere behavioral regularity).

This will clarify the theoretical value of your argument and ensure it is distinguished clearly and rigorously from existing theories.

---

**Conclusion**

Your analysis of Act Speech indeed shares features with discourse or conversational theories but also offers critical points of distinction, especially in:

* Recognizing **non-linguistic normative expression**.
* Emphasizing **constitutive conventions over mere interpretative consensus**.
* Incorporating **institutional and ritualized elements** of law explicitly and systematically.

To preserve analytical rigor and scholarly credibility, the paper should clearly articulate these distinctions. Doing so would enhance the theoretical significance of Act Speech and distinguish it sharply from existing conversational and discourse theories.

**Justifying Act Speech Theory Beyond Legal Positivism and Legal Realism**

The theory of *Act Speech* advances a novel account of legal existence by anchoring legal normativity not in propositional attitudes or rule-following behavior, but in expressive actions that instantiate and sustain legal meaning. In doing so, it seeks to resolve foundational tensions between legal positivism, legal realism, and interpretivist theories such as that of Ronald Dworkin. What distinguishes Act Speech is its constitutive thesis: that certain institutionalized actions function not merely as vehicles for expressing legal meaning, but as the very acts by which legal norms are brought into being.

Legal positivism, particularly as articulated by H.L.A. Hart, grounds the existence of law in social practices and rule-based convergence among officials. Yet the rule of recognition, which Hart posits as the foundational conventional rule for identifying valid laws, leaves unexplained how such conventions themselves acquire normative authority. Hart contends that the internal point of view suffices, yet critics have noted that this invocation of acceptance does not account for the dynamic and performative dimensions of legal life. The *Act Speech* framework offers an explanatory advance by showing how legal practices are normatively constituted through public, recognizable, and institutionally ratified expressive acts. It replaces Hart's epistemically opaque "acceptance" with a more structured account of how recognition operates within socially embedded systems of performative interaction.

Legal realism, on the other hand, correctly identifies that the application and development of law are contingent upon the discretionary actions of judges and officials. However, it often collapses normative authority into sociological facticity or behavioral regularity. The *Act Speech* model avoids this pitfall by treating expressive legal actions not as mere social outcomes but as normatively inflected performances. The theory acknowledges contingency and indeterminacy while preserving the possibility of normative evaluation by anchoring legal meaning in the successful expression of institutionally regulated acts. These acts are neither reducible to psychological intentions nor to behavioral regularities, but instead depend on the felicity conditions analogous to those found in speech act theory (Austin; Searle), extended into legal practice.

Interpretivist theories such as Dworkin's present a powerful challenge to positivist accounts by arguing that law is best understood as an interpretive enterprise, wherein judges seek the morally best justification of legal practices. Yet interpretivism faces the difficulty of anchoring legal obligation in a shared practice without collapsing into either subjectivism or moral realism. *Act Speech* preserves Dworkin's insight about the meaning-laden nature of legal practice while avoiding the epistemological burdens of moral objectivity. It grounds legal normativity in publicly observable acts that satisfy criteria of institutional intelligibility and uptake, thereby offering an intersubjective yet non-metaphysical account of normativity.

In sum, the *Act Speech* theory provides a philosophically robust alternative that integrates the strengths of prior theories while addressing their weaknesses. It affirms the performative constitution of law, clarifies the mechanisms of social recognition, and provides a conceptually precise framework for understanding legal existence as dependent upon expressive acts that are both institutional and normative. By reframing recognition as an expressive rather than merely epistemic phenomenon, *Act Speech* yields a richer, more actionable account of legal normativity consistent with the best traditions of analytic jurisprudence.
