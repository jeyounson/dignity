# 2. The Fragility of Dignity

In Chapter 1 I laid out, in an abstract and general way, the central components of my theory of dignity. In this chapter I'll start to show what work this theory can do. This is part of the overarching argumentative structure of the book: the theory of dignity I'm presenting is a viable one, I'm claiming, because it is useful for making sense of our moral lives. The key way in which the theory is useful is that it highlights the extent to which dignity is *fragile*: it can be damaged, and even destroyed, by the actions or inactions of others.[^1]

To say that dignity is fragile does not yet tell us much, though. The goal of this chapter is thus to unpack three distinct ways in which dignity is fragile—it can be violated; it can be frustrated; and it can be destroyed—and work through each of these categories, exploring how they manifest for the three strands of dignity. In the remaining chapters I will build on this framework to consider the scope of dignitarian claims; that is, under what conditions do we owe it to others not to violate, frustrate, or destroy their dignity?

## 1. Violations of Dignity

Consider the following three examples:

> A) The American Police put red women's underwear over my head and then tied me to the window in my cell with my hands behind my back until I lost consciousness. . . .Then two officers tied my hands to the door while laying down on my stomach. One of the police was pissing on me and laughing. . . . And one of the police he put a part of his stick that he always carries inside my ass and I felt it going inside me about 2 centimeters. And I started screaming and he pulled it out. . . and the two American girls that were there when they were beating me, they were hitting me with a ball made of sponge on my dick. . . and one of the girls was playing with my dick . . .And they were taking pictures of me during all these instances. (Detainee 151365, cited in Rothe, *State Criminality*, p. 123)

B) They called it the *épuration sauvage*, the wild purge, because it was spontaneous and unofficial. . . .The victims were among the most vulnerable members of the community: Women. Accused of "horizontal collaboration" sleeping with the enemy—they were targeted by vigilantes and publicly humiliated. Their heads were shaved, they were stripped half-naked, smeared with tar, paraded through towns and taunted, stoned, kicked, beaten, spat upon and sometimes even killed.

One photograph from the era shows a woman standing in a village as two men forcibly restrain her wrists; a third man grabs a hank of her blonde hair, his scissors poised to hack it away. (Mah 2018)

C) [W]hen you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six-year-old daughter why she cannot go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her little eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see the depressing clouds of inferiority begin to form in her little mental sky [. . .]; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading "white" and "colored"; when your first name becomes "nigger" and your middle name becomes "boy" (however old you are) and your last name becomes "John," and when your wife and mother are never given the respected title "Mrs."…; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of "nobodyness"—then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. (Martin Luther King, Jr., Letter from Birmingham Jail)

Whatever else we might be tempted to say about violations of dignity, these three cases ought to qualify as paradigms. Torture, public shaming, and Jim Crow laws each, in their own particular way, violate the dignity of those subjected to them. *How* they violate dignity, though, and the harms that follow from that violation, are not necessarily the same. Whatever torture, public shaming, and segregation have in common, it would be a mistake to offer an analysis that construes their effect on dignity in an undifferentiated way. My theory of dignity has been constructed in order to be able to make sense of both what ties examples like these together, and what differentiates them. We thus need to consider dignity violations through three separate lenses: personal dignity, social dignity, and status dignity.

### 1.1 Personal Dignity Violations

To violate someone's personal dignity, I propose, is to make her transgress a subjective dignitarian norm. More precisely, to violate someone's personal dignity is to make her do or be something she takes to be disgraceful or debasing.

Example A above offers a prime example of a personal dignity violation, as does torture more generally, in large part because of its embodied nature. So often during torture, the body, which is usually covered, is presented stripped bare, and control over bodily functions is impaired, if not lost altogether. As Jay Bernstein notes,

> It is a constant in the literature on torture . . .that it is the victim, not the torturer, who carries the burden of shame, since it is the victim who experiences his body as no longer his, a beyond control, as if the wrenching shamefulness of being unable to publically control one's natural bodily functions—being unable to publically control bladder or bowel—now attaches to one's body *as a whole*, one's body as a whole becoming an involuntary thing, a thing spasms, howls, leaks, bursting and shriveling, all as automatic responses to the prod, poke, punch, slap of the torturer. It is humiliation without relief. (Bernstein 2015, 101)

That torture is so often described as a violation of dignity is straightforwardly explicable, on my account: the humiliation Bernstein points to indicates the transgression of a subjective dignitarian norm. The tortured person is made to do or be something she finds degrading, whether that's losing control of her bowels, whimpering in abject terror, or betraying those dearest to her.

The tight connection between torture and personal dignity violations is far from incidental. This becomes clear if we reflect on the purpose of torture. Modern torture, it is widely agreed, aims to *break* its victims, as a means of getting them to transmit information.[^2] This goal is made explicit in the CIA's (now declassified) Kubark Counterintelligence Manual: "It is a fundamental hypothesis of this handbook that these techniques...are in essence methods of inducing regression of the personality to whatever earlier and weaker level is required for the dissolution of resistance" (CIA July 1963).

This "breaking" has both a psychological and a physical component. On the psychological side, an individual is broken when she can no longer resist her interrogator's demands—that is, when she gives him the information he demands. On the physical side, an individual is broken when her body ceases to function. Both the psychological and the physical breaking torture aims at can be understood in terms of betrayal: the individual betrays her political cause or her loved ones through the provision of information; the body betrays the individual through loss of control of basic functions. Either of these forms of betrayal, in turn, can be understood in terms of dignitarian norms. Here is how Richard Rorty astutely summarizes the purpose of modern torture: "The idea is to get her to do or say things—and, if possible, believe and desire things, think thoughts—which later she will be unable to cope with having done or thought" (Rorty 1989, 177–8). This inability to cope with having done or thought something is indicative of having done or thought something one finds utterly disgraceful: it is to have had one's personal dignity egregiously violated.[^3]

On the bodily side, the extremes in which a detainee's body is placed when she is tortured frequently leave her incapable of controlling basic bodily functions, such as urination and defecation. As noted above, our bodies are prime sites of dignitarian norms—to urinate on oneself is the kind of thing many of us would find debasing.[^4] Importantly, the physical and psychological aspects of breaking are intimately connected, as Norbert Gurris explains:

> It no longer fits into our familiar maps of thought and evaluation for a grown human being to become completely helpless, to cry or beg for mercy, to void the bowels and pass urine in the panic of uncontrolled anxiety [. . .] Under these circumstances, naked biological survival can lead the tortured person to betray anyone and everything. (Gurris 2001, 31)

A detainee is thus often psychologically broken *through* being physically broken. The personal dignity violation is then twofold: the detainee's dignity is violated in the moment her body betrays her, and is violated again if she seeks to recover her bodily dignity by giving her captors what they want i.e. by betraying her cause.

The propensity of torture to turn sexual is highly relevant to personal dignity violations. As was highlighted in example A, prisoners at Abu Ghraib were routinely subject to sexual humiliation. This testimony is confirmed by another Detainee, 151108, who relates, "They stripped me of all my clothes, even my underwear. They gave me women's underwear. . . and they put a bag over my face. One of them whispered in my ear, 'today I am going to fuck you' " (cited in Rothe 2009, 124). Detainee 150422 suffered a similar experience: "The evening shift was sad for prisoners. They brought three prisoners handcuffed to each other and they pushed the first one on top of the others to look like they are gay" (cited in Rothe 2009, 124). Such acts are precisely targeted at the detainees' sexual mores; they are designed to make the detainees feel debased. As Kate Millett astutely notes, "The victim tortured sexually is tortured twice, as it were, first by being deliberately harmed, second by being harmed in a way regarded as the most humiliating of all humiliations" (Millett 1995, 35).

My claim that torture—whether sexual or otherwise—is a paradigmatic form of personal dignity violation does raise the following worry. Since personal dignity is only violated if an agent takes what she does to be debasing, my account seems to have the implication that victims of torture only have their dignity violated if they believe themselves to have done something wrong. This has worrying implications not only for torture, but also for sexual assault. Both of these are phenomena that clearly violate personal dignity, but just as clearly those subject to them ought not to take themselves to be in any way at fault.

To address this worry, we need to get clearer on the nature of dignitarian norms. To recap, the relevant kind of dignitarian norms are ones the agent takes it to be debasing to contravene. To be debased is to do or be something that damages one's standing in one's own eyes: it is to reduce one's estimation of oneself. This way of phrasing things is, however, ambiguous between two distinct claims. On the one hand, to say that the agent takes herself to be subject to a norm that it would be disgraceful to transgress might mean that the agent *judges that she ought to* lower her self-regard if she contravenes the norms. Moral and religious standards do often have this character—they are internalized in the deep sense that the agent takes them to be appropriate markers of her virtue. On the other hand, though, for an agent to take something to be debasing might just mean that she is *likely to* lower her self-regard if she contravenes the standard. Here, to say that the agent takes something to be debasing is to say that she has a disposition to think less of herself if she does that thing. An agent need not reflectively endorse the claim that she is less worthy of self-respect if she soils herself in response to horrific torture, for her to be disposed to think less of herself in such a situation.

In order to capture the full range of phenomena in which people feel their dignity has been violated, I propose a disjunctive reading of dignitarian standards. That is, personal dignity can be violated if an agent is made to do something she *judges to be debasing*, where that means she takes it to be appropriate to lower her self-regard in light of the transgression; or if she is made to do something she is *disposed to respond to with lowered self-regard*, irrespective of her reflective judgment.[^5]

Incorporating a dispositional reading of dignitarian norms avoids two significant problems. First, it avoids the risk of tying dignity violations too closely to actual psychological responses. Consider someone who is sexually humiliated while she is asleep or unconscious: surely her personal dignity is violated irrespective of whether she ever becomes aware of what has happened, and hence independently of her actual self-regard. We can make sense of this judgment if we allow that it's sufficient for the agent to be *disposed* to think less of herself if such things are done to her. Second, a dispositional approach avoids the risk of over-moralizing dignity violations. If being anally raped only counts as a personal dignity violation if the victim reflectively endorses the claim that he ought to think less of himself for being subject to such an act, then he would be open to the accusation that his dignity is only violated because he endorses morally indefensible norms. This will be particularly relevant when agents feel violated for acts that others of us might be strongly opposed to construing as debasing—whether that's being anally penetrated, wearing women's underwear, or mimicking gay sex, all of which, as we've seen, were common practices at Abu Ghraib. Incorporating the dispositional reading of dignitarian norms frees us from the demand to justify the appropriateness of our shame responses.

While including a dispositional reading renders it less appropriate to demand of the most vulnerable that they justify the appropriateness of their shame responses, it is important to stress that the theory nonetheless holds someone's dignity to have been violated if they *do* hold themselves to dignitarian standards that others of us might find to be noxious. This observation might incline us to reject the morally neutral construal of dignity I am offering here. Such an inclination, I hope to show, ought to be resisted—we have good reason for keeping our account of dignity, and what it means for dignity to be damaged, morally neutral. This is necessary to capture the full range of ways in which individuals are *harmed* through violations of their dignity, irrespective of the objective truths of the norms in play. We can see the import of keeping the account of dignity morally neutral by comparing Avishai Margalit's conception of humiliation.[^6] On his account, "[humiliation is] any sort of behavior or condition that constitutes *a sound reason* for a person to consider his or her self-respect injured (Margalit 2009, 9 emphasis added)." As Daniel Statman (2000) points out, this entails that someone only counts as humiliated if they *ought* to lose self-respect. Since we presumably ought not to think less of ourselves for what others force us to endure, Margalit's account struggles to account for the humiliation suffered in contexts such as torture. More broadly, it holds the wrong of humiliation hostage to a theory of the legitimate grounds of self-respect: since our self-respect presumably *ought* to be sensitive only to what we voluntarily do, most paradigmatic cases of humiliation, which involve forcing the victim to do something against her will, do not meet Margalit's criterion. In this respect I follow Statman, who holds that "humiliation is any behavior that makes a person think she is unworthy, or less worthy, of respect, according to her own standards" (Statman 2000, 527).

While the disjunction between reflective endorsement and dispositions is important, it is also worth noting that the relationship between endorsement and disposition can be fluid. For instance, an individual might reflectively endorse the claim that it is disgraceful to submit to denigrating treatment without resistance, and hence that she ought to think less of herself if she were to do so. But this endorsement could also make it more likely that she is disposed to think less of herself if she is subjected to denigrating treatment, even when resistance is impossible. Likewise, an individual might reflectively endorse the claim that it is debasing to perform sex acts in public, but this endorsement could make it more likely that she is disposed to think less of herself if she is a victim of revenge porn, even though in such a case she hasn't actually performed a sex act in public. In other words, our reflective judgments about what kinds of behavior ought to make us think less of ourselves can bleed into broader and less context-sensitive dispositions to think less of ourselves.

So far I have focused on torture, because it is such a clear case of making someone transgress their own dignitarian norms. However, torture is not the only context in which violations of personal dignity are rampant. Though otherwise worlds apart from the torture chamber, hospitals and nursing homes are also places in which individuals frequently feel compelled to protest violations of their dignity. As with torture, the salience of embodiment can help explain the connection between medical care and personal dignity violations. Consider the following anecdote:

> Mary Duffy was lying in bed half-asleep on the morning after her breast cancer surgery in February when a group of white-coated strangers filed into her hospital room.

Without a word, one of them—a man—leaned over Ms. Duffy, pulled back her blanket, and stripped her nightgown from her shoulders.

Weak from the surgery, Ms. Duffy, 55, still managed to exclaim, 'Well, good morning,' a quiver of sarcasm in her voice.

But the doctor ignored her. He talked about carcinomas and circled her bed like a presenter at a lawnmower trade show, while his audience, a halfdozen medical students in their 20's, stared at Ms. Duffy's naked body with detached curiosity, she said.

After what seemed an eternity, the doctor abruptly turned to face her. "Have you passed gas yet?" he asked. (Carey 2005)

The connection between embodiment and personal dignity violations is even more succinctly articulated by a respondent to a survey on patient dignity. According to "Mr F": "How dignity's compromised is these gowns you wear are wide open at the back aren't they?" (cited in Baillie 2009).

The mortification patients such as Mary and Mr F feel in these kinds of circumstances is indicative of a personal dignity violation. Even though they have not, strictly speaking, been made to *do* anything, the circumstances they find themselves in are likely to induce a kind of shame that is analogous (albeit far less egregious) to that experienced in the torture chamber.

There are, of course, important differences between torture and hospitalization. This difference does not just lie in the intentionality of the dignity violation, but also in how we ought to understand what's involved in *making* someone transgress a dignitarian norm. Torture compels through *force*: agents' bodies are stressed until they soil themselves, or betray their cause, or both; or they are raped, stripped, or otherwise sexually abused. When patients report that their dignity is violated in healthcare settings, they more commonly report something closer to *indifference*. Patients are left naked on hospital trolleys, in full view of the public; they are required to toilet with an open door to allow nurses to simultaneously attend to other tasks; they are placed in mixed gender wards and not provided with the means to secure their bodily privacy; and so on.

Patients readily invoke the language of dignity violation to describe such situations. However, in most of these cases it would be inaccurate to say they are being *coerced* into transgressing the relevant norms. Rather, what occurs in healthcare settings is more commonly that agents are *denied the means* to uphold those norms, at precisely the time in which they are most in need of assistance to do so: their clothes are taken away from them, and they are not provided with non-shameful alternatives; they are required to toilet in ways that prevent them from achieving their desired level of privacy; their bodily functions start to fail, and they cannot control how public these failures are. Within healthcare settings, personal dignity is typically violated when those who are responsible for our care fail to assist us in upholding our own personal standards. When we are old or infirm, we rely on others to help us maintain bodily privacy, toilet in appropriate ways, and appear clean and appropriately dressed for visitors. When we do not get the assistance we need to uphold those standards, from the very people tasked with our care, it is appropriate to say that our personal dignity is violated.

I have suggested that personal dignity is violated either when an agent is forced to transgress her own dignitarian norms, or when she is prevented from upholding those norms. Humiliation and torture are paradigm examples of the former kind of personal dignity violation; neglectful healthcare is a paradigm example of the latter kind of personal dignity violation. I'll close out this section by considering a couple of further contexts in which personal dignity violations are likely to occur.

One of the most poignant scenes in the Ken Loach film *I, Daniel Blake* occurs when Katie, a struggling young single mother, visits a food bank with her friend Daniel and her two young children. Having been skipping meals in order to ensure her children are fed, Katie finds herself so overcome with hunger that she retreats to a quiet corner, rips the lid off a can of baked beans, and starts to devour them with her bare hands. Katie's abject shame when she is spotted by the staff at the food bank is palpable. Clearly, such an act is one that Katie finds disgraceful—this is not the kind of thing she can do and look herself in the eye afterwards. While everyone at the food bank treats Katie with nothing but kindness and respect, this does not suffice to protect her personal dignity: poverty compels her to transgress her own dignitarian norms, leading to a profound loss of self-respect.

There are many additional ways in which poverty poses an acute threat to personal dignity. Poverty can compel people to do work they find degrading, whether that's sex work or sweatshop labor; welfare systems can require people in poverty to abase themselves before social workers in order to receive essential benefits;[^7] poverty can leave people unable to purchase essential sanitary items, such as tampons, rendering them unable to appear in public without shame (a particularly acute problem when combined with homelessness);[^8] and poverty can leave people unable to participate in basic social practices with friends and family, such as paying one's share of a dinner bill, or buying children a Christmas present.

To clarify, it is not *necessarily* the case that such circumstances violate a person's dignity—that depends on the precise nature of the dignitarian norms people have internalized. Given the cultural contexts in which many people are raised, though, it is unsurprising that they find their self-respect compromised when they have to explain to their kids why there are no presents this year, or when they have to grovel to a bureaucrat in order to put food on the table, or when they find themselves in a public place in bloodstained trousers.

Here's just one example, from a woman forced to disclose intimate details of her illness: "It is a special kind of shame when you realise how powerless you are in a room where the other person can remove your only source of money. I wanted the appointment to be over and I wanted to eat, so I relented. I was horrified. This man forced details out of me I have not told close friends and moreover saw nothing wrong with it" (Naujokas 2019).

The final context for dignity violations worth noting involves nonconsensual sexual interactions, including both sexual harassment and sexual assault. It is commonplace to note that people who have been raped report extensive feelings of shame afterwards. This suggests being raped is something many people find debasing—it threatens their self-respect. Of course, sexual assault need not amount to rape for it to constitute a dignity violation. Consider the recent revelations about comedian Louis C.K., who it has emerged invited numerous women in the comedy business to watch or listen to him masturbate. *The New York Times* (2017) reports of one of the women, Ms. Schachner, "For years afterward. . .she felt angry and betrayed by an artist she looked up to. And she wondered what she could have done differently. 'I felt very ashamed,' she said." Victims of revenge porn reveal similar attitudes. A young woman in Ireland says of her discovery that her ex-boyfriend had posted explicit photos and videos of her to a porn site: "My immediate reaction was to throw up, because how do you process that? It was a complete violation of everything . . . .It made me feel disgusting and completely vulnerable" (cited in McCormack 2016). Subjecting someone to a strip-search, whether on the street or in prison, can also constitute a violation of personal dignity, and is sometimes undertaken for just this purpose. Here's how Yvonne Smith describes her experience of routine strip-searches at Valley State prison for women, which were performed every time prisoners were taken to shower:

They don't do this because of "safety and security of the institution," they do it for humiliation. Some of them really like it. There is nothing we can do between our cells and the shower, no way we can pick anything up. They're with us, watching us the whole time. They are just tryin' to break us down. (cited in Guenther 2013, 190)

Like torture, sexual harassment and sexual assault frequently aims at violating its target's personal dignity: it is intended to induce feelings of disgrace and thereby damage the target's self-respect. Even when that intention is lacking, though, the strong propensity for sexual norms to have a dignitarian inflection mean that such actions typically result in personal dignity violations.

As with poverty, there is not a *necessary* connection between sexual assault and personal dignity violations, since this depends on the precise content of the agent's dignitarian norms. Acknowledging this contingency of many personal dignity violations may encourage the troubling thought that we can secure our dignity by altering our dignitarian norms. Of course, since those norms need not be reflectively endorsed, such an alteration couldn't be brought about simply by reasoning through the appropriate grounds for self-respect. Nonetheless, our dignitarian norms could, presumably, be altered through socialization. In many cases, I believe, this would be a good thing: the fewer people feel ashamed as a result of being sexually assaulted, the better. Were such a change to take place, however, I would be committed to saying sexual assault no longer constituted a personal dignity violation. This might seem like a counterintuitive claim, even after acknowledging that it would of course continue to be an egregious moral wrong on independent grounds. Once we supplement our analysis of personal dignity violations with consideration of social and status dignity violations, though—and especially once we get clear on the nature of the harms that attaches to each—it's a claim we ought to be comfortable making.

### 1.2 Social Dignity Violations

We can make a start on grasping the nature of social dignity violations by seeing them as structurally analogous to personal dignity violations. To have one's socially dignity violated, we might say, is to be made to do or be something that is taken to be debasing or degrading by one's community. More precisely, it's to be made to do or be something that *lowers one in the eyes of one's peers*. This accords with how Judge Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice interprets the idea of degrading treatment in Article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which he ties tightly to the idea of dignity:

[I]n the present context it can be assumed that [degrading treatment] is, or should be, intended to denote something seriously humiliating, lowering as to human dignity, or disparaging, like having one's head shaved, being tarred and feathered, smeared with filth, pelted with muck, paraded naked in front of strangers, forced to eat excreta, deface the portrait of one's sovereign or head of State, or dress up in a way calculated to provoke ridicule or contempt. (cited in McCrudden 2008, 686)

Public shaming is thus a core way in which social dignity can be so violated.[^9]

A clean, because fictional, example of social dignity violation through public shaming occurs in an episode of *Game of Thrones*, and it will be helpful to start here. The Queen mother, Cersei, has confessed to adultery. As penance, a powerful religious sect in the city forces her to do a "walk of atonement"—her head is shaved, she is stripped naked, and she is forced to walk through the jeering crowds. What makes this such a paradigmatic example of public shaming is how transparent the intentions of the religious faction are: as part of a power struggle with the ruling family, the religious sect is seeking to reduce Cersei's standing in the eyes of the people of the city. Whereas before she had been held in a kind of awe, now she is reduced to an object of public ridicule, and those who previously would not have dared so much as address her now shout derogatory comments about her body, and throw rotten food at her.

What also makes this example useful is how clearly it cleaves personal dignity apart from social dignity. Cersei is not the kind of women to feel ashamed of her own body, or of her sexuality. If her self-respect were the target, forcing her to walk naked through the city would not be a particularly effective tool. Even if we stipulate that Cersei's personal dignity remains intact through this episode—nothing that is done to her transgresses any of own dignitarian norms; nothing that is done to her is the kind of thing that she finds disgraceful—it is nonetheless clear that the walk of atonement is a dignity violation. This is because the walk of atonement is designed with *social* dignitarian norms in mind: in this society, those who appear stripped naked in public places invite the disdain of others.

Of course, social dignity violations will often also be personal dignity violations, insofar as personal dignitarian norms are drawn from our social contexts. Nonetheless, it is crucial to keep them conceptually distinct, for two reasons. First, in order to get a complete picture of how we are harmed when our dignity is violated, and hence the scope of claims *against* having one's dignity violated, we must attend to personal and social dignity violations separately, even when these occur through one and the same act. Second, while personal and social dignity violations often occur together, they can nonetheless come apart. Of particular relevance here is dignity in healthcare settings. While hospitalization often threatens personal dignity, as we saw above, other sites of healthcare are better examined through the framework of social dignity. This is especially true for the care of individuals with profound cognitive impairments. In short: even if an individual lacks personal dignity, because they do not have the kind of self-conception that grounds personal dignity, they can nonetheless be vulnerable to social dignity violations—they can be made to do or be something that lowers them in the eyes of the community.

Eva Kittay (2005, 110) relates a poignant story involving her daughter, Sesha, and the agency director at Sesha's care home, that brings out this point. The director was apparently horrified to find Sesha being wheeled through a public space wrapped just in a towel, describing it as an offense to her dignity. She then recalled how things used to be at the home she worked at in the '60s, where "ten to twelve naked men were marched through the dormitory into a large room and unceremoniously hosed down." Let's stipulate what may very well not be true, i.e. that Sesha and these men lack personal dignity—they hold themselves to no dignitarian norms. Nonetheless, what is done to them would be a dignity violation. It merits this description, on my account, because making someone enter public space without clothing is to make them do something debasing, according to the standards of the broader societies in which they live. Social dignity is thus especially salient in care home settings. Residents of care homes are highly dependent on their carers to ensure they are present in public spaces in ways that do not undermine their social standing; that is, to ensure they are provided with the necessary scaffolding to enable them to meet the broader public's dignitarian norms. To allow a client to take a public outing in soiled clothes, for instance, or to urinate in public, is to allow her to do something the general public deems disgraceful, and hence to undermine her social standing. It is to violate her social dignity.

While a useful start, understanding social dignity violations as strictly analogous to personal dignity violations, as I've been doing so far, falls short of what we need. That it is insufficient becomes clear if we turn to a real-life case that in many ways parallels the example from *Game of Thrones*. As described in Example B at the opening of this chapter, following the German occupation of France numerous French women were publicly shamed for having (purportedly) consorted with German soldiers, and this included shaving their heads to "mark" them as traitors. This, too, seems a paradigmatic case of dignity violation, and its social nature is indisputable. Indeed, its parallels with the fictional case of Queen Cersei are manifest. Nonetheless, it would be awkward to force this example into the mold of the definition given above, namely being made to transgress a social dignitarian norm. Whatever public attitudes at the time were to women having shaved heads, *that* is not the norm relevant to their public shaming. Rather, the shaved heads stood in for the norm violation that *was* supposed to invite public disdain, namely having consorted with German soldiers. Here, then, we cannot plausibly describe the situation as one in which a person is made to transgress social dignitarian norms.[^10] Rather, what's salient about this case, and what needs to be incorporated into the definition of social dignity violations, is the way in which the public is *invited to view the women with disdain*. Since to *have* social dignity is to command social appraisal respect, it is appropriate to understand social dignity violations in terms of the attempted *undermining* of social appraisal respect. We can thus broaden the definition of social dignity violations to the following: to have one's social dignity violated is to be *presented as* having transgressed a social dignitarian norm, thus inviting the disdain of the community. To make someone transgress a social norm is thus just one—albeit central—way in which social dignity can be violated.

This expanded definition also ensures the account can capture further types of public shaming that would be excluded on the stricter definition. Consider a case of revenge porn in which the images are doctored to show the victim performing degrading sex acts that she never actually performed. Here, there is no actual agent who has transgressed the relevant social dignitarian norms.[^11] Nonetheless, the victim's dignity has been violated. The expanded definition accommodates such cases, since they involve the perpetrator *presenting* the victim as having violated the social dignitarian norms, thereby inviting the disdain of the community.

Even more troubling, an individual's social dignity can be violated, not because of what she is presented as having *done*, but because of what she is presented as *being*. If a society is such that an entire social identity is construed as debased, then merely existing in such a society can be a perpetual social dignity violation. The following famous passage from Frantz Fanon (1986) devastatingly captures this experience:

> "Look at the nigger!. . .Mama, a Negro!. . .Hell, he's getting mad. . . .Take no notice, sir, he does not know that you are as civilized as we. . . . "

My body was given back to me sprawled out, distorted, recolored, clad in mourning in that white winter day. The Negro is an animal, the Negro is bad, the Negro is mean, the Negro is ugly; look, a nigger, it's cold, the nigger is shivering, the nigger is shivering because he is cold, the little boy is trembling because he is afraid of the nigger, the nigger is shivering with cold, that cold that goes through your bones, the handsome little boy is trembling because he thinks that the nigger is quivering with rage, the little white boy throws himself into his mother's arms: Mama, the nigger's going to eat me up. (pp. 85–6)

Fanon continues, "And already I am being dissected under white eyes, the only real eyes. I am *fixed*. (p. 87). To be seen, on Fanon's account, is always already to be debased. This accords with the gendered account of shame developed by Sandra Bartky. According to Bartky, "[s]hame is the distressed apprehension of the self as inadequate or diminished" (Bartky 1990, 86). As Bartky goes on to stress, such an apprehension is not a temporary "blip" on the psychic landscape, but rather a "perpetual attunement, the pervasive affective taste of a life" (p. 96).[^12]

There is one more type of case it is worth noting, before moving on to status dignity violations. Recall a detail from Detainee 151365, cited in Example A above, where he says of the sexual torture inflicted on him at Abu Ghraib: "*And they were taking pictures of me during all these instances.*" Now even though those pictures may never have been intended to see the light of day, *that* they were taken, and that the detainees *knew* they were being taken, is significant. As we'll see in Chapter 3, the primary harm of social dignity violations is a loss of social standing, which comes from being publicly shamed. An important secondary harm, though, is the *feeling* of being publicly shamed. That feeling, importantly, can come apart from the *fact* of being publicly shamed. The threat of being presented as having transgressed social dignitarian norms can thus be sufficient to incur one of the central harms of social dignity violations. When it comes time to consider the claims we have against our dignity being violated, it will be important to also include cases in which we merely *believe* our dignity has been violated, since these will carry some of the very same harms as actual dignity violations. So while Detainee 151365's social dignity was not necessarily violated just in virtue of his having been photographed (which is not to say, of course, that his social dignity was not violated in other ways, nor that his personal and status dignity were not violated by the act of photographing), his *belief* that his social dignity was being violated through the act of photography aggravated the other harms inflicted upon him.

### 1.3 Status Dignity Violations

Let's turn now to status dignity violations. Unlike personal and social dignity violations, violations of status dignity do not render the target any less dignified, though they do threaten her dignity. This is a key difference between personal and social dignity, on the one hand, and status dignity, on the other. Personal and social dignity come in degrees, with individuals able to exhibit dignity to a greater or lesser extent, in accordance with how much appraisal respect they command in virtue of (being seen to be) upholding the relevant norms. To violate someone's personal or social dignity, in as much as it involves making her transgress the relevant norms, is to render her less personally or socially dignified. Status dignity, by contrast, does not come in degrees. Or, more precisely, any given instantiation of status dignity does not come in degrees. To have status dignity is to be entitled to a certain form of recognition respect, in virtue of one's membership in a particular community. While some communities might bestow more extravagant forms of recognition respect on members than others—and hence we could say that members of that group have "more" status dignity than members of other groups—the status dignity that individuals possess in virtue of their membership in any given community does not differ, either between individuals, or for one individual over time in light of her behavior.[^13] Status dignity can, however, be threatened, which is precisely what happens when an individual's status dignity is violated.

To violate someone's status dignity, I propose, is to fail to treat her in accordance with the recognition respect to which she is due. Some examples will help elucidate this idea, and draw out the contrast with social dignity violations. Here's how Jean Hampton describes the difference between *diminishing* treatment, which reduces someone's status, and *demeaning* treatment, which doesn't:

> A prince who is mistaken for a pauper and who therefore fails to receive royal treatment will regard this treatment as demeaning, not because he will believe or even worry that the treatment literally . . . causes him to lose his princely status, but because he will believe the treatment is too low for him *given* that princely status. (cited in Bird 2014, 164)

The prince is owed a certain kind of deference, in accordance with the norms governing his social status as a prince. To fail to receive that deference is a violation of his status dignity, *qua* prince, even though his status as a prince is not here under threat.

While royalty provide a useful introduction to the idea of status dignity violations, given the relatively explicit nature of the norms that typically surround membership, it does run the risk of trivializing—or perhaps even encouraging, for the republicans amongst us—status dignity violations. Looking politically closer to home can bring out why violations of status dignity can be both relevant and of great moral significance.

Two passages from Brittney Cooper provide moving testaments to the import of status dignity violations, drawing attention to the ways in which Black lives in America are not accorded the recognition respect white citizens can typically take for granted. The first occurs in Cooper's response to the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, the protests following which catapulted the Black Lives Matter movement into the national conscience:

> There is no dignity in lying dead on scorching, hot pavement for four hours. That is *evident*. There are no disciplined acts of resistance that will restore dignity to Michael Brown's life. Only justice can do that. Justice affirms that his life was worth protecting. (Cooper 2014, emphasis in original)

Cooper here draws attention to two distinct phenomena, which I think can fruitfully be understood in terms of violations of Michael Brown's status dignity: first, his body after death was not accorded the respectful treatment citizens are due in the United States; and second, his life was not deemed worthy of judicial protection. Taking for granted, for the moment, that Michael Brown did in fact hold a status such that this treatment is contrary to what he was owed, the circumstances of his death constituted a gross violation of his status dignity, over and above any other injustices it involved.

Unfortunately, the death of Michael Brown was not an isolated incident. Here's Cooper again, this time on the media coverage of the death of Walter Scott, a Black man shot in the back while fleeing from a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina:

> On Sept. 11, 2001, parents called into news stations around the country to ask them to stop re-airing footage of the planes crashing into the Twin Towers. News stations complied. Yet Black children got up and went to school this morning, and went to bed last night with video of a white police officer callously killing a Black man running on loop. What about *our* children? (Cooper 2015)

What Cooper draws attention to here is that news networks established a norm in the wake of 9/11: the respect we owe one another as citizens extends to not making a spectacle of one another's deaths, in part in order to protect children from the terror of death. That norm was not recognized in the case of Walter Scott; making a spectacle of *his* death was deemed appropriate, and the fears of Black children were not considered. This callousness in the face of death, I claim, is in conflict with established norms for what we owe one another as co-citizens, and thus constitutes a violation of the status dignity of both Scott himself, and all those who saw themselves and their loved ones reflected in the images of his death at the hands of the state.

At a very basic level, the recognition respect due to members of virtually all groups, large or small, involves offering some kind of response to pain or distress.[^14] To be "one of us," in other words, is to be such that your pain or distress matters, and we recognize your status *as* a member by, amongst other things, acknowledging and responding to that pain and distress. Because of this, a great many violations of personal or social dignity will also constitute violations of status dignity. Torture, rape, institutional neglect—all of these constitute violations of status dignity, across virtually all communities. And while poverty is not necessarily a violation of status dignity, in and of itself, the way we respond to those in poverty can very much constitute a violation of their status dignity. To step over a homeless person as if they weren't there, for instance, is to fail to accord her one of the most elemental forms of recognition respect we owe one another.

While violations of status dignity are all around us, some may worry that my account is insufficient to capture them all. This is because my account only recognizes someone as *having* status dignity if they are a member of a particular group, and hence owed the associated form of recognition respect. But a great deal of dignity violations involve mistreatment of people who are *excluded* from membership, and whose dignity is violated precisely *by* their exclusion. Recall Example C, from the beginning of this section. Martin Luther King, Jr. is lamenting the indignities of segregation, with its constant reminder of inferior status. Segregation is not easily accommodated within personal or social dignity violations: it does not (necessarily) involve making someone transgress their own dignitarian norms; and it does not (necessarily) involve inviting others to see them as having transgressed social dignitarian norms. If my account were unable to accommodate the claim that Jim Crow laws necessarily violate the *status dignity* of those they single out for exclusionary treatment, then it would be a significant mark against it. However, it is not immediately apparent that my account *can* accommodate this claim: if King was not in fact a citizen, someone might argue, then he was not owed the recognition respect citizens commanded, and hence failure to treat him in accordance with the respect citizens command would not have been a violation of his status dignity.

There are two distinct ways to counter this worry. First, recall the example of the prince being treated as a pauper offered by Hampton. While the excerpt does not clarify *who* is treating the prince as a pauper, we can readily make sense of the idea that it was commoners, and not royalty, who were doing so. But note that if that's right, then those who are violating the prince's dignity do not share the status in question; *they* are not owed the form of recognition respect the prince is entitled to, and yet their failure to accord him such respect constitutes a status dignity violation. This suggests that the scope of our claims to recognition respect do not end at the boundaries of the community within which we are accorded that recognition respect. Rather, we can have a status constituted within one community whose claims extend to those outside that community. In other words, our status can command a certain kind of treatment, both from our co-members *and* from others.

Of course, the respect we command may not extend to literally everybody. Children are often exempt, as (at least sometimes) are distant strangers. Nonetheless, the fact that some outsiders are incapable of violating our status dignity is not to say that *all* outsiders are incapable of violating our status dignity. To determine which outsiders have this power, a useful heuristic is to consider whose failure to treat a certain individual in accordance with the relevant norms would be construed by co-members as disrespectful. As we see in the Hampton case, even paupers have this power with respect to the prince. What's true for royalty is also true for African Americans subject to Jim Crow laws, and for any other oppressed people. The very fact that segregation was construed as a mark of disrespect by African Americans suggests that they held a status, and commanded forms of recognition respect, in virtue of their membership in *their own* communities. Assuming such forms of recognition respect include norms like being interacted with as an adult, and not being threatened with random acts of violence, the kinds of interpersonal interactions and institutional regulations African Americans in the Jim Crow South had to deal with on a day-to-day basis violated their status dignity.

A supplementary way to counter the worry about status dignity's scope is to note that who counts as a member of a given community can—in at least some cases come apart from who others *treat* as a member. This is especially true for communities with formal conditions of membership, such as citizenship. When it comes to African Americans in the Jim Crow South, we thus need to identify two distinct sets of norms: who counted as a citizen; and how citizens ought to have been treated. Who was a citizen depended on who had satisfied the formal requirements laid down by the state.[^15] It did *not* depend on who other members extended the relevant norms of treatment to. How citizens ought to have been treated was a matter both of the law, and of informal norms. To identify the latter we would look for widespread patterns of demands, of the form "I am entitled to *x* because I'm a citizen," or "you can't do *y* to me because I'm a citizen." So here's the central idea: insofar as white Americans in the Jim Crow South would have expected access to various public services, and condemned certain forms of treatment, on the grounds that they were citizens, they generated norms of recognition respect for American citizens. And insofar as the Fourteenth Amendment ensured that African Americans were indeed American citizens, African Americans were entitled to the very same forms of recognition respect as other citizens. The fact that numerous white Americans failed to treat African Americans accordingly is no mark against their possession of the status dignity of citizens; rather, it is testament to the enduring and pervasive violations of their status dignity *qua* citizens. Indeed, as Tarun Khaitan (2011) has argued, we can see the law itself as violating the (status) dignity of African-American citizens, when that law embedded discrimination. He cites the judgment in *Strauder v West Virginia*, which makes this point especially clearly:

> The very fact that colored people are singled out and expressly denied by a statute all right to participate in the administration of the law, as jurors, because of their color, though they are citizens, and may be in other respects fully qualified, is practically a brand upon them, affixed by the law, an assertion of their inferiority. (cited in Khaitan 2011, 6)

It will be helpful to close out this discussion of status dignity with a direct comparison to social dignity violations. Often, social and status dignity violations will co-occur. It is nonetheless fruitful to keep the distinction between them clear. This distinction can be brought into focus if we consider the extent to which the dignity of a cognitively disabled adult is dependent upon her care worker, especially when they enter public space together. One way in which the care worker may violate the dignity of a person in his charge is by failing to ensure her clothing is unsoiled. By allowing her to appear in public space in a way that the broader society deems disgraceful, he is violating her *social* dignity. A second, and distinct, way in which the care worker may violate this woman's dignity is by interacting with her as if she were a toddler, or encouraging others to do so. We live in a society in which adults are accorded a certain form of recognition respect, which is instantiated through subtle and not-so-subtle modes of interaction that differ from our modes of interaction for children.[^16] To treat an adult as a child, then, is to fail to treat her in accordance with her status as an adult. It is to violate her *status dignity*.

## 2. Frustrations of Dignity

I have spent a significant amount of time exploring what it means to say that someone's dignity has been violated. While of central importance, dignity violations do not exhaust the relevant ways in which dignity is fragile. In this section I'll look at a counterpart to dignity violations, which I call *frustrations* of dignity.

As we saw above, violations of personal and social dignity focus on dignitarian norms it would be *debasing to transgress*. Frustrations of personal and social dignity, by contrast, focus on dignitarian norms it would be *ennobling to uphold*. More precisely, to frustrate someone's personal dignity is to prevent her from doing or being something she takes to be ennobling; and to frustrate someone's social dignity is to prevent her from doing or being something that her community takes to be ennobling.[^17]

Consider an individual with a physical disability, who takes pride in preparing her own meals. We can say of such a person that she has a dignitarian norm of independence, at least within this domain—she takes it to be ennobling to prepare her own meals, in the sense that she is disposed to hold herself in higher regard for doing so. If, however, she is placed in a care home where she is prevented from assisting in her own food preparation, a source of personal pride has been taken from her. While her dignity hasn't been necessarily been *violated* (she may well not find it *debasing* to have her meals prepared for her), her dignity has nonetheless been frustrated.

Or consider the prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, carefully crafting artworks from the few scraps they can scavenge in their cells. Some of these artworks have been displayed in New York City, at an exhibit showcasing the work of detainees. In November 2017, however, the US Government claimed ownership of the art: the military is now planning to burn it. Though we can only speculate on the dignitarian norms of Guantanamo detainees, it does not seem a stretch to suppose that, for at least some of them, the creation of artworks, and especially the prospect of them being exhibited, was a profoundly ennobling experience. To either prevent the creation of such art, or to burn it once it is created, is to block one of the very few avenues these detainees have to take pride in something: it frustrates their personal dignity.

Frustrations of social dignity operate in an analogous way. An individual has her social dignity frustrated if she is prevented from upholding social dignitarian norms, thereby being blocked from doing or being something her community takes to be ennobling. To frustrate someone's social dignity thus denies her a mechanism by which she could enhance the esteem in which her community holds her. Frustrations of social dignity will be most apparent in communities which bestow honors (whether formally or informally) on particular members for perceived excellence. Take, for instance, the tradition of Mardi Gras Indians in New Orleans. Each tribe of Indians contains members with a set role—the Spy Boy, the Flag Boy, the Wildman, and most importantly of all, the Big Chief. Come Mardi Gras day, the Big Chief dons an elaborate mask and suit that has taken all year to sew, and parades with his tribe through the streets of New Orleans, battling with other tribes for the honor of being the prettiest. The ritualistic elements of this tradition make it relatively straightforward to identify the social dignitarian norms in play—it is ennobling to mask, and especially ennobling to receive the accolade of being the prettiest. Were the city to prevent such parades from taking place, or were a particular Big Chief prevented from masking for some reason, this would, on my account, constitute a frustration of social dignity.[^18]

Frustrations of status dignity operate slightly differently, in accordance with the shift from appraisal to recognition respect. Rather than preventing an individual from doing or being something ennobling, frustrations of status dignity deny individuals the opportunity to receive the recognition respect they are due. Frustrations of status dignity will sometimes correlate with frustrations of social dignity. The previous example of the Big Chief being prevented from masking is one such case. While preventing the Big Chief from masking blocks him from doing something ennobling, it also blocks him from receiving expressions of recognition respect. To mask is to engage in a practice that involves others responding to one in accordance with one's assigned role—it is to receive forms of recognition respect appropriate for one's status. For a Big Chief (or any other Indian) be prevented from masking, then, is for them to be blocked from experiencing a form of status dignity.

Frustrations of status dignity also go hand in hand with sexism. When women are discouraged or prevented from fulfilling public roles, or fully engaging in civic life, they are simultaneously denied the opportunity to receive forms of recognition respect they are due *qua* citizens. Likewise, if women are discouraged or prevented from participating in certain religious or cultural practices, they are simultaneously denied the opportunity to receive forms of recognition respect they are due *qua* their religious or cultural identities. To receive recognition respect is to be engaged with in accordance with one's status as a member of a certain community. If an individual lacks the opportunities to engage with others in the relevant domains, her status dignity will be accordingly frustrated.

## 3. Destruction of Dignity

We have seen that dignity can be violated, and that it can be frustrated. In this final section, I consider the ways in which dignity can be destroyed. Dignity is not an inviolable or inalienable feature of persons, on any of the three strands. Rather, dignity is a fragile achievement, and that achievement can be undone. What it means to undo it, how we're harmed when it's undone, and the means by which it can come undone, will naturally differ according to which strand of dignity we are concerned with.

To have personal dignity is to take oneself to be subject to dignitarian norms. To destroy someone's personal dignity, then, is to render her such that she no longer takes herself to be subject to dignitarian norms. In other words, when someone's personal dignity is destroyed, there is nothing she could do or be that she takes to be either debasing or ennobling. Such a person no longer conceives of herself as capable of earning her own pride or disdain.

What kind of treatment might be capable of inflicting such a profound wound on an individual's conception of themselves? We have already encountered one means: torture. As noted above, torture aims to break a person. Sometimes, this extends to breaking down the detainee's conception of herself as a creature bound by normative demands. Elaine Scarry provides perhaps the most perspicuous analysis of the means by which this happens. Pain, she argues, takes us to a place beyond—or prior to—language. We are reduced to mere meat, responding viscerally to the world around us while losing sight of ourselves *as* a self within that world. She writes, "Physical pain does not simply resist language but actively destroys it, bringing about an immediate reversion to a state anterior to language, to the sounds and cries a human being makes before language is learned" (Scarry 1985, 4).

Scarry's argument is given credence by Jean Améry's moving account of his own torture at the hands of German Nazis: "Frail in the face of violence, yelling out in pain, awaiting no help, capable of no resistance, the tortured person is only a body, and nothing else beside that" (Améry 1980, 33); and again, "The tortured person never ceases to be amazed that all those things one may, according to inclination, call his soul, or his mind, or his consciousness, or his identity, are destroyed when there is that cracking and splintering in the shoulder joints" (p. 40). Jacobo Timerman reaffirms these world-destroying effects of torture in his personal memoir *Prisoner Without a Name, Cell Without a Number*:

> The entire world of affection, built up over the years with utmost difficulty, collapses with a kick in the father's genitals, a smack on the mother's face, an obscene insult to the sister, or the sexual violation of a daughter. Suddenly an entire culture based on familial love, devotion, and the capacity for mutual sacrifice collapses. *Nothing is possible in such a universe,* and that is precisely what the torturers know. (Timerman 2002, 69; emphasis added)[^19]

This idea that nothing is possible—that nothing could be fought for, cherished, protected—expresses the kind of nihilistic self-conception symptomatic of having had one's personal dignity destroyed.

There is a second mechanism for destroying personal dignity that it is worth noting, especially given its ubiquity, namely imprisonment. In Lisa Guenther's extraordinary study of the effects of solitary confinement, she unpacks the profound damage done to the prisoner's sense of herself *as* a self when she is isolated from even the possibility of human interaction. While Guenther herself does not discuss this harm in the language of dignity, there are clear connections to be made. Drawing on the empirical studies of Cold War researchers, she notes:

> [T]he prisoner in a Communist POW camp is severely affected by even a few weeks in isolation. He stares into space, gives up spontaneous activity, begins to fiddle with things absentmindedly, ceases to care about personal hygiene, and even soils himself without seeming to notice or care. He mushes his food together and "stuff[s] it into his mouth like an animal." (Guenther 2013, 69)

Guenther also cites Chinese-Irish prisoner Jack Henry Abbott, who spent fourteen to fifteen years in solitary confinement. In his words:

> It is only a matter of time, if you love life too much or fear violence too much, before you become a thing, no longer a man. You can end up scurrying about like a rodent, lending yourself to every conceivable low, evil, degrading act anyone tells you to do—either pigs or prisoners. There is a boundary in each man. . . .But when a man goes beyond the last essential boundary, it *alters his ontology*, so to speak.

(cited in Guenther 2013, 142–3, emphasis added)

This erosion of any sense of oneself as a person with standards to uphold, who is capable of a dignified existence, achieves its culmination in the socalled Mussulman of the Nazi concentration camps. Here's how Améry describes such individuals:

> The so-called Mussulman, as the camp language termed the prisoner who was giving up and was given up by his comrades, no longer had room in his consciousness for the contrasts good or bad, noble or base, intellectual or unintellectual. He was a staggering corpse, a bundle of physical functions in its last convulsions. (Améry 1980, 9)

To destroy someone's personal dignity is to render them a mere shell of the person they once were. They may still be able to act in the world, and perhaps even set goals and achieve them, but something crucial is missing. They have lost access to the kind of meaningful existence that invokes reflexive reactive attitudes. They have lost access to the idea that their own life is something they may be proud or ashamed of.

To say that personal dignity can be destroyed raises the question of whether it can be rebuilt. There is no in principle reason why it can't, but the difficulties in doing so must not be underestimated. As Améry is at pains to stress, "Whoever was tortured, stays tortured. Torture is ineradicably burned into him, even when no clinically objective traces can be detected" (p. 34). George Orwell makes the same point, in his poignant description of Winston in the aftermath of his betrayal of Julia: "'What happens to you here is for ever,' O'Brien had said. That was a true word. There were things, your own acts, from which you could never recover. Something was killed in your breast: burnt out, cauterized out" (Orwell 1961, 256). What both Améry and Orwell are pointing to is not just that the memory of torture remains, resurfacing in the body long after the bones have healed. They are pointing to the psychic scars that change the relationship between the tortured individual and her world. David Sussman captures this aspect of torture well, when he observes:

> Insofar as the victim experiences some part of himself to be in collusion with his tormentor, he confronts not just a loss of control over the way he presents himself to others. Rather, doubt is cast on his ability to have cares and commitments that are more immediately and authentically his own than those of another agent. (Sussman 2005, 29)

Once everything one cares about has been abandoned, every person one loves betrayed—even if just in one's head—then norms can lose their grip as anything other than a mockery of what we might be.

Let's turn now to the destruction of social dignity. To have social dignity, to reiterate, is to be subject to dignitarian norms in virtue of one's membership in a community. To destroy someone's social dignity, then, is to render her such that she is no longer subject to the dignitarian norms of her community. Because we can have social dignity with respect to a range of different communities, social dignity will typically be destroyed locally. That is, an individual will typically cease to have social dignity within one particular community, rather than in all of the communities to which she belongs. That does not mean, though, that the destruction of social dignity is not harmful. As we'll see in more detail in Chapter 3, to no longer have social dignity within a particular community means that others within that community no longer see you as a viable object of respect or contempt for upholding or transgressing shared norms. It thus places you on the outside of a social world of shared meanings.

Destruction of social dignity can be thought of as a kind of excommunication: an expulsion from the shared norms of the community. Those with whom you share physical space no longer see you as sharing a social space, as no longer expected to live up to the standards the community demands of members, and no longer accountable for transgressions. To have one's social dignity destroyed is thus akin to having one's peers take up what Strawson (2008) calls "the objective attitude" towards one. A central kind of human relationship is fractured when individuals are recognized as present, but not held accountable for what they do.

Destruction of social dignity looms whenever people are systematically pathologized, demonized, or infantilized. If someone is deemed incapable of upholding norms, then it is pointless to hold them to those norms. Or if someone is deemed to be "naturally" transgressive, then their transgression doesn't warrant social contempt. Individuals most at risk of having their social dignity destroyed are thus those living in the margins. Homeless people constitute one such group. Those who are homeless—especially those sleeping rough—often lack the resources to meet social dignitarian standards of cleanliness and bodily privacy. Ironically, if those around them respond with contempt, this functions to hold the homeless within the social group; it holds them in social dignity, even while that dignity is being violated. If the broader society ceases to see a homeless person as the right kind of being to be expected to defecate in private (to give just one example) she is placed beneath contempt, and thus has her social dignity destroyed.

A similar pattern is observable with respect to individuals with disabilities—especially those with cognitive impairments. Here's how Geraldo Rivera described the gut-wrenching scene he encountered at Letchworth Village, an institution for individuals with cognitive disabilities, in the early '70s:

> Virtually every patient in building Tau was undressed and there was shit everywhere; it looked and smelled like a poorly kept kennel. . . .The residents of Tau were young girls. . .most of them were literally smeared with feces—their roommates', their own. They looked like children who had been out making mudpies. (cited in Trent Jr. 1994, 258)

At least within the confines of that institution, the social world was presumably such that the girls were not expected to uphold anything like the dignitarian standards of the broader society. This goes beyond violation of social dignity, to become a destruction of their social dignity.

To have one's social dignity destroyed is to be deemed beneath contempt. By contrast, to have one's *status* dignity destroyed is to be removed from a social category, and hence no longer entitled to the forms of recognition respect membership entails. To be stripped of status dignity is thus to be stripped of a very important social power: the power to make recognizable claims on one's fellows.[^20]

While destruction of social dignity and destruction of status dignity often coincide, they are conceptually distinct, and can be teased apart. It is at least conceivable that a community might deem some members to be deviant, and hence beneath contempt, while still perceiving them as rights holders entitled to interpersonal concern. This status may well be fragile—a common pathway to having one's status dignity destroyed is to be removed from the social bonds of shared dignitarian norms—but it is not incoherent. We can also imagine the converse: someone who is held within the community of shared dignitarian norms while being denied the status to make claims as a member.

Like destruction of social dignity, destruction of status dignity is a form of excommunication. One is removed from the web of mutual obligation that binds communities together. Guenther offers a striking example of such excommunication in the prison system, drawing on the memoirs of Jack Henry Abbott. Abbott recalls attempting to initiate an investigation into the suspicious death of a fellow inmate, deemed by the authorities to be a suicide. Abbott's ingenious tactic is to claim that he is entitled to demand an autopsy because the dead inmate owed him money. He thus held that he had a legal and financial interest in determining the cause of death. Abbott's strategy failed, however, because the court ruled that "no prisoner can have obligations of any kind to other prisoners" (cited in Guenther 2013, xxvi). Prisoners lack the kind of status that carries with it entitlement to recognition respect; Abbott himself calls the situation of prisoners a kind of "civil death." The situation of "civil death"—of being physically alive, but outside the laws and norms that would constrain others' treatment of you—is also intrinsic to slavery (cf. Patterson 1982), which is another institution that paradigmatically destroys status dignity. To enslave someone is to remove her from a society in which she had standing to make claims, and place her in a situation of legal non-personhood.[^21]

To close out this chapter on a slightly more positive note, it's worth noting the possibility of resistance against the destruction of dignity. With respect to personal dignity, resistance involves holding fast to the existence of personal dignitarian standards. One of the most poignant fictional examples of such resistance comes from Orwell. The scene takes place after Winston's capture and torture at the hands of O'Brien:

> [O'Brien] paused, and then went on:
> "We have beaten you, Winston. We have broken you up. You have seen what your body is like. Your mind is in the same state. I do not think there can be much pride left in you. You have been kicked and flogged and insulted, you have screamed with pain, you have rolled on the floor in your own blood and vomit. You have whimpered for mercy, you have betrayed everybody and everything. Can you think of a single degradation that has not happened to you?"

Winston had stopped weeping, though the tears were still oozing out of his eyes. He looked up at O'Brien.

"I have not betrayed Julia," he said.

O'Brien looked down at him thoughtfully. "No," he said; "no; that is perfectly true. You have not betrayed Julia." (Orwell 1961, 273)

Of course, much of the poignancy of this scene comes from the reader's knowledge that Winston does, in fact, ultimately betray Julia. At this point in the story, though, Winston is holding on to that last shred of selfrespect—he is reaffirming his personal dignity.

The destruction of social dignity, too, can be resisted. While ultimately an individual's social dignity is in others' hands, in as much as she only has social dignity when others take her to be subject to dignitarian norms, she can nonetheless make demands that others see her as within that normative web. Jean Améry relates the following relevant incident from his time in prison:

> Before me I see the prisoner foreman Juszek, a Polish professional criminal of horrifying vigor. In Auschwitz he once hit me in the face because of a trifle; that is how he was used to dealing with all the Jews under his command. At this moment—I felt it with piercing clarity—it was up to me to go a step further in my prolonged appeals case against society. In open revolt I struck Juszek in the face in turn. My human dignity lay in this punch to his jaw— and that it was in the end I, the physically much weaker man, who succumbed and was woefully thrashed, meant nothing to me. . . . *I became a person* not by subjectively appealing to my abstract humanity but by discovering myself within the given social reality as a rebelling Jew and by realizing myself as one. (Améry 1980, 90, emphasis added)

There are many ways to read this story. What I want to take from it is the way in which Améry draws the ire of the prison guard, precipitating a beating that, because it is now *retaliation*, takes on a different meaning from the random acts of violence that preceded it (cf. Bernstein 2015, 380). Améry has inserted himself into the prison guard's web of social norms by violating them in a way the guard cannot ignore. By provoking the guard's contempt, Améry raises himself from the social death of being *beneath* contempt.

Guenther relates a similar phenomenon within the walls of solitary confinement, whereby prisoners provoke the fury of guards from whom they are otherwise utterly separated by throwing their own feces through the cuffport of their cell. As Guenther explains,

> Not only do they spray officers with their filth, posing both a symbolic and a biomedical threat of contamination by another person's bodily fluids, but they also *make something happen*, initiating a whole series of actions that will ultimately rebound against the prisoners themselves with the violence of retaliation and punishment but that nevertheless exert an ambivalent kind of agency. (Guenther 2013, 188, emphasis in original)

Such acts of rebellion can fruitfully be seen as attempts to reassert one's social dignity in the face of institutional practices which threaten to destroy it.

Status dignity, too, ultimately rests in the hands of others, though once more there are ways in which people resist its destruction. Recall the striking posters from the 1968 Memphis Sanitation strike, boldly declaring "I am a man." Today, the Black Lives Matter movement similarly resonates with the brutal simplicity of its central claim. Protesting in such terms makes explicit what is usually unspoken: that some men are not viewed as men; that some lives are not taken to matter. In making these claims explicit, such protests challenge the observer to both acknowledge and ameliorate the social reality of exclusion; coming to see the protesters as full members of the community and thus reaffirming their status dignity.[^22]

## 4. Wrapping Up

I've covered a lot of ground in this chapter. Drawing a distinction between violations of dignity, frustrations of dignity, and destructions of dignity, I've explored the nature of each of these phenomena, as it manifests across the three strands of personal, social, and status dignity.[^23] This has resulted in a complex mapping of the fragility of dignity, as Table 2.1 summarizes.

**Table 2.1** How dignity can be damaged
|  | Personal Dignity | Social Dignity | Status Dignity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Violated | Be forced to do | Be forced to do | Be treated contrary to |
|  | something | something socially | norms attached to your |
|  | personally debasing | debasing | social status |
| Frustrated | Be prevented from | Be prevented from | Be excluded from spaces in |
|  | doing something | doing something | which you have |
|  | personally | socially ennobling | opportunities to receive |
|  | ennobling |  | respectful treatment |
| Destroyed | Cease to hold | Cease to be held to | Cease to hold a status for |
|  | yourself to | social dignitarian | which norms of respectful |
|  | dignitarian norms | norms | treatment apply |

What I have not attempted to do in this chapter, but what must be directly addressed in the remainder of this book, is explain the moral import of this fragility. Doing so will involve drawing out what has been merely implicit up to this point, namely the precise nature of the harms that attend each point of this map of fragility. This will establish the background necessary for exploring the scope of *dignitarian claims*. In other words, under what conditions are we *wronged* if our dignity is violated, frustrated, or destroyed? Or to put the same point another way: what do we *owe one another* with respect to our dignity? The kinds of examples central to this chapter—torture, public humiliation, negligent medical care, segregation—might suggest the answer to these questions is simple: we must never, under any circumstances, violate, frustrate, or destroy one another's dignity. The moral terrain of dignity is nonetheless difficult to traverse. Dignity, I will argue in the remaining chapters, is not an unalloyed good; nor, importantly, is it something to which we have an unqualified claim. What needs to be done, then, is to determine the precise contours of dignitarian claims.

[^1]: I focus here on cases in which the damage to our dignity is brought about by other agents, since my concern is primarily with what we owe to one another, with respect to our dignity. A fuller investigation of the normative scope of dignity would also consider cases in which dignity is damaged by circumstances beyond any agent's control, for instance if a natural disaster renders someone unable to appear in public fully clothed, or compels her to eat in a way she or her society takes to be debasing; and also with the ways in which we can damage *our own* dignity, by failing to live up to our own and our communities' standards.
[^2]: On the ways in which modern torture differs from earlier forms of torture, see (Wisnewski 2010, 39): "Torture's change is *not* simply a product of the increased desire to hide torture. It is the product of a fundamentally different way of understanding the *victim* of torture: as a subject to be dismantled by the techniques of a science of discipline and control."
[^3]: For more on the connection between torture and feeling debased, see, e.g., (Jacobsen and Montgomery 2007, 286)*.* As they note, "Many torture victims have a *negative self-image,* characterized by shame, feelings of guilt and loss of dignity."
[^4]: For a detailed account of the ways in which the body functions as a site of shame, with a focus on gender, see (Dolezal 2015).
[^5]: That our self-assessment can come apart from our reflective judgment is a central part of Robin Dillon's (1997) argument for the possibility and import of what she calls "basal self-respect."
[^6]: In Chapter 3 I'll restrict the term "humiliation" to attempts to violate someone's *social* dignity. Both Margalit and Statman are using the term more loosely here, to cover both what I would call personal dignity violations and social dignity violations.
[^7]: For first-person accounts of such systems of humiliation, see (*The Guardian Australia* 2019).
[^8]: Lack of sanitary items is also a problem in prisons in the US, where women are routinely denied adequate supplies. As Chandra Bozelko (2015) observes, "Stains on clothes seep into self-esteem and serve as an indelible reminder of one's powerlessness in prison."
[^9]: As with personal dignity, our social dignity can also be violated through neglect. That is, responsible others can fail to provide us with the means to uphold our own social dignity. Homelessness provides a useful example here. Consider the following appeal from the appropriately named Australian charity "Share the Dignity": "When you donate sanitary products to Share the Dignity, you're donating much more than pads and tampons. You're giving a woman experiencing homelessness or financial crisis the essentials, so she doesn't need to choose between food and dignity." (Sharethedignity.com.au). To be denied the means to appear in public in unsoiled clothes is to have one's social dignity violated.
[^10]: This is not to say that these relationships were always necessarily consensual, which they may well not have been. My focus, though, is on what the *French* people are doing to these women, and how the public parading of their purported sins constitutes its own social dignity violation, independently of whatever dignity violations may have occurred within the women's interactions with the German soldiers.
[^11]: Of course, the *perpetrator* has transgressed (what we can at least hope are) social dignitarian norms. I'm concerned here, though, with the social dignity of the victim.
[^12]: Cf. Bonnie Mann's (2018) distinction between what she calls "ubiquitous shame" and "unbounded shame," both of which she also sees as endured by women. It is worth noting that sexuality can also be a source of such perpetual shame: see, e.g., (Moon and Tobin 2018).
[^13]: This is just to say that status dignity is what John Rawls (1999) has called a "range property."
[^14]: Jay Bernstein (2015, 100–15) goes further, claiming that it is built into the very notion of a community that some kind of response to the pain or distress of others is called for. I suspect he's right, but I won't press the point here.
[^15]: I'll say more about the connection between status dignity and membership in social groups in Chapter 4; for now, I just note that citizenship is an easy case because membership is determined by explicit laws, rather than social norms.
[^16]: For an excellent discussion of the ways in which treating cognitively disabled adults as children violates their dignity, see (Barclay 2018).
[^17]: Michael Rosen at one point puts a similar idea in terms of dignity violation: "One of the key ways in which human dignity is violated," he writes, "is by preventing human beings from behaving in ways that are dignified" (Rosen 2012, 159).
[^18]: The HBO television series *Treme* offers a fictional example of this: a Big Chief has his arraignment delayed in order to keep him imprisoned over Mardi Gras, in retaliation for having assaulted a police officer. The context of the show makes clear that this is a deliberate attempt to deprive the Chief of an important social good—as the Chief 's son remarks, "Keep a Big Chief locked up on Mardi Gras, that's a message."
[^19]: The kind of loss Scarry, Améry, and Timerman describe could also be understood more broadly as destruction of *agency*. It is precisely the destruction of agency that both Sussman (2005) and Wisnewski (2010) identify as the core harm of torture. I don't deny that torture destroys agency, but my concern here is narrower. Torture, I claim, destroys its target's identity as a self-regarding creature, which may or may not coincide with loss of broader agential capacities.
[^20]: Cf. Joel Feinberg: "what is called 'human dignity' may simply be the recognizable capacity to assert claims" (1970, 252).
[^21]: Cf. Giorgio Agamben's (1998) notion of "bare life."
[^22]: A more ambivalent example of reclaiming status dignity is provided by Hannah Arendt. Describing the civic death of stateless persons, Arendt notes that they are ironically in a better legal situation if they commit a crime:<blockquote> The best criterion by which to decide whether someone has been forced outside the pale of the law is to ask if he would benefit by committing a crime. . . .As a criminal even a stateless person will not be treated worse than another criminal, that is, he will be treated like everybody else. Only as an offender against the law can he gain protection from it. (Arendt 1951, 286)</blockquote> Recalling Améry's desperate provocation of anger to reinstate his entry into the realm of reactive attitudes in order to shore up his social dignity, the stateless person in Arendt's telling desperately tries to reinstate his entry into the realm of laws in order to shore up his status dignity.
[^23]: There is one more way in which dignity is fragile that I have not discussed here, since it is peripheral to my concerns—but it is worth at least noting. What can be destroyed in full can be destroyed in part, and so *erosions* of dignity would refer to situations in which someone's personal, social, or status dignity has been partially destroyed. For personal dignity, this would involve a reduction in the range or strengths of dignitarian norms to which they hold themselves; for social dignity this would involve a reduction in the range or strength of dignitarian norms to which their community holds them; and for status dignity this would involve a reduction in the range or forms of recognition respect that applied to them. The ways in which this might occur, and the harms that result from it, can be inferred from the analysis of dignity destruction.
