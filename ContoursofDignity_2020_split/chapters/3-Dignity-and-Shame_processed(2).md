# 3. Dignity and Shame

## 1. Introduction

In Chapter 2 I explored the various ways in which dignity could be violated, frustrated, or destroyed. Since dignity comes in personal, social, and status strands, this resulted in quite a complex mapping of the fragility of dignity, as we saw in Table 2.1. The question to be addressed in the remaining chapters is whether—or more precisely, under what conditions—we have a moral claim to the protection of our dignity.

There won't be space here to provide an exhaustive accounting of the precise conditions under which agents are entitled to the protection of their dignity, taking into account each of the nine permutations from the table (nor, I'm assuming, would any reader be inclined to wade through such an accounting!). Rather, my goal in the remaining chapters is to lay the necessary groundwork for such an accounting to take place. The goal, then, is not to provide a metric into which any example of a dignitarian harm could be plugged, so that we could then read off the presence or absence of a valid dignitarian claim. Rather, my goal is more modest: to start to get a little bit clearer on how each of the three strands of dignity ought to figure in our moral reasoning. In this chapter I focus on personal and social dignity. These two strands travel together, insofar as both are intimately connected to *appraisal respect*, and hence with experiences of shame and humiliation: as Silvan Tomkins (1995, 133) notes, "Shame is the affect of indignity." The challenge in this chapter is thus, in large part, to explore the moral import of shame.[^1] Status dignity will be treated separately in Chapter 4, since it raises distinctive normative questions concerning the grounds of recognition respect, and the nature of social kinds. Chapter 5 will complete the discussion with an examination of a central instance of status dignity, namely *human* dignity.

Even the most powerful amongst us can object to their dignity being violated, often on the basis of merely verbal critique. Recall the outrage expressed by North Korea's national newspaper when Trump insulted Kim Jong-Un: "The worst crime for which [Trump] can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership" (cited in France-Presse 2017). But do we actually wrong Kim Jong-Un if we ridicule him? More generally, do others *necessarily* wrong us if they force us to do something personally debasing? Or if they prevent us from doing something socially ennobling? The answers to these questions are not obvious. In addressing them, we need first to closely examine the interests at stake in each strand of dignity, and then ask the further question of whether others are obligated to protect or promote those interests. This analysis leans on a distinction between being harmed and being wronged, where the former refers simply to having one's interests set back, and the latter brings in a normative component of at least *pro tanto* moral impermissibility.

Before embarking on that task, two brief comments on the import of what's happening in the remainder of the book are important. First, one of my core hopes with this book it to motivate the reader to take a more expansive view of the concept of dignity, recognizing it as so much more than either an "inner kernel" grounding moral worth, or a social status conferred upon us. For my theory to be a contender, though, it's important that it have something to say about the relationship between dignity and *rights*, since this relationship features prominently in so many conceptions of dignity. On the "inner kernel" view, the relationship between dignity and rights is straightforward: since dignity grounds our moral status, we have rights because we have dignity. Or to put it another way, part of the respect we are owed as creatures with dignity is respect for our moral rights. The social status conception of dignity is similarly straightforward, though inverted. On this view, dignity is conferred upon us through the attribution of moral and legal rights. In other words, we have dignity because we have rights (cf. Feinberg 1970). On my view, the relationship between dignity and rights is much more complex. There is no simple sense in which we have rights because we have dignity. Conversely, on my view, it is misleading to say that we only have dignity insofar as we are accorded rights. Admittedly, some central instances of status dignity *are* primarily constituted by the attribution of rights (the status dignity attaching to citizenship is an example of this: one's status as a citizen is largely constituted by rights and responsibilities, which includes restrictions on how one can be treated, especially by the state). However, the attribution of rights is certainly not how personal or social dignity are constituted. For these strands, it is the possession of dignity that grounds (at least some) rights claims. More precisely, the fact that we hold ourselves to certain standards, or are held to certain standards by our communities, means we have interests that are *prima facie* sufficient to hold others to have particular obligations towards us (cf. Raz 1986, 166).

While the complexity of my theory's relationship to rights may seem like a drawback, I urge the reader to have patience. What's lacking in simplicity is, I believe, more than made up for by the fecundity of the theory. Unlike standard conceptions, my theory of dignity draws our attention to the day-today demands we make on one another for respect, and provides some tools to assess the viability of those demands.

The second preliminary comment is this: exploring the scope of moral claims against having one's personal, social, and status dignity damaged helps show why the theory is important, even for those who deny that what's being described here ought to be understood under the banner of "dignity." In other words, even those who remain firmly committed to their own conceptions of dignity ought to be able to recognize that the phenomena described in Chapter 2 are morally significant and warrant further philosophical investigation. While I prefer to undertake that investigation using the language of dignity, using different language would not undermine the central claims I will be going on to make in the remaining chapters.

## 2. Claims to Personal Dignity

To understand the scope of our moral claims to personal dignity, we need to first get clear on the interests at stake. The primary interest individuals have in protecting their personal dignity is to protect their *self-respect*. Whether we're talking about violation, frustration, or destruction of personal dignity, the threat to the individual is primarily a threat to her conception of herself as a person of worth. The dependence of self-respect on protection of personal dignity is built into the very concept: since personal dignity consists in holding oneself to norms and standards it is ennobling to uphold and/or debasing to transgress, where to be ennobling or debasing is understood in terms of how highly or poorly the agent would think of herself, personal dignity and self-respect travel together.

### 2.1 Violations of Personal Dignity

To better unpack this relationship between personal dignity and self-respect, and to begin to get a grip on the scope of personal dignity claims, it will be useful to start by focusing on the category of personal dignity *violations*. As we've seen in Chapter 2, someone's personal dignity is violated if she is compelled to transgress a dignitarian norm, thus doing or being something that she finds debasing or disgraceful. Personal dignity violations can set back the agent's interest in self-respect via two distinct mechanisms, which track the two ways of cashing out what it means to hold oneself to a norm. On the one hand, if an agent has a *disposition* to think less of herself for doing or being *x*, then being made to do or be *x* will cause (or at least threaten) immediate psychological harms: personal dignity violations are likely to lead to the agent thinking less of herself. On the other hand, if an agent *reflectively endorses* the claim that she ought to think less of herself for doing or being *x*, then being made to do or be *x* constitutes a harm to her integrity: personal dignity violations of this sort turn the agent into the kind of person she takes not to warrant self-respect. I'll treat each of these in turn.

The psychological harms of personal dignity violations are deeply entwined with the emotion of *shame*. Or more cautiously, since there is no consensus on what shame is, I should say that there is a way in which the emotion of shame can be understood which illuminates the psychological harms of personal dignity violations. Consider Gabrielle Taylor's (1985) account of the emotion of shame: "Whenever a person experiences shame," she writes, "then he experiences an injury to his self-respect" (p. 80). This is because, according to Taylor, "The person concerned believes of herself that she has deviated from some norm and in doing so she has altered her standing in the world" (p. 1). Deonna and Teroni (2009, 35) make a similar point: "in shame," they write, "a given trait or behavior is evaluated as *degrading*, or as revealing one's *lack of worth*." In a related vein, but drawing on the Confucian tradition, Justin Tiwald notes that "[w]hen one feels ashamed in the relevant respect, it's similar in some ways to feeling contaminated or impure." Where I depart from at least some of these authors is in allowing the relevant belief to be merely implicit. The kind of shame that typically accompanies violations of personal dignity can thus be better framed in terms of the person concerned *perceiving herself* as having deviated some norm, and thereby *perceiving herself* as having a lowered standing in the world.[^2]

It is important to note that not all accounts of shame fit with this description. In particular, those accounts which construe shame as a fundamentally social emotion will have little time for this deeply subjective way of construing the emotion. My goal is not to adjudicate the ongoing debate about the best way to construe the emotion of shame. Rather, I hope simply to identify a particular phenomenon an agent can experience—the feeling that attaches to perceiving herself as lesser. I'll henceforth call this phenomenon "personal shame," both to differentiate it from the "social shame" I'll be discussing below, and to signal its connection to personal dignity. Personal shame, then, is what we feel when we "see ourselves" as lesser.

We can tease apart two distinct ways in which individuals are harmed when they are induced to feel personal shame. First, and most obviously, personal shame is a deeply unpleasant emotion to experience: the feeling of being unable to look oneself in the eye, or of cringing from the memory of what one has done, is one that most of us typically try to avoid. As Luna Dolezal notes, even physical pain is sometimes preferable to the pain of shame: "Physical pain or discomfort is easily forgotten while the pain of shame, especially body shame, burns brightest in our memories ready to be relived at any moment, months, years or even decades after its occurrence" (Dolezal 2015, 46). An individual's interest in avoiding personal dignity violations can thus be understood simply as an interest in avoiding psychological pain.

The psychological pain of shame can further harm individuals, though, in virtue of its effects on *agency*. Consider John Rawls's (1999) justification for positing self-respect as a primary good. Without self-respect, he says, "nothing may seem worth doing, or if some things have value for us, we lack the will to strive for them. All desire and activity becomes empty and vain, and we sink into apathy and cynicism" (p. 386).[^3] To lose self-respect, on Rawls's view, is to lose a crucial condition for agency. When we think less of ourselves it can be harder to find the motivation to do the things we care about; harder to overcome the "slings and arrows of outrageous fortune"; harder to find the courage to take risks, or try new things. More immediately, shame can render it next to impossible to act in the moment. As Gershen Kaufman has argued, "The binding effects of exposure, of feeling seen, acutely disturb the smooth functioning of the self [...]. Exposure can interrupt movement, bind speech and make eye contact intolerable. *Shame paralyzes the self* " (cited in Dolezal 2015, 44, emphasis added). The lower the estimation in which we hold ourselves, the higher the barriers to acting effectively in the world. In sum, then, personal dignity violations can harm us through inducing (or threatening to induce) feelings of personal shame, which is both an immediate psychological harm, and also a downstream harm to our effective agency.

What, though, of personal dignity violations that are *not* accompanied by feelings of personal shame? My theory allows that someone's personal dignity might be violated even if they are unaware of the fact. How might such violations harm their victims, given that by stipulation they are not accompanied by psychological harms? Such violations, I claim, can harm their victims' *integrity*.[^4] When we reflectively endorse our dignitarian norms, we are establishing for ourselves the terms of our own self-respect, laying out the contours of what we take ourselves to be required to do or be in order to be entitled to a high estimation of ourselves. When we are forced to transgress those norms, we are forced to do or be something we are opposed to—we are forced to betray ourselves. Such betrayal is a harm to the agent, even if she is unaware of it: it sets back her interest in being the person she believes she needs to be, in order to be worthy of her own respect.[^5]

There are thus three interrelated interests at stake in avoiding personal dignity violations: the interest in avoiding the psychological pain of personal shame; the interest in protecting effective agency; and the interest in integrity. These interests—whether separately or jointly—will often suffice to ground a moral claim that others not violate our personal dignity.

To take an easy case in which such a claim is successful, consider the Bullied Student.

**The Bullied Student:** Serena has the following dignitarian norm: it is debasing to drink from a toilet bowl. Unfortunately, Serena has caught the eye of a group of schoolyard bullies. Sensing that Serena might hold herself to such a norm, they torment her by forcing her to drink from a toilet bowl.

Clearly, Serena has a moral claim that the bullies not force her to do such a thing. Sufficient grounds for this claim lie in the three interests identified above: her interest in avoiding the psychological pain of personal shame; her interest in protecting her effective agency; and her interest in integrity.

While these three interests suffice to ground Serena's claim against the bullies, it does not follow that we always have a valid moral claim against others violating our personal dignity. Consider the case of the Entitled Misogynist.

**The Entitled Misogynist:** Barry has been brought up to believe that men can expect to receive the attention and affection of women, and that the inability of a man to secure this attention and affection makes him contemptuous. Barry thus has the following personal dignitarian norm: it is debasing to be denied the attention and affection of any woman from whom it is sought. On his morning commute Barry's eye is caught by Bonnie, sitting on her own reading a book. He approaches her, and expresses his interest in receiving her affection. Bonnie ignores his advances, and continues to read her book. Barry then experiences a deep feeling of personal shame.[^6]

On the account of personal dignity violations I gave in Chapter 2, Bonnie violates Barry's personal dignity: through ignoring his advances, she causes him to do or be something he takes to be debasing, i.e. a rejected man. Nonetheless, I hope we can all agree that Barry has no claim to Bonnie's attention or affection. She does him no wrong in ignoring his advances. To explain why this is the case, we need to examine some of the factors at play in the case of the Entitled Misogynist, and how they undermine Barry's standing to make dignitarian claims on Bonnie. Before doing that, though, two objections to this way of framing the situation need to be considered.

The strongest objection to the way I've presented the Entitled Misogynist case simply denies that Barry's dignity is in any way violated. This objection may, in fact, seem like a *reductio* of the theoretical framework I've thus far developed: if I have to say that *this* is a personal dignity violation, surely something has gone badly awry? I feel the force of this objection. It certainly goes against common usage to construe what happens to Barry as a dignity violation. One way to avoid this implication, without radically reworking the theoretical framework, would be to restrict the term "dignity violation" to cases in which someone is *wronged* by being made to transgress a dignitarian norm. Since Barry is not wronged by Bonnie, it would follow that she does not violate his dignity. While this move may well result in a more superficially palatable criterion for labeling something a dignity violation, it's important to note that it does not actually resolve any of the relevant moral questions—all it does is push them back a step. We would still need to know what it is about the Entitled Misogynist case that explains why Barry is not wronged, and hence we would still need to determine the scope of his dignitarian claims. Whether we restrict the term "dignity violation" for cases in which the agent is wronged or instead stick with a broader application of that term, the critical work still lies in establishing the conditions under which we're entitled to make claims on others to refrain from forcing us do or be something we find debasing. *That* is the question I'm seeking to answer here, and it's independent of how we apply the terminology of dignity violation. I choose to continue employing the terminology more broadly, not because I think the narrower usage would be conceptually confused, but for more strategic reasons: I suspect that deploying the narrower usage would be more likely to lead to the central moral questions being side-stepped. Using the broader terminology avoids the ever-present temptation to beg the question of when forcing someone to transgress a personal dignitarian norm is a moral wrong.

A second objection to the way I've framed the case of the Entitled Misogynist concerns my claim that Bonnie *does not wrong* Barry. An alternative way to construe the situation would be to say that Bonnie *does* wrong Barry, but that she is justified in doing so. Admittedly, the case of the Entitled Misogynist may not be the best way to motivate this objection. Consider, though, a modified version of the Bullied Student case. This time, the bullies set their minds to making Serena's friend, Carlos, be the one to make her drink from the toilet bowl. They do this by threatening to perform a far more serious wrong if he refuses. (Feel free to fill in the details of their threat such that you're confident the right thing for Carlos to do is force Serena to drink from the toilet bowl.) In this case, it seems much clearer that Carlos wrongs Serena, though justifiably so. The fact that Serena is wronged is evidenced by the fact that there is a moral residue here—at the very least, Carlos owes Serena an apology, if not some kind of compensation.[^7] This is not the case for the Entitled Misogynist: though we can stipulate that Barry is *harmed*, in virtue of the psychological discomfort of feeling shame, he is not *wronged*. Bonnie owes him nothing for having rebuffed his advances. In considering the scope of dignitarian claims, then, it will be important to tease apart two distinct ways in which such claims can fall short: first, an agent may lack *any* claim against having her personal dignity violated. To violate her dignity, in such a case, is to do her no wrong at all. Second, an agent may lack *sufficient* claim against having her personal dignity violated. To violate her dignity, in such a case, would be to commit a justifiable wrong. At the very least, such violations of dignity ought to be accompanied by regret.

With these considerations in mind, let's get stuck into the moral weeds. The first thing we can say about dignitarian claims, I think, is that we all have a valid moral claim that others not *gratuitously* violate our personal dignity. This follows from a more general principle that we ought not gratuitously harm one another. Since the psychological pain of shame, the frustration of agency that typically accompanies shame, and loss of integrity, all constitute harms, we ought not gratuitously bring them about.

Note, though that the gratuitous clause is doing a lot of work here. Obviously, we ought not harm one another in the absence of any countervailing reasons. Such a duty is manifestly justifiable. Things get a lot murkier, though, once countervailing reasons are brought into the picture, as we saw with the modified Bullied Student case. Perhaps, then, we can say the following: we have a general moral claim that others only violate our dignity when doing so is necessary to avoid greater harms, and that they compensate us for any harms they thereby bring about (where apology can often function as sufficient compensation). This is surely a claim that Serena has against Carlos.

This still doesn't get things right, though, because it would entail that Bonnie owes Barry an apology for rebuffing his advances. What's needed is an explanation for why, in some cases, the fact that an action will bring about harm fails to constitute a moral reason not to perform it. More modestly, we need an explanation for why, in the context of the Entitled Misogynist, the fact that her rebuff will violate Barry's dignity gives Bonnie no moral reason not to rebuff him.[^8] In other words: when are someone's dignitarian norms such that they fail to generate moral claims on others?

There might be a temptation here to appeal to some kind of objective truth: we only have reason to protect someone's personal dignity, we might say, if they hold themselves to *correct* dignitarian norms. If someone takes it to be debasing to do something that is manifestly *not* debasing, why should we be morally required to pander to their misguided notions? This temptation ought to be avoided. The validity of personal dignity claims cannot depend upon the correctness of the norms individuals hold themselves to. Consider Serena's situation: would we really want to say that the bullies only wrong Serena if she *ought* to feel debased for drinking from a toilet bowl? Or to make a more politically salient example: do we really want to say that states only wrong their Muslim citizens by forcing them to remove headscarves in public if those citizens are *correct* that it's debasing to appear in public without a headscarf? Or that the sexual humiliation suffered by the detainees in Abu Ghraib only wronged them if they were *correct* to see it as debasing to wear women's underwear? Since there's much to be said for the claim that very little that's done to us against our will *ought* to result in us thinking less of ourselves, such an approach would give us license to run roughshod over people's dignitarian standards.

A better alternative, I suggest, is to shift attention from the justifiability of the agent's dignitarian norm, per se, to consider the justifiability of the obligations that norm would impose on others. (Here we can appeal to Joseph Raz's (1986) conceptualization of rights in terms of interests of sufficient strength to justify the imposition of duties on others.[^9]) So the question for the Bullied Student case is not whether Serena is justified in taking it to be debasing to drink from the toilet bowl, but rather whether it is justifiable to hold the bullies to be obligated not to force their fellow students to drink from toilet bowls. Likewise, the question for the Entitled Misogynist case is not whether Barry is justified in taking it to be debasing to have his advances rejected, but rather whether it is justifiable to take women whose attention he solicits to be under an obligation to provide that attention. Put in these terms, the relevant difference between the two cases is clear: it is not about whose dignitarian norms are correct, and nor is it about who is more harmed by being compelled to transgress their dignitarian norm. Rather, it is about the nature of the obligations the respective dignitarian claims presuppose.

There are a range of reasons for which a purported obligation may be unjustifiable: it might conflict with the duty-bearer's rights; it might clash with another of the duty-bearer's obligations; it might be overly onerous; or it might be undermined by its own grounds, to name but a few. The Entitled Misogynist provides an example of the first kind of reason. Bonnie cannot be obligated not to violate Barry's dignity in this situation, because this conflicts with her right to sexual autonomy. Or consider a case in which someone holds a dignitarian norm that others be subservient to them—that is, such a person takes it to be deeply debasing for others to refuse to acknowledge her superiority. Others cannot be obligated not to violate such a person's personal dignity, insofar as doing so conflicts with *their* personal dignity standards. We cannot seek to protect ourselves from debasement by requiring that others debase themselves—the purported obligation is undermined by its own grounds. The same may well be true in the Entitled Misogynist case: assuming there is something debasing about taking strangers' claims to our affection as authoritative, Barry's claim on Bonnie is likewise self-undermining.

I have argued that we only have a moral claim not to have our dignity violated insofar as the obligations corresponding to such a claim are justifiable. To see further how this would work in practice, let's focus in on the domain of healthcare. This is a domain in which personal dignity is particularly vulnerable to violation, and in which practitioners have a strong interest in establishing the boundaries of patients' claims upon them. We can start with an example we've already seen in Chapter 2: the cancer patient whose bedclothes were stripped back by the doctor, exposing her to a crowd of medical students. To determine whether or not the patient had a justifiable claim that the doctor not violate her dignity in this way, we need to consider what kinds of corresponding obligations such a claim would presuppose. Assuming the doctor's disregard for the patient's state of undress is not necessary for him to fulfill his duties to train the medical students, it is hard to see how the patient's claim could be denied. Taking a moment to explain procedures to patients, and to allow them to mentally prepare for their exposure, is not especially onerous. Nor is it plausible to suppose doctors have some kind of standing right to treat their patients in any way they like. This seems like a clear case in which the patient has a moral claim not to have her personal dignity violated. It does not follow, however, that *all* patients' claims against having their personal dignity violated are justifiable; and this is so even if we remain within the realm of bodily privacy. For instance, if a patient insisted on being treated while having no part of her body seen by any attending medical practitioner, this would presumably conflict with the medical practitioners' obligation to provide effective treatment.

Healthcare professionals may also find themselves in situations that are closer to the case of the Entitled Misogynist. Consider a patient who would find it debasing to be treated by a female doctor, or a doctor of color: does the hospital have an obligation to find the patient a doctor who satisfies his prejudices, in order to protect his dignity? One relevant factor in assessing such a situation is how debasing the rejected doctor would find it to be removed from the situation. This is likely to be influenced by broader societal factors: if the workplace is otherwise deeply egalitarian, and the doctor feels fully supported in her identity, such a one-off request may not be a violation of her dignity. If this is one of many such requests, however, or if such a request reinforces structural injustices she faces in her day-to-day life, it will be less likely that the patient's claim to have his dignity protected will be justified, since doing so can only come at the cost of the *doctor's* dignity.

Another relevant factor here is the vulnerability of the patient.[^10] Vulnerability has the potential to both magnify the harms of dignity violations (when we're vulnerable even minor slights can deal a harsh blow to our self-worth), and to up the ante for blocking such claims through appeals to the onerousness of the corresponding obligations (when vulnerable people are brought into our care in virtue of our professional role, there is a reasonable expectation that we bear more of any burdens to be distributed between us (Goodin 1986)). The key implication of vulnerability is that claims against having one's dignity violated that may not be justified outside a healthcare setting may well be justified within it: the bar for a claim to be justifiable is lowered.

Vulnerability is relevant to claims against having one's dignity violated in a further sense, too. As we saw in Chapter 2, one way in which dignity can be violated is if those on whom we depend fail to assist us in avoiding doing or being that which we take to be debasing. This is a particularly salient form of dignity violation within healthcare settings, where we are often unable to perform basic bodily functions unassisted. As with all other forms of dignity violation, though, it cannot be taken as given that we automatically have a valid claim that others assist us in avoiding doing or being that which we take to be debasing. Again, it depends on the justifiability of the obligation such a claim would presuppose. That said, most of the standard complaints patients have about the dignity-violating forms of neglect they experience in healthcare provision seem eminently justifiable. Obligations on healthcare providers to ensure patients are able to restrict who sees their naked bodies, or can maintain some degree of privacy in toileting, or are provided with assistance in making themselves presentable for visitors, are neither onerous nor in conflict with other duties.[^11]

### 2.2 Frustration and Destruction of Personal Dignity

Much more could be said about when and why we are justified in demanding that others not violate our personal dignity. Hopefully, though, enough has been said already to show how that discussion ought to proceed. I'll thus turn now to consider the other ways in which personal dignity is fragile, and what kinds of claims we might be able to make in those regards. I'll first consider *frustrations* of personal dignity, before looking at *destruction* of personal dignity. Since the groundwork for this discussion has already been laid, I'll move much more quickly through these categories.

It is straightforward to see how frustrations of personal dignity harm their targets: being able to take pride in who one is, and what one does, is immensely valuable, providing a solid bedrock of self-respect. As such, being blocked from taking pride in who one is or what one does is a potentially significant setback to an individual's interests.

That said, the extent to which an individual is harmed by having her personal dignity frustrated will very much depend on the circumstances. If an individual has multiple avenues available by which she can do or be something ennobling, blocking any one of them would do her very little harm. (It would admittedly be callous, at least if done without good reason, but it would not substantially affect her self-respect.) If an individual has very few avenues through which she can ennoble herself, though, and especially if her sense of self-worth is already fragile, the effects of frustrating her personal dignity are potentially profound. Particular care must thus be taken to preserve space in which those with limited resources for boosting their selfrespect can perform those acts they find ennobling, especially if doing so does not generate onerous or otherwise problematic obligations on others.

We have already encountered one case of what I take to be a justifiable claim against having one's personal dignity frustrated in Chapter 2, with the example of the Guantanamo Bay prisoners whose artwork was destroyed rather than displayed. Since so few avenues exist within contexts of detainment for individuals to take pride in themselves, it is especially important to preserve what avenues remain. Those in charge of detention centers and prisons, then, plausibly have an obligation not to use the removal of even seemingly trivial means of self-expression as a form of punishment. For instance, removing a prisoner's personal comb for a minor infraction may well remove one of the only means the prisoner has to take pride in her own appearance, which may in turn be one of the few avenues available to her to boost her sense of self-worth. As such, prisoners can be said to have at least a *prima facie* claim not to have their dignity frustrated, especially where this involves prison officers simply refraining from foreclosing avenues of selfexpression by which prisoners may be able to do or be something they take to be ennobling.

Not all pathways to personal ennoblement impose obligations that are justifiable, though, and as such we do not always have a moral claim against our personal dignity being frustrated. For instance, an individual may take it to be personally ennobling to violently enforce social hierarchies—he may hold himself in higher regard, that is, insofar as he is able to beat others into submission. Consider the implications of this within a prison facility: this may well be the *only* avenue available to a prisoner to enhance his self-worth. Nonetheless, he cannot have a moral claim that others not prevent him from acting in such a way. Here we have a purported claim that is both selfundermining, since one person's avenues for self-worth cannot be protected at the cost of others', *and* with the purported duty-bearers' prior obligations, since the prison guards have an obligation to protect the physical security of all inmates. As with moral claims against having one's personal dignity violated, then, claims against having one's personal dignity frustrated are contextspecific, and depends on the justifiability of the corresponding duties.

Let's turn now to destruction of personal dignity. To destroy an individual's personal dignity is to render her such that she no longer holds herself to dignitarian norms. Richard Rorty's analysis of torture as the ultimate cruelty, through the lens of Winston's torture in Orwell's novel 1984, brings out the possibility and import of personal dignity destruction very clearly. As he puts it:

> [P]eople can, their torturers hope, experience the ultimate humiliation of saying to themselves, in retrospect, "Now that I have believed or desired *this*, I can never be what I hoped to be, what I thought I was. The story I have been telling myself about myself—my picture of myself as honest, or loyal, or devout—no longer makes sense. *I no longer have a self to make sense of*. " (Rorty 1989, 179, emphasis added)

To destroy someone's personal dignity is to do her an egregious harm, constituting an obliteration of the very conceivability of self-regard. This goes well beyond the kind of reduction of self-respect we've considered so far in the context of personal dignity violations or frustrations.

I claimed in Chapter 2 that destruction of personal dignity is a particularly egregious harm because it means the individual can no longer make sense of her life as something that she may be either proud or ashamed of. This kind of loss is deeply enervating: we use the prospect of pride or shame to set goals and motivate ourselves to achieve them. The grounds of a moral claim against having one's personal dignity destroyed is this: we have an interest in maintaining the kind of psychological profile that enables us to be effective agents.

The plausibility of this moral claim is strengthened by the ease of the duty it imposes. It is *difficult* to destroy someone's dignity, requiring extensive and repeated trauma, such as is imposed through repeated torture or extended solitary confinement. At the risk of stating the bleeding obvious: refraining from such destruction imposes little burden on others. Moreover, the kinds of practices most likely to destroy personal dignity—such as torture or extended solitary confinement—are not ones we ever plausibly have a duty to perform.[^12] Unlike for personal dignity violations or frustrations, then, the claim against having one's dignity *destroyed* is not context-sensitive: we always have a justifiable claim that others not destroy our personal dignity.[^13]

## 3. Claims to Social Dignity

Let's turn now to social dignity. Again, it will be helpful to begin with claims against social dignity *violations*, before extending the analysis to frustration and destruction of social dignity. As with personal dignity violations, we first need to identify the interests at stake, before considering the scope of our social dignitarian claims.

### 3.1 Violations of Social Dignity

To have one's social dignity violated is to be presented as having transgressed a social dignitarian norm, thereby having one's community invited to view one with lowered appraisal respect. Two types of interest loom large for social dignity violations: on the one hand, social dignity violations typically cause a reduction in *social standing*; on the other hand, social dignity violations threaten a *psychological harm*.

When someone's social dignity is violated, they are being presented as publicly transgressing social dignitarian norms, and hence as unworthy of the esteem of their peers. They are made to do or be such that those in their community see them as lesser, or perhaps even as contemptible. This will typically result in the targeted individual having a lowered standing within that group.[^14] Talk of social standing presupposes social hierarchy, and more precisely an uneven distribution of social *power*. To have standing within a group is to be in a position to have one's interests and opinions heard and taken into consideration—to be seen as someone who *matters* in the life of the group, and hence be able to influence that life. Presenting someone as contemptible is a means of reducing their standing, and hence reducing their social power. Insofar as we have an interest in maintaining a decent level of social standing in the communities to which we belong, social dignity violations are straightforwardly harms. Importantly, though, this harm does not depend on the agent's subjective awareness of her loss of social standing. That loss is a social fact, independent of her attitude towards it. This means that even those who are not cognizant of the dignity violation are harmed by it.

When individuals *are* aware of the social dignity violation, though, a psychological harm typically comes into effect. In such situations, victims of social dignity violations experience shame in a very different way from that identified by Taylor, discussed above. Rather than feeling that we have failed to uphold *our own* standards, this experience of shame involves the realization that we have failed to uphold *social* standards.[^15] This way of thinking about shame aligns with that defended by Heidi Maibom (2010). According to Maibom, shame is a fundamentally social emotion, which involves "failing to live up to public norms, standards, and ideals" (p. 589). This accords with the accounts of shame given by Sandra Bartky (1990), who defines shame as the "distressed apprehension of oneself as lesser"; by Moon and Tobin, who write "Shame is a painful emotion in which a person feels exposed to others as defective and fears rejection from the community on the basis of that exposure" (Moon and Tobin 2018, 1); and also with that given by Gerhart Piers and Milton Singer, "Behind the fear of shame stands not the fear of hatred but the fear of contempt which. . .spells fear of abandonment. . .death by emotional starvation" (cited in Probyn 2005, 3). I call the phenomenon being described here *social shame*, to differentiate it from the personal shame discussed above.[^16]

Just as for personal shame, the feeling of social shame typically induced by social dignity violations also harms individuals *indirectly*, through damage to their effective agency. The realization that we have lost the grounds for others' respect can be deeply distressing, leading to a desire to hide oneself away, shrinking from the public gaze. As Maibom (2010) points out, the phenomenology of shame involves "[f]eeling small, feeling inferior to others, and wanting to sink into the ground" (p. 586). Such desires hamper our ability to effectively act in the world.[^17] Likewise, Erving Goffman (1967) has argued that shame (or in his terms, embarrassment) stunts our capacity to act in the world:

> a completely flustered individual is one who cannot for the time being mobilize his muscular and intellectual resources for the task at hand, although he would like to; he cannot volunteer a response to those around him that will allow them to sustain the conversation smoothly. He and his flustered actions block the line of activity the others have been pursuing. He is present with them, but he is not "in play" (p.100).

So there are three core interests that are typically set back when an agent's social dignity is violated: her social standing; the avoidance of psychological pain; and effective agency. It is important to note that these harms do not depend on the agent actually having transgressed the relevant norms. For the psychological harm, and its corresponding harm to agency, it suffices that the individual *believes* that a social dignitarian norm was transgressed, and that the transgression was sufficiently public to trigger damage to her social standing (e.g. if an individual is brought to believe that she performed a public sex act when intoxicated). Conversely, the agent's interest in social standing can be set back if the *public* is made to believe that she has transgressed a social dignitarian norm, even if she hasn't (for instance, if she is a victim of revenge porn in which the relevant image has been doctored).

Like with personal dignity, we have a *prima facie* obligation not to violate one another's social dignity. But just as for personal dignity, there are limits on this obligation. Political humor is a primary example of such limitations. As Michael Rosen notes, "The use of irreverence to strip off the patina that dignity adds to power is often painful and shocking" (2012, 73). Nonetheless, he strenuously opposes the idea that such humiliations of the powerful ought to be restricted. We can go some way towards vindicating Rosen's claim by focusing on the harm of being held in contempt. There is no denying that such harms accompany much political humor. To give just one example: a prominent Australian cartoonist, First Dog on the Moon, regularly represents the current Immigration Minister, Peter Dutton, as a brussels sprout. It is hard to interpret this as anything other than a public invitation to view Dutton with contempt. Indeed, as Rosen acknowledges, "political caricatures are *supposed* to challenge the dignity of those they depict, and so, no doubt, they 'devalue the individual in question' " (2012, 76).

The fact that loss of social standing is a harm, however, does not yet suffice to prove that social dignity violations are always wrong. One question we need to ask is whether social dignity violations can occur *without* a loss of social standing. This, I claim, is the appropriate way to understand the ridiculing of politicians. A further question we need to ask is whether the individual in question is *entitled* to maintain her social standing. There are three key ways in which such an entitlement might be called into doubt: if the social standing in question can only be maintained through the denigration of others; if the community within which her social standing is at issue is "out of bounds"; or if she has voluntarily transgressed the norm in virtue of which her social standing is reduced.

Of course, when we're in the realm of social dignity violations we're not just concerned with social standing—the psychological harms of social shame must also be brought into the equation. These psychological harms act as a check on how humiliation can be wielded as a tool, and against whom. As we saw in the discussion of personal dignity above, we ought not to gratuitously cause psychological pain; but these types of harms can only ever factor as *pro tanto* reasons in our moral calculous, and may well be outweighed by other ends. I'll thus bracket the psychological harms in what follows, focusing on the more difficult issues of when dignity violations come apart from loss of social standing, and when we're entitled to maintain our social standing. It should be remembered throughout, though, that even those who lack grounds to complain of loss of social standing may nonetheless have grounds to complain at the infliction of gratuitous or excessive psychological pain.

If someone enjoys high levels of political power, they often lack one of the usual grounds to complain if they are subjected to public ridicule. This is because political office functions to insulate individuals from the loss of social standing that typically accompanies being held in contempt. For most of us, our social power will be a direct reflection of the esteem in which we're held—the extent to which we can exert influence, have our voice heard, and our interests taken into consideration, will depend on how highly thought of we are. For those who hold institutional positions of power, by contrast, their ability to influence the social world is embedded in their official role—even when they are held in contempt, they maintain a higher level of social standing than most of us can aspire to. Moreover, precisely because politicians' social standing is typically highly elevated, a slight drop in that social standing does not compromise the interest in social power that underpins the *prima facie* claim against social dignity violations. The kind of mockery performed by political cartoonists and comedians can thus be seen as an attempt to chip away at an elevated social standing ("bringing them down a peg"), without thereby posing a plausible threat to the target's interests. We can contrast this with the mockery of minorities that is more commonly regulated in liberal societies, for instance via laws against hate speech.[^18] Since the purpose of such regulation is to protect those whose social standing is already improperly deflated, it is at least *prima facie* justifiable on social dignitarian grounds.

Let's turn now to cases in which an individual lacks entitlement to her social standing, and is thus not wronged when her social standing is reduced through a social dignity violation. One way in which social dignity violations may fail to be wrong is if their avoidance can only be secured through the denigration of others. This mirrors the discussion of personal dignity above, where I argued that we have no claim against a personal dignity violation if this presupposes obligations incompatible with the other agent's rights. For instance, we can suppose that in the pre-Civil War South of the US, social standing within the class of slave owners would have been damaged by a runaway slave. Nonetheless, it is clear that slave-owners would have had no legitimate dignitarian grounds for complaint here: their social dignity manifestly could not justify obligations on others to remain enslaved. Or imagine a community of police officers whose social standing within that group depends upon displays of subservience from some class of citizens. In other words, if a member of that class refused to behave in an obsequious manner towards a police officer, that police officer would lose social standing with her community of fellow police officers. Again, the police officer would have no grounds for complaint if a member of that class refused to behave obsequiously towards her, because although her social standing would indeed be lowered, her social dignity does not justify obligations on others to act in ways contrary to their own self-respect.

An additional way in which a social dignity violation may not be wrong is if the individual lacks entitlement to social standing within a particular community, because membership of the group is itself morally impermissible. Take the example of neo-Nazi groups, which I hope we can all still agree are morally impermissible to join, even if we disagree on the appropriateness of state regulation. To force an individual to transgress that group's social norms, or to expose him as having transgressed one of their norms, does not necessarily wrong him, because he had no entitlement to social standing within that group in the first place. If such dignity violations are ever wrong, then, it is purely on grounds of the psychological harms they cause, or because in the process they violate other rights. An example to illustrate this point will be helpful. Take the interesting case of Mike Enoch, an American neo-Nazi. In 2017, as part of a broader doxxing incident, it was revealed that Enoch's wife was Jewish. This, unsurprisingly, caused him to lose standing within his community of neo-Nazis. Bracketing the means by which this exposure occurred, and hence the rights to privacy that may be in play here, the mere fact of being brought into disregard in the eyes of one's fellow neo-Nazis gave Enoch no grounds for complaint, since we have no claim to any level of social standing within communities to which it is impermissible to belong.

Finally, an individual may lack grounds to complain about a social dignity violation if she has voluntarily transgressed the relevant social norm. Social dignity is violated when we are publicly presented as having transgressed the community's dignitarian norms. It follows from this that we can violate someone's social dignity by exposing her as having transgressed norms, where that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. In other words, to "name and shame" is to violate social dignity. Such social dignity violations, while they undoubtedly lower the target's social standing and elicit the painful feeling of social shame, are in at least some cases justified. For instance, if an academic has engaged in serial sexual harassment of students, alerting the academic community to these actions is justifiable, even though his social standing will presumably be reduced. This is because he is no longer entitled to the level of social standing that he had previously enjoyed—he voluntarily transgressed the community's norms, and hence has no grounds for complaint when those transgressions result in loss of social standing.

That said, cases of voluntary transgression of social norms are more fraught than the other ways in which someone might lack entitlement to maintain her social standing. Consider the case of outing someone as having had gay sex, in the context of a religious community that takes such behavior to be debasing. This is structurally analogous to the naming and shaming of the sexually harassing professor: someone has been exposed as having voluntarily transgressed the community's dignitarian standards. Yet in this case, it seems clear that the outed individual has grounds for complaint.[^19]

We need to be careful in how this asymmetry is to be explained. An important difference between the two cases undoubtedly lies in the respective norms: it is perfectly appropriate for someone to lose social standing for sexual harassment, while it is inappropriate for someone to lose social standing for their sexual orientation. Nonetheless, is would be a mistake to conclude that we only have a moral claim against social dignity violations if the relevant social norms are objectively true, and for all the same reasons we saw with personal dignity above. Recall the case of the Abu Ghraib detainees forced to simulate gay sex: this is clearly a social as well as personal dignity violation, and it is also clearly a violation against which the detainees had a valid moral claim. However, the relevant social norm is identical to the one at play in the case of outing someone for having gay sex.

The solution to this puzzle, I propose, lies with the possibility of rights forfeiture. In both the academic and the religious community examples, we can stipulate that the relevant groups are not morally out of bounds, and maintaining social standing in those groups does not require the denigration of others. As such, the individuals in question are entitled to the social standing they hold prior to the transgression of the social dignitarian norm, and thereby have a moral claim against others causing their social standing to be reduced. In both cases, we can also stipulate that the individuals in question voluntarily transgress the relevant norm (I'll address the issue of sexual identity as opposed to voluntary sexual activity shortly). The question now becomes when voluntary actions suffice to forfeit your claim against others bringing about a lowering of your social standing. At this juncture, introducing conditions on the relevant norm seems appropriate: failure to abide by an unreasonable or unjustifiable social norm does not make it permissible for others to lower your social standing, whereas failure to abide by a morally appropriate social norm does. This explains the difference between naming and shaming the academic sexual harasser, and outing someone for engaging in gay sex in a conservative religious community.[^20]

It is important to reiterate, however, that the justifiability of the relevant social norm only matters in contexts of rights forfeiture; it does not play a role in assessing whether someone has a claim against having her social dignity violated through means other than naming and shaming.

I have deliberately constructed the above examples to ensure their symmetry, by keeping them within the realm of voluntary actions. When we consider practices of outing, however, this example is somewhat forced: what's typically being outed is not so much the voluntary activity, but rather the identity. Simply *being* gay suffices to be in transgression of many communities' dignitarian norms.[^21] As we saw in Chapter 2, the mere fact of existing, for people possessing stigmatized social identities, is to be perpetually socially shamed. To "out" someone as possessing such a social identity, then, is to invite her community to view her with contempt simply for who she is—it is to violate her social dignity in the most profound way. Since there are no defeaters to someone's claim against having her social dignity violated in this way, outing someone as having a particular social identity is a significant moral wrong.

I have primarily focused above on the rare cases in which inviting a community to view a member with contempt could be justified, but it is important to remember that such cases will be exceedingly rare. While it may well be permissible to ridicule politicians for their foibles, or to refuse to kowtow to officials, or to expose the hypocrisy of neo-Nazis, for most of us, most of the time, our interest in maintaining our social standing, alongside our interest in avoiding the burden of social shame, suffices to ground a moral claim against having our social dignity violated.

### 3.2 Frustration and Destruction of Social Dignity

To close out this chapter, I consider our interest in avoiding frustration or destruction of social dignity. Much of the work has already been done in considering the scope of our claims against social dignity violations, and so I will move much more quickly over this terrain.

Social dignity is frustrated when we are prevented from upholding norms that our community takes to be ennobling. As such, we can bracket our interest in avoiding social shame, since it is not at stake here. Rather, the relevant interest lies exclusively in improving our social standing. Insofar as people have an interest in being more highly esteemed by their peers, and accordingly holding more social power, frustrations of social dignity are harmful. As for frustrations of personal dignity, though, the extent of the harm associated with frustrations of social dignity depends very much on circumstances. If an individual occupies a precarious position within the community, it is far more important for her to be able to engage in ennobling behavior than for someone who is already held in high esteem. Prisoners, people, and those in care homes all occupy precarious social positions, and hence have a much stronger interest in avoiding social dignity frustrations. What few avenues remain open to these individuals to be raised in their communities' eyes are deeply precious, and should be guarded with care. For instance, providing prisoners with opportunities to study, and then use their newfound skills to help one another, is an important avenue for enhancing their social standing; cutting such programs either for budgetary or retributive reasons thus imposes social dignitarian costs over and above the direct loss of educational opportunity. Likewise, providing those in care homes with space and support to demonstrate their skills, whether through leading classes, or producing art, or gardening, is an important avenue for enhancing their social standing; as is providing homeless people with opportunities for meaningful work. A social dignitarian lens allows us to identify important, and often overlooked, reasons to provide such services.

Again, though, there are limits to the claims we can make on others not to frustrate our dignity. Drawing on Bonnie Mann's (2018) discussion of teenage sexting practices, I'll focus here on two limiting reasons: first, when frustrating someone else's social dignity is necessary to preserve one's own social dignity; and second, when frustrating someone else's social dignity is necessary for their own wellbeing. This discussion is not meant to be exhaustive of the limitations to claims against having one's social dignity frustrated, but rather provide an example of the kinds of factors we need to be attending to in assessing social dignitarian claims.

Referring to a British study on sexting by Ringrose et al., Mann describes teenage sexting practices as follows: "Boys circulate images they convince girls to provide for them, mostly images of girls' breasts, as forms of social currency, and are 'rated' (given respect) by other boys when they do so" (p. 5). While Mann does not use the term dignity to explain this phenomenon, we can nonetheless interpret it through the lens of social dignity. The boys in question are attempting to enhance their social standing with these images; this suggests there is a social dignitarian norm in play within this community, whereby it is ennobling to circulate such pictures. For a girl to refuse to provide such photos to a particular boy, then, can be understood as a frustration of his social dignity: an avenue for enhancing his social standing has been closed off. Of course, such refusals are eminently reasonable, since the boy's interest in enhancing his own social standing falls well short of justifying the corresponding obligation. As we saw above with personal dignity, assessing the viability of a dignitarian claim involves both an analysis of the degree of harm at stake, as well as the nature of the corresponding obligation. The claims of the boys in this study are sorely lacking in both regards.

The phenomenon of sexting is also relevant to social dignitarian claims for another reason, though. Not only the boys, but also the girls, participate in this practice in order to enhance their social dignity. As Mann writes:

> Think about adolescents posting selfies on social media, think of the comments on those photographs: "you're so hot," "what a slut," "he's ripped," "such a pussy." All of those comments are judgments of value, assignations of value, attached to a certain way of doing or being your gender. If your picture is labeled "hot," you are being assigned a value that is high, while if you are "butt ugly" or "fugly," you are being devalued through that assignation. You are worth a lot more as a gendered, sexual being if you are the first. If my gender sometimes seems to be a life or death matter, it is because it is one important way that I justify my existence to myself and others. Without it, I may be worthless. (p. 4)

As odd as it may sound, for a young girl who's liable to be labeled "hot," preventing her from participating in these practices constitutes a frustration of her social dignity. Nonetheless, preventing her from participating would be justified. Most clearly, concern for the girl's general wellbeing outweighs the cost to her social status within her peer group, and hence justifies frustrating her dignity in this case. In addition, though, we can justify preventing her participation on strictly dignitarian grounds. This is because being blocked from participating in such practices would only frustrate the girl's dignity with respect to one particular community of which she's a member; it would not be surprising to find that participating in such practices simultaneously constitutes a social dignity *violation* with respect to different communities of which she's a member (her family, say, or church community). Even if preserving dignity were our only consideration, then, we may nonetheless have reason to frustrate someone's dignity.

I introduce the sexting example to illustrate some of the boundaries of social dignitarian claims. This should not distract us from the fact that social dignity matters, and ensuring people have space to raise themselves in the eyes of their peers is by no means a trivial issue—as the examples of care homes and prisons is intended to show. Nonetheless, social dignity is far from all that matters, and claims against having one's social dignity frustrated will thus be strongest when one occupies a precarious social position, and when the pursuit of social dignity aligns rather than conflicts with one's general wellbeing.

To conclude this discussion of social dignity, we need to consider the phenomenon of social dignity *destruction*. To have one's social dignity destroyed, as we saw in Chapter 2, means that others within a particular community no longer see you as a viable object of either esteem or contempt. This does not necessarily involve complete excommunication from the relevant community (though it might); but it does necessarily involve the adoption of what Strawson (2008) calls the "objective attitude." To have had one's social dignity destroyed is to be seen by one's peers as the wrong kind of creature to esteem, and the wrong kind of creature to feel contempt towards. It is to be placed outside the shared world of appraisal; an object, rather than a person to be assessed as a fellow member of a community.

It's important to note that destruction of social dignity is not always unwelcome. Individuals may well not want to be held to the dignitarian norms of a certain community, because they reject them. For instance, someone who has chosen to leave a religious community may not care that her previous co-members consider her lost, and no longer see her as worthy of either esteem of contempt, because she takes the grounds for that esteem or contempt to be misguided. When individuals *do* continue to endorse the dignitarian norms of communities they take themselves to be members of, though, it can be devastating to be deemed beneath contempt.

I've already noted that the social dignity of homeless people is highly precarious. This is especially true with regard to their vulnerability to social dignity destruction. So often, their fellow community members simply refuse to see them—those sleeping rough become just another obstacle to be navigated around on the daily commute. What cannot (or will not) be seen cannot be appraised, and so this decision not to see can, in the aggregate, lead to a destruction of social dignity.

This situation is rendered complex, though, due to the tension between respecting an individual's privacy and failing to see her. Those who are living on the streets are forced to perform many acts society deems private in public.[^22] It can feel like an act of caring to choose not to see, or choose not to judge, a homeless individual for acts that transgress social dignitarian norms. If we are to hold the homeless in their social dignity, however, such decisions not to see or judge need to be engaged in carefully; it is a very fine psychological balancing act between refraining from holding in contempt, and taking to be beneath contempt.

I have argued that we have limited moral claims to personal and social dignity, based on our interests in avoiding shame and securing esteem. Those interests are tied to personal and social dignity because of the way in which these two strands involve *appraisal respect—*whether our own, or our peers'. Status dignity, by contrast, involves *recognition respect*, and this means the interests at play are very different. Accordingly, the scope of our moral claims to status dignity—which includes our moral claims to human dignity—must be addressed separately. I turn to that task now.

[^1]: My focus is on the possibility that our vulnerability to shame grounds others' obligations towards us. I thus leave aside the question of when and how feeling shame may be morally valuable. For discussions of that question, see (Calhoun 2004, Sommers 2018, Tiwald 2017).
[^2]: Such an attitude has echoes of what Robin Dillon has called "basal self-respect." Dillon introduces this term precisely in order to differentiate it from agents' reflective judgments. Basal self-respect, according to Dillon, is: <blockquote> a more fundamental orientation toward the self that underlies recognition and evaluative self-respect, a prereflective, unarticulated, emotionally laden presuppositional interpretive framework, an implicit 'seeing oneself as' or 'taking oneself to be' that structures our explicit experiences of self and worth. (Dillon 1997, 241)</blockquote>Dillon's basal self-respect is an enduring attitude; an orientation to oneself. Shame, as I am understanding it, *can* have this enduring quality, but it need not—we can experience episodes of shame, which temporarily lower us in our own eyes.
[^3]: Cf. (Tangney and Dearing 2003) who observe, "when people feel shame . . .they are berating themselves not just for the specific event; rather, they are damning themselves—the core of their being—as flawed, useless, despicable. In this way shame experiences pose a tremendous threat to the self " (p. 92).
[^4]: I am assuming here that we can have interests that do not reduce to physical effects, such that our interests can be set back even if no physiological change occurs. For instance, someone's interests may be set back if her partner is unfaithful, even if she never discovers this fact—her interest here is not simply in avoiding the emotional pain of infidelity, but of actually being in a certain kind of relationship. Likewise, I am suggesting, our interest in avoiding dignity violations is not merely an interest in avoiding emotional pain, but also of standing in a certain kind of relationship to ourselves.
[^5]: This leaves one type of personal dignity violation unaccounted for: if an individual's personal dignity is violated but she is unaware of the fact, then she will not incur the psychological harm of shame, nor the downstream negative agential effects that typically accompany shame; in addition, if the individual does not reflectively endorse the dignitarian norm she has been forced to transgress, then she will not incur a harm to integrity. What, then, should we say about a case in which someone is forced to do something she has a disposition to think less of herself for, but without that disposition being activated? I think the most we can say about such case is that the individual is harmed in virtue of her self-regard being *threatened*. Her selfregard has become unstable and contingent, dependent on continued ignorance. Insofar as we have an interest in secure self-regard, personal dignity violations harm us even if we are unaware they have taken place, and even if we reflectively reject the dignitarian norm we have been forced to transgress.
[^6]: Kate Manne's (2017, 121–2) discussion of family annihilators, and what she calls their "entitled sense of shame" is distressingly relevant to this point: at the extreme, some people seek to destroy those before whom they feel ashamed. (I suspect Manne primarily has in mind what I'm calling *social*, as opposed to *personal* shame—but I am inclined to think both emotions are potentially at play here.)
[^7]: Cf. (Thomson 1986).
[^8]: She may have prudential reasons, of course. As any woman who's been approached by a Barry will no doubt be all too painfully aware, rebuffing such approaches can provoke a violent response. Since I'm only concerned here with what we owe one another morally, I leave such considerations aside. Henceforth, my discussion of reasons should be read as shorthand for *moral* reasons,
[^9]: For more on the conceptual relationship between rights and duties, see (Hohfeld 1917).
[^10]: Thanks to Rob Sparrow for pushing me to think about the importance of vulnerability.
[^11]: Similarly, many states have the means to ensure that homeless people are provided with facilities to, say, wash their clothes. Since being forced to appear in public in dirty clothes is something many people would find debasing, homeless people (at least within relatively welloff states) plausibly have a right to things like clothes-washing services.
[^12]: The debate over torture has been well-worn, and I won't reiterate it here. Suffice to say, the evidence strongly suggests torture is both ineffective as a means of information gathering, and counterproductive as a means of preventing future terrorist attacks. Since there is no overwhelming need to torture, we cannot have a duty to torture. It is also worth noting that the most common defense of torture, i.e. the ticking time-bomb scenario, cannot plausibly be wheeled in here, since destruction of torture takes time, and the ticking time-bomb scenario presupposes time-sensitivity. For arguments against torture, see (Wolfendale 2009, Luban 2009, Brecher 2007, Bufacchi and Arrigo 2006)*.* Those who defend torture, in at least some circumstances, include (Steinhoff 2013, Allhoff 2012).
[^13]: I'm sure some imaginative philosopher would be able to conjure up a far-fetched scenario on which one person's dignity needed to be destroyed in order to save the lives of millions of innocent people. My claim is not that it's *inconceivable* for the claim against personal dignity destruction to be outweighed, but rather that such a claim should be taken as given in all scenarios we're likely to encounter in the world as it actually is.
[^14]: Not all attempts to reducing social standing will be successful. As Cheshire Calhoun astutely notes, the power to bring about social shame is not evenly distributed. As she puts it, "the power to shame is likely to be concentrated in the hands of those whose interpretations are socially authoritative" (Calhoun 2004, 143).
[^15]: This does not require that we endorse the standards against which we're judged as falling short. Adrian Piper (1992, 76), in her paper "Passing for White, Passing for Black," describes her experience as a new postgraduate student in philosophy, and the public shaming she is subject to by a professor. She writes movingly of the groundless shame of the inadvertent imposter, exposed to public ridicule or accusation. For this kind of shame, you don't actually need to have done anything wrong. All you need to do is care about others' image of you, and fail in your actions to reinforce their positive image of themselves. Their ridicule and accusations then function to disown and degrade you from their status, to mark you as not having *done* wrong but as *being* wrong.
[^16]: Neither personal nor social shame quite captures shame as understood by Bernard Williams (1993). According to Williams, we should understand shame as a social emotion, as per social shame; however, only those whose moral judgments we respect have the power to induce shame. Nor does my analysis of shame quite capture what David Velleman (2001) takes to be fundamental to the emotion, namely threats to our standing as self-presenting creatures. While I find both of these accounts of shame compelling in their own right, they do not track what I take to be of central importance in understanding dignity violations, and so I leave them aside here.
[^17]: This is a point that is also emphasized by defenders of a politics of recognition. See, e.g., (Fraser and Honneth 2003, Honneth and Anderson 2005, Taylor 1994).
[^18]: See, for instance, Section 18C of Australia's Racial Discrimination Act, which states that:<blockquote> <br> (1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: <br> - (a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and <br> - (b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.</blockquote> This raises the question of hate speech directed at otherwise powerful politicians, for instance the misogynistic attacks leveled against Australia's ex-Prime Minister Julia Gillard.<br>There are multiple pathways by which such speech would be wrong, on dignitarian grounds. First, public office is not a *foolproof* insulation against loss of social standing. When contempt is directed at a politician in virtue of her marginalized social identity (gender, race, sexuality, etc.), its effects are magnified by the society's existing dispositions towards members of those groups. There are levels of contempt, or better yet types of contempt, that undercut the power typically wielded by those in office. Moreover, even where a particular politician's social standing *is* insulated from these effects, hate speech by its very nature targets *everyone* bearing the relevant identity. *Their* social standing provides grounds to object to derogation of politicians that goes by way of marginalized social identities.
[^19]: Though I recognize the implausibility, I'm here bracketing the physical danger such outing imposes on its victims, so that we can focus in on the moral import of social standing.
[^20]: It also provides an alternative way to justify a cartoonist presenting Peter Dutton as a brussels sprout, which we can also read as a metaphorical form of naming and shaming. The norms Dutton is being presented as violating, through his advocacy of the inestimably cruel practice of offshore detention of asylum seekers, more than suffice to forfeit his claim to maintain his social standing within the Australian community.
