# 4. Dignity and Recognition

Chapter 3 examined the scope of our moral claims to the protection of personal or social dignity. These two strands of dignity were treated together because they both involve *appraisal* respect; what's primarily at risk, when personal or social dignity is threatened, is the esteem in which we're held, either by ourselves or by others. Status dignity operates slightly differently, given its entanglement with *recognition*, as opposed to appraisal, respect. The purpose of this chapter is to consider the general scope of moral claims to the protection of status dignity, which essentially means the scope of our moral claims to be treated with recognition respect.

To treat someone with recognition respect is to treat her in accordance with her membership in a particular social category. To violate someone's status dignity, then, is to fail to treat her in accordance with the recognition respect she commands in virtue of her membership in a particular social category—as a fellow citizen, say, or as a judge. (For now, I'll bracket the issue of *human* dignity—that is a sufficiently important topic to justify a chapter of its own.) There are two key ways to violate someone's status dignity. First, we can refuse to see her *as* a member of a social category to which she belongs, and hence as entitled to the relevant form of recognition respect. This kind of social dignity violation will be familiar to many women and people of color, who are frequently denied the forms of respect to which they're entitled because others simply fail to see them as members of the relevant category—so a woman may be addressed as if she were a nurse, when in fact she's a doctor; or a person of color may be addressed as if he were wait-staff, when in fact he's a CEO. Such violations of status dignity will be very hard to distinguish in practice from another kind, in which the individual *is* seen as a member of the relevant social category, but the relevant norms of treatment are not extended to her. For instance, someone introducing keynote speakers at an academic conference might introduce each by their title, apart from the sole woman, who is introduced by her first name; or a police officer might fail to treat an African-American suspect in accordance with her civil rights, even while acknowledging that she is a citizen. The fact that these two kinds of violations can be hard to distinguish in practice is indicative of their interconnectedness: to refuse to treat someone as a member of a social category *just is* to communicate (intentionally or otherwise) that she is not entitled to that status, and hence to call her membership of the social category into question.[^1]

While the previous examples should be familiar, and recognizably morally problematic, the moral import of status dignity is by no means transparent. Status dignity attaches to membership in social categories, and the recognition respect that it commands is a product of the *social meaning* of those categories—which in turn reflects the norms and practices through which those categories come into being and are sustained. How, though, could we have a *moral* claim to recognition respect, given that its source lies exclusively in social, rather than moral, norms and practices? That is the central question to be addressed in this chapter, as we investigate the scope of our claims to status dignity. To answer it, we need to first grapple with the nature and normativity of social kinds.

## 1. The Nature and Normativity of Social Kinds

When we talk of social categories, we are talking about social *kinds*. What a social kind is can most easily be understood in contrast to a natural kind. Following Bird and Tobin (2016), we can understand natural kinds as "correspond[ing] to a grouping that reflects the structure of the natural world rather than the interests and actions of human beings." Social kinds, conversely, can be understood to refer to groupings that exist in virtue of human activity. Common examples of social kinds include money, royalty, nation-states, and citizens. None of these categories reflect the mind-independent structure of the natural world, and all owe their existence to social norms, formal rules, and institutional practices.

Of course, the distinction between natural and social kinds is not as neat as this brief sketch suggests. Where, for instance, would dogs fall on this taxonomy, given the role of human activity in their domestication and breeding? And what should we say about plastic? I hope to side-step such vexed boundary questions here, and also to stay neutral with respect to the related debate over whether there even are such things as natural kinds. My use of the term "social kinds" is intended to draw attention to categories that not only causally owe their existence to human activity, but whose meaning and membership conditions continue to depend on, and hence be shaped by, human practices. More precisely, I am concerned with an important sub-category of social kinds that picks out what have come to be known as *human* kinds—these are *categories of people* that exist in virtue of social conventions, rather than categories that exist independently, as part of the natural world.[^2] We have already encountered two examples of human kinds: royalty and citizens. To this we could add celebrities; Catholics; women; white people; students; politicians; prisoners; and so on. To say that such kinds are socially constructed is not to say that they are mere fictions, nor that they lack material reality.[^3] Rather, it is to say that the category came into existence, and continues to exist, because of the norms, practices, and institutions with which it is entwined.

Because human kinds are conventional rather than natural, the meaning of membership, including what people are owed *qua* membership, is also conventional: since there is nothing in the natural world, independent of human practices, to which the category answers, there is nothing in the natural world that could (fully) justify the meanings we attach to membership, or the norms of treatment we accept with respect to members. The kind exists because intentionally or otherwise—we have created it. To recognize that fact is to recognize the unavailability of at least one avenue of vindication of our practices. For instance, once royalty is understood to be a socially constructed and sustained political role, rather than a naturally ordained intrinsic feature of certain select individuals, we cannot point to God's (or mother nature's) plan to justify the continued existence of the role, how its particular occupants are selected, or the norms of treatment royals command.

This form of argument has been most prominently advanced in the context of gender, with some feminist theories arguing that "woman" does not pick out a natural category, and hence who's a woman, what it means to be a woman, and the norms that are associated with being a woman, are not grounded in immutable biological facts, but instead are contingent social constructions.[^4] As such, we cannot point to nature to justify the norms to which women are subject. Similar arguments are leveled with respect to race: even if there were some notion of race at the epidemiological level that tracks natural kinds, the notion of race that is most salient to people's lives is a social construct, and hence what it means to be Black, and the norms associated with being Black, cannot be determined by appeal to biological facts, but owe whatever status they have to social conventions.[^5]

The social categories to which status dignity attaches are all instances of human kinds. They are all categories of people whose existence is established and maintained by social conventions, rather than the mind-independent natural world. It thus follows that what it means to be a member, and what forms of recognition respect are owed to members, are to be explained by social conventions rather than members' intrinsic features. This is why the moral import of status dignity violations is far from obvious: how could we be *morally* required to recognize someone as a member of a particular human kind, and hence as deserving of specific forms of recognition respect, when both the kind itself and the corresponding norms are the product of social convention?

It may seem obvious that human kinds are incapable of generating the right kind of moral obligation; that we could not possibly be morally obligated to recognize someone as a member of a category that we've constructed, nor to uphold the corresponding norms of treatment, and hence that status dignitarian claims are morally idle.[^6] Indeed, much of the point of a social constructionist analysis is typically to "debunk" the norms and expectations attached to social kinds, exposing them as contingent or foundationless.[^7]

My goal in this chapter is to show that status dignitarian claims are *not* morally idle, because we can (at least sometimes) be morally obligated to respect someone's claim to membership in a human kind, as well as the forms of recognition respect attached to it.

To motivate the claim that membership in social kinds can ground moral claims, consider the following hypothetical cases:

> **Toy Library**: A council has decided to offer the following service to local families: they will stock a toy library, which all parents are entitled to use. However, the council stipulates that the service will be restricted to *biological* parents; adoptive parents will not qualify to use it. When pressed on the exclusion, the council retorts that the only 'real' category is biological parent; anything else is just a social construct, which they're under no obligation to recognize.

> **Roll Call**: A high school teacher calls the roll for her class each morning. Each student is called by name—except Chad. When it gets to his place in the roll, the teacher simply points, and says 'you there'. When Chad protests this treatment, the teacher retorts that calling students by their name is merely a social convention, and hence she is under no obligation to treat him that way.[^8]

Toy Library hopefully illustrates that we can be morally obligated to uphold someone's claim to be recognized as a member of a socially constructed category. There is no natural kind that encompasses both biological and adoptive parents: the category "parent" refers to a social role, so what it means to be a parent, and hence who counts as a parent, is a product of both informal norms and institutional practices.[^9] Nonetheless, it seems clear that the local council is making a moral, and not just a metaphysical, mistake with their policy. That is, the adoptive parents can rightly claim that they have been morally wronged. However, this wrong cannot be explained in terms of any independent moral claims adoptive parents have to accessing a toy library this is a discretionary provision offered by the council, not a service that the council is obligated to provide for citizens. The mistake must thus lie in the refusal to recognize adoptive parents *as* parents; and this is simply a refusal to recognize someone's claim to membership in a socially constructed category.

Roll Call, by contrast, hopefully illustrates that we can be morally obligated to uphold norms of treatment attached to membership in human kinds. Chad has grounds for moral complaint here—he is being *wronged* even though his entitlement to be addressed by name by his teacher is the product of a social convention, rather than an independent moral right. (This point may be somewhat obscured by the ubiquity of calling-by-name as a form of recognition respect across different human kinds, especially in Anglo-American societies. To see that it's nonetheless a social convention rather than an independent moral right, we need simply consider cultures in which addressing someone by their name is considered rude.)

While Toy Library and Roll Call are intended to motivate the claim that we can be morally obligated to respect people's claims to membership in human kinds, and uphold the norms of treatment attached to human kinds, they are not intended to suggest that we are *always* morally obligated to respect status dignitarian claims. This is because human kinds can be interwoven with severe oppression. Consider the human kind "white" in the Jim Crow era South of the United States. According to the social norms operative at the time, to be white was to be owed very particular forms of recognition respect. For instance, it was to be entitled to the exclusion of people of color from many of one's public spaces. It follows, then, that protests such as the famous Woolworth's sit-in in Greensboro North Carolina constituted a violation of white people's status dignity—it was a refusal to treat them with the recognition respect called for by their membership in the social category "white."[^10] Clearly, though, such action did not *wrong* white people.

Moreover, this absence of wrongdoing is not fully explained by pointing to the moral imperative of desegregation: it is not that the dignitarian claims of white people were *outweighed* by the moral goods to be brought about through the protest. Rather, analogously to Barry in Chapter 3, the dignitarian harms here *fail to ground moral claims at all*. What we need, then, is a way to explain how membership in social categories—and more specifically, human kinds—can ground moral claims in some cases, but not in others.[^11] As with previous chapters it will be useful to start with status dignity violations, since this is where the moral issues are most pointed, before applying the analysis to status dignity frustrations and destruction.

## 2. Status Dignity Violations

We can start to make progress on the question of whether, why, and when status dignity violations are wrong by considering a different, and more well-known, way in which social categories ground moral claims, and then draw on that framework to develop criteria appropriate for claims against having one's status dignity violated. Political philosophers will be familiar with the idea of *legitimate expectations*. If an institution has formal and public rules about who is a member, and what members are entitled to, this generates expectations around which people structure their lives, and hence grounds moral claims. For example, if a university has clear criteria for entry (to take a simplified Australian example: anyone who achieves an Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank above 75 is entitled to a place in a Monash Arts Degree), and a student, Mary, meets that criteria, then it would be a moral wrong for the university to deny Mary entry to the degree. Likewise, if Monash had established a precedent that all students are entitled to a free laptop, then it would be a moral wrong to refuse to give a particular student, Vinh, a laptop.

What's important to note about these examples is that Mary and Vinh have no prior moral claim to either entry to a certain degree, or to a laptop. What moral claim they have is both generated and determined by the rules of the institution, and how these rules affect their agency. Mary could reasonably have turned down a different offer, assuming her entry into the Arts degree was guaranteed; Vinh could reasonably have used his limited savings to travel, assuming his laptop needs would be taken care of. To deny people access to what they have been led to believe is their due frustrates their agency, which is why we have at least a *prima facie* claim against it. Nonetheless, as the literature on legitimate expectations amply attests, not all epistemically reasonable expectations ground moral claims: the *legitimacy* requirement does real work in determining whether an expectation has moral force.[^12] Most theories of legitimate expectations would agree, I take it, that while a police officer in the contemporary US may have the epistemically reasonable expectation that she would not be charged for shooting an unarmed civilian, and her behavior may well reflect that expectation, she would nonetheless lack any *legitimate* expectation not to be charged if she shot an unarmed civilian.

I am not suggesting that legitimate expectations explain the moral wrongdoing in Toy Library or Roll Call. Whatever is going on in those examples, it seems clear that frustrations of agency are far from the most salient problem. What the discussion of legitimate expectations *does* show, however, is that socially constructed norms of membership and treatment can ground moral claims. To make the transition from legitimate expectations to claims against having one's status dignity violated, two key shifts are required. First, we need to identify the interests at stake in status dignity violations, which play the role that frustrations of agency play in violations of legitimate expectations; and second, we need to establish a validity condition for claims against violations of status dignity, to play the role that "legitimacy" does in the context of legitimate expectations.

Returning to our two examples of Toy Library and Roll Call can help us identify the interests at stake in status dignity violations. In both cases, I suggest, the agents in question are being denied uptake of who they are: the adoptive parents are denied recognition of their parenthood; Chad is denied recognition of his status as a student. In each case, then, the treatment they receive constitutes an affront to their *identity*. We can understand this affront to identity both as a harm to self-understanding, and as a harm to social position.

When others refuse to treat us as members of the human kinds to which we take ourselves to belong, it can cause a profound wound to our self-understanding. This is especially so for human kinds that are prominent and pervasive, such as race and gender, which infuse and inform many of the other axes of our identity.[^13] As Charles Taylor (1994) has persuasively argued, we come to understand who we are in dialogue with those around us: "my discovering my own identity doesn't mean that I work it out in isolation, but that I negotiate it through dialogue, partly overt, partly internal, with others. . . .My own identity crucially depends on my dialogical relations with others" (p. 34). Our identities are in this way precarious—maintaining a healthy self-understanding requires having our identity accurately reflected back to us in our interactions with others. Importantly, people's identities are frequently interwoven with membership in human kinds: their gender, their race, their religion, their nationality, and so on. To maintain a healthy self-understanding thus requires others to treat us as members of the human kinds to which we take ourselves to belong.

As noted at the outset of this chapter, the threat here comes not just from others explicitly denying our membership (as is the case in Toy Library), but can also come from others refusing to treat us in accordance with the relevant norms, irrespective of where they stand on our membership. This is because norms of treatment function to reaffirm our membership: every time we are treated as members ought to be treated, it reinforces our belonging. Such treatment both lays the groundwork for coming to understand ourselves as members of the relevant kinds, and reaffirms those aspects of our identity over time. Conversely, though, every time others refuse to treat us as members ought to be treated, they are corroding the extent to which we can be confident in our belonging. For example, consider a devout Christian who is refused communion at their local church, perhaps because of their sexuality or gender identity—it would be unsurprising if their identity as Christian was experienced as fraught. Being treated as if we are not members of a particular human kind can sow the seeds of self-doubt, fracturing our understanding of who we are.

This raises the question of how far such interests extend: in particular, why should it matter that others see me as a member of socially constructed categories, if those categories are not ones around which I build my identity? In other words, why think I have any interest in being seen as a woman, a Dr., an Australian, or any other category to which I currently belong, but see as peripheral to who I am? An individual's interest in being seen as a member of a social category is in part a function of the social meaning of being treated as a *non*-member.[^14] Since social categories mediate the forms of respect we receive, a key way in which we can *dis*respect someone is by treating her as if she were not a member of the relevant human kind. To treat someone as a non-member picks her out as unworthy, expressing the attitude that she is somehow lesser, or deviant. Status dignity violations thus share with social dignity violations the fact that they pose a threat to social standing. Importantly, the harm here can come apart from how much the individual is invested in the relevant human kind, and hence how much her self-understanding is threatened. I may not give two hoots about being a Dr.; but if someone deliberately and pointedly continues to call me "Miss," it will be experienced as a slight. Conversely, I may wholeheartedly reject the norms that attach to membership in the social kind "woman," and yet still object to being deliberately misgendered in an online comment thread (indeed, I may plausibly take such deliberate misgendering to be an instance of hate speech).[^15]

Denials of who we are and what we're thereby owed function to position us in the eyes of others. Such treatment is a message to the wider community (whether intentional or not) that this person does not belong. To return to an earlier example, for a church to deny someone communion not only affects that individual's sense of identity, but communicates to the entire congregation that the individual is not a full member of the church. Similarly, Jeremy Waldron (2012b) has argued in favor of the regulation of hate speech on the basis that such speech violates the requirement to treat co-citizens as equals. Citizens, Waldron claims, are entitled "to be treated as equals in the ordinary operations of society." Hate speech, however "aims to besmirch the basics of their reputation, by associating ascriptive characteristics like ethnicity, or race, or religion with conduct or attributes that should disqualify someone from being treated as a member of society in good standing" (p. 5). My ability to be seen by others as a member in good standing of a particular human kind, then, depends on others' willingness to treat me in accordance with the existing norms for how members ought to be treated—it depends, that is, on others not violating my status dignity.

The harms inherent to status dignity violations can also be understood in terms of Jessica Wolfendale's (2017) notion of "moral security":

> Broadly speaking, a person possesses *subjective* moral security when she believes that her basic interests and welfare will be accorded moral recognition by others in her community and by social, political, and legal institutions in her society. She possesses *objective* moral security if, as a matter of fact, her interests and welfare are regarded by her society as morally important—for example, when violent crimes against her are taken to warrant the same punishment and condemnation as equivalent crimes against others. (italics added)

When an individual is aware that her status dignity has been violated, her subjective moral security is eroded: she has evidence that at least some others in her community do not respect her standing as a member. Whether or not she is aware of the violation, though, her objective moral security is threatened by status dignity violations: at least some people do not take her interests and welfare to matter in a way they ought to, for members. As Wolfendale is at pains to point out, gendered and racial violence undermine the moral security not only of their immediate victims, but also of all those who identify with the targeted groups. This lesson can be extended to status dignity violations: unlike for personal and social dignity violations, the harms of status dignity violations can extend beyond just those who are their immediate targets. When someone's status dignity is violated because of their race, gender, sexuality, religion, ethnicity, or any other social identity, the status of all those who share the social identity is brought into question. (I'll return to this point shortly, since it has implications for whether we are entitled to violate our own status dignity.)

Admittedly, the harms of status dignity violations vary widely in significance. The extent to which one is harmed depends on the level of disrespect being shown (there is a difference between overlooking the relevant norms of treatment, and deliberately mocking those norms); on who is doing the disrespecting (a judge's social standing is barely affected if a child does not stand for her, but is seriously threatened if the District Attorney refuses to stand); and on the social category at play (someone refusing to see me as a Dr. matters far less than someone refusing to see me as a co-citizen). Bearing this variability in mind, we can nonetheless say that violations of status dignity pose a threat to social standing, alongside their threat to self-understanding. These dual harms play the role in grounding moral claims against status dignity violations that frustrations of agency play in grounding moral claims to the fulfillment of legitimate expectations.[^16]

These harms ground a *prima facie* claim against having one's status dignity violated. The next step is to establish criteria to play the role that legitimacy does in legitimate expectations. That is, under what conditions does the *prima facie* claim against having one's status dignity violated succeed?

Before addressing this question, though, two caveats are in order. First, my goal throughout this section is not to make a definitive determination about the moral permissibility of each of the examples discussed, but rather to identify what we would need to know in order to make that determination. My coyness about these determinations reflects the fact that to make them would require a careful sociological analysis of how each of the relevant human kinds functions in their respective societies—and that is not an analysis I am in a position to undertake. The second caveat relates to the broader context of this book, which is to investigate the underexplored moral dimensions of dignity, rather than to offer a complete account of morality or justice. I reiterate this point because many of the examples of status dignity violations I discuss throughout this chapter intersect with, and exacerbate, other forms of oppression. In showing how status dignity violations harm people, I do not for a moment intend to suggest that such violations are the only, or even the primary, problem with oppression. Rather, I hope to show that damage to status dignity is yet one more mode of oppression to which the marginalized are disproportionately vulnerable.

With those caveats in mind, let's begin working through the question of how a claim against having one's status dignity violated might succeed. In other words, what criteria must a claim against having one's dignity violated meet, in order to be valid? Since our focus is on norms attached to human kinds, I propose criteria tailored to the role that human kinds play in our lives.

The first thing to notice about at least some human kinds is the way they function to create and perpetuate social hierarchies. White and Black do not merely signal *separate* categories, they signal *privileged* and *oppressed* categories, respectively (Mills 1997). Crucially, the privilege of the former comes at the expense of the oppression of the latter. Privilege and oppression are functioning here as two sides of the same coin: "white" exists as a privileged category precisely because "Black" exists as an oppressed category, and vice versa. As such, we can think of "white" as an *oppressive* human kind, which stands in contrast to the *oppressed* human kind/s against which its privilege is exercised. Similar claims could be made for "man" and "woman" (de Beauvoir 1989, Haslanger 2000); for "straight" and "gay" (Weber 2001); for "cis" and "trans" (Serano 2016); for "able-bodied" and "disabled" (Barnes 2016); and so on. These are the human kinds for which the debunking move so commonly made in the literature on social kinds seems most appropriate: part of what the debunking argument is doing is exposing as fallacious attempts to justify the subordinate position of social categories, such as women, on naturalistic grounds. This suspicion towards hierarchical human kinds should extend to our assessment of claims against status dignity violations, and motivates the first criterion: for a claim against having one's status dignity violated to be valid, upholding it must not perpetuate or exacerbate the oppression of others. Let's unpack this criterion, and the reasons behind it, in more detail.

As we saw above, status dignitarian claims are grounded in the harms to self-understanding or social standing that follow from failures to treat someone in accordance with the forms of recognition respect appropriate to their membership in a particular human kind. In the context of *oppressive* human kinds, however, fulfilling such claims would often be manifestly unjust.

In some cases, simply being recognized *as* a member of an oppressive human kind suffices to perpetuate oppression. To adhere to someone's demand to be recognized as white within an Apartheid system, for instance, is to participate in an oppressive practice.[^17] Such recognition reinforces the racial hierarchy, and re-entrenches the appropriateness of separate norms of treatment for different races.[^18] In other cases, the oppression is perpetuated by treating someone in accordance with the norms that attach to the group of which they're a member. This is because treating someone in accordance with the forms of recognition respect appropriate to their membership in an oppressive human kind is a key way in which the oppressive kind persists, and hence is a key way in which the oppressed kind persists *as* an oppressed kind.

To see how this works in practice, take the norm (widespread in many communities) that a man's expertise ought to be deferred to *because* he's a man. To treat him in accordance with this form of recognition respect—to defer to him because he's a man—reinforces the norm that men ought to be deferred to, and in doing so reinforces the norm that women have lower epistemic standing. Within communities for which it is true, sociologically speaking, that to be respected as a man means being deferred to, failure to defer to a man will constitute a violation of his status dignity. Nonetheless, his claim against such a status dignity violation is void: claims whose satisfaction entail the oppression of others are not claims we are entitled to make.

Another clear example of such failure can be seen in a recent case of a young woman pulled over for drink-driving in South Carolina. According to a BBC report: "A US woman arrested after speeding through a stop sign asked police to let her off because she is 'a clean, thoroughbred white girl', officers say" (BBC News 2018). Even if, epistemically speaking, this young woman was correct to assume a norm of letting white women off without charge for such infractions in South Carolina, her status dignitarian claim to be treated accordingly would fail, because of the manifest injustice constituted by such racially differentiated law enforcement.

Cases such as those described above illuminate the ambivalent nature of status dignity. While status dignity violations can constitute a severe moral wrong, they can also occur simply through refusals to treat someone in accordance with the privilege that an unjust social order confers upon them. People such as the young woman in South Carolina presumably *do* experience such treatment as an affront to their dignity, and my account provides a framework through which we can understand that experience. Understanding an experience is not the same as condoning it, though, which it is why it is so important to carefully distinguish between the harms of status dignity violations, and the wrongs of status dignity violations.

We have seen one way in which a status dignitarian claim can be invalid, i.e. if satisfying it perpetuates or exacerbates the oppression of others. There are two further criteria that need to be made explicit, though they have both been implicit throughout. Criterion 2 requires the harm inflicted by the status dignity violation to be sufficiently substantial, while criterion 3 requires the agent's claim to be appropriately grounded in the relevant human kind. Let's look at each of these criteria in a bit more detail.

Criterion 2 takes as its starting point the account of rights offered by Joseph Raz (1986), and utilized in Chapter 3. According to Raz, to have a right is to have an interest of sufficient weight to justify the corresponding duty. When it comes to status dignity, however, the weight of the interest, as well as the onerousness of the corresponding duty, will be highly context-sensitive. While we can make generalizations about the nature of the interests at stake in status dignity violations (i.e. self-understanding and social standing), we cannot thereby infer the existence of a general moral claim against having one's status dignity violated, because there will be many instances in which the threats to those interests will be negligible. It better tracks the moral texture of the issue, I suggest, to take the question of whether we have a moral claim against status dignity violations to only be answerable on a case-by-case basis. As such, for any demand to have one's membership in a human kind recognized, we would need to assess whether, for *this* individual, in *this* situation, the interests at stake are sufficiently weighty to justify the other parties being under an obligation to act accordingly.

As noted above, whether and how much we are harmed by refusals to recognize us as members of various human kinds depends on who is failing to recognize us, since the social meaning of being denied uptake of one's identity shifts with the social context. For example, if my five-year-old niece and her friends refuse to believe that I'm a Doctor, it's very different than if fellow attendees at a conference refuse to believe it. There are numerous further cases in which others' failure to recognize my membership in this human kind does me no harm whatsoever. When I'm making a dinner reservation, when I'm being emailed by someone soliciting donations, when I'm signing in at the gym—in all of these and countless more circumstances neither my self-understanding nor my social standing are plausibly threatened by being addressed as other than "Doctor". In such circumstances, even though it would not be particularly onerous for others to comply, I lack any moral grounds to demand others address me as "Doctor". Sometimes, the "don't you know who I am" response is merely a sign of inflated ego, rather than an indication of real harm.

This point also helps to circumscribe one of the more controversial claims I made in Chapter 2, namely that communities can develop their own norms of membership and treatment, which can then obligate non-members to treat them accordingly. In many cases, when an outsider fails to treat someone in accordance with the relevant forms of recognition respect it carries less force than when an insider does—we are thus unlikely to be morally required to recognize people as members of human kinds that are alien to our cultural frameworks, because such failures of recognition simply do not carry the same social meaning, and hence do not do the same level of harm. That said, when the outsiders are also the dominant group within a shared society, their refusal to recognize people as members of the relevant human kinds *does* carry the potential for significant harm. There is a relevant difference between demanding that distant strangers recognize us as members of human kinds for which they have no equivalent, and demanding that the powerful within our own society cease denying the salience of our communities.

The final criterion is more fraught. According to criterion 3, the agent's claim against having her status dignity violated must be appropriately grounded in the relevant human kind. This means that she must in fact *be* a member of the relevant human kind, and further that the form of recognition respect she is demanding to be treated in accordance with is in fact a norm of treatment for that human kind.[^19] For example, I could not make a valid dignitarian claim that others recognize me as a princess, and curtsey accordingly: and that's simply because I am not a princess. In addition, even if I *were* a princess, I couldn't demand that others lie prostrate on the ground whenever I walk past: that is not a norm of treatment that attaches to being a princess.

While the example of the princess helps to make clear the necessity of the final criterion, it also threatens to obscure a difficulty with it. Focusing instead on gender helps draw this difficulty out. As a cis woman, I can confidently assert that failure to recognize me as a woman constitutes a form of recognition disrespect, because my membership in the social kind "woman" is rarely questioned. For trans women, however, such assertions are significantly more socially contested.[^20] How, then, are we to determine whether someone is a member of the human kind in question, and hence has a valid claim to be recognized as such?

A place to start is with general theories of social kinds. One of the most prominent of these, in recent years, is the account developed by John Searle (1995, 2010). According to Searle, social kinds come into existence through what he calls a "status function declaration." In the simplest cases, an object will come to have a new status—and thereby a new set of deontic powers because of collective recognition of that status. For instance, a stone wall can take on the status of "border," if there is collective recognition that the wall ought not be crossed. In more complex cases—and human kinds would presumably count as complex cases—rules can be developed such that all objects of a certain type are taken to have a particular status, which exceeds the material properties of that object. For instance, all pieces of metal with a particular form and history have the status of "money"—and they have that status because we collectively recognize the rule granting them that status. As Amie Thomasson (2003) puts the point, "institutional facts can exist only if there is collective acceptance of general principles (constitutive rules) that outline sufficient conditions for something to 'count as' having the relevant feature" (p. 586). On a Searlean account, then, an individual would satisfy criterion 3 if and only if she satisfied the socially constructed "rules" for being a member.

For a significant number of human kinds, this approach would presumably work. For instance, when it comes to "royalty", it seems highly plausible to say that the reason I cannot demand to be treated as a princess is because I do not have the right ancestry—and having the right ancestry is a requirement in virtue of our socially constructed rules about "royalty". The same is true, *mutatis mutandis*, for human kinds such as "citizen", "Doctor", or "judge". To be a member of any of these kinds is to satisfy the socially constructed criteria of membership.

The difficulty for the Searlean account is that many—perhaps even most—social kinds lack these explicit and formalized membership conditions. Human kinds are very often contested and in flux, and different subcommunities can have very different "rules" for who counts as a member. This is precisely the case with gender, as is starkly evidenced by the ongoing battles over whether trans women "count" as women.

Moreover, not only does the contested nature of human kinds raise epistemic difficulties over determining the operative rules, those operative rules can shift in accordance with the claims people make about membership. In other words—though admittedly oversimplifying—my claim to be a member of a particular human kind can *make itself true*. If it gets the right kind of uptake, a claim to membership can in effect change the rules. Such claims therefore cannot be dismissed on the grounds that they don't satisfy the preexisting rules (even assuming we could establish what those rules are).

One option here would be to offer a bifurcated account of human kind membership. For human kinds with formalized rules of membership, such as royalty or judiciary, we can appeal to the Searlean picture to determine whether criterion 3 is satisfied. For the remaining human kinds, we could then appeal to an alternative account of human kind membership. An obvious contender here, especially given the observation about claims to membership potentially changing the conditions of membership, would be Ásta's recently developed conferralist account. According to Ásta (2018), membership in a social kind is conferred by the first-order actions or judgments of other social actors, in a particular context, because the agent or object in question is taken to have a certain "base property." She uses the example of a strike in baseball to illuminate this idea. To be a strike, for Ásta, is to be called a strike by the umpire; and this is something umpires do to balls they take to have the base property of traveling through the strike zone. But, unlike for someone like Searle, it is not the fact that the ball has traveled through the strike zone that makes it a strike; rather, it is the fact that the umpire *takes* it to have traveled through the strike zone. A "mistaken" call still functions to make the ball a strike. When it comes to *human* kinds, on Ásta's account, membership is conferred on agents when those around them confer a status on them, because of their presumed possession of the relevant base property. For many human kinds, though, which base property is being tracked by the conferral will be context-sensitive. So Ásta argues that one and the same person can be a woman in one context, but not a woman in another, because in the first context her peers take the relevant base property to be self-identification, and in the second they take the relevant base property to be secondary sex organs.

While Ásta's theory has an appealing context-sensitivity, and is developed precisely to grapple with the contested and in-flux nature of human kinds that we are trying to address, it will not do as the complement to a Searlean account of kind membership. That's because, if we plugged Ásta's account into criterion 3, an individual would only satisfy that criterion if those around her treated her as a member of the relevant human kind. In other words, on Ásta's account, others' failure to treat us as a member of a human kind (or more precisely, a *critical mass* of others failing to treat us as a member of a human kind) makes it the case that we are *not* a member of the human kind, at least in that context. The upshot of this would be that claims against having one's social dignity violated would become more self-defeating the more widespread those violations were. Others' denial that we are a member of a particular human kind would destroy our status dignity with respect to that human kind; and in virtue of it being destroyed, we would lack any claim against having it violated.

Another reason to refrain from supplementing the Searlean picture for institutionalized human kinds with a conferralist account for informal social kinds, is that there is no reason to think—and many reasons to doubt—that how membership is determined will generalize across informal human kinds, even at the level of abstraction given by Ásta. It may well be that a human kind like "celebrity" is conferred in just the way Ásta's account suggests (with the plausible implication that systematic denials of celebrity status render one not a celebrity, and hence no one ever has a valid dignitarian claim against such denials). But that does not mean that membership in gender kinds is conferred in this way; or that, however membership in gender kinds is established, it has anything much to do with how membership in race kinds is established.

Some human kinds may well be conferralist, in just the sense Ásta puts forward, while others may be closer to a Searlean account. Some human kinds might be imposed on us from the outside;[^21] others might simply require self-identification (Bettcher 2009); while others again might be deeply normative, such that to be a member of that kind is to meet the conditions that *ought* to hold, rather than the conditions that *do* hold (cf. Diaz-Leon 2016). Over and above these possible divergences, membership in distinct human kinds might also differ with respect to whether, and to what extent, they "travel" (that is, the extent to which to be a member in one social context carries over to other social contexts).[^22] So for some human kinds, an agent might only count as a member if they satisfy the membership conditions in the very context in which their membership is being called into question;[^23] while for other human kinds, it may be that meeting the membership conditions in one context suffices to ground a claim to membership in any context.[^24] If that's right, a complete analysis of criterion 3 would require determining the membership conditions for each and every human kind with respect to which a status dignity claim might be made—and that is obviously too large an undertaking to slot in here. As such, I leave criterion 3 as a placeholder, into which varying accounts of kind membership could be plugged.

To sum up where we've come to: I've argued that status dignity tracks membership in human kinds. If we are refused recognition of such membership, either by direct denial of our membership, or by not being treated in accordance with norms of respect for members, this constitutes a status dignity violation, and is a harm to both self-understanding and social standing. I then posited three criteria for assessing the validity of moral claims against having one's status dignity violated: first, upholding our claim must not perpetuate or exacerbate the oppression of others; second, the harm we are exposed to through the status dignity violation must be sufficiently substantial to justify holding others to be under an obligation to modify their behavior; and finally, the act in question must in fact *be* a status dignity violation, which means we must be a member of the human kind in question, and the norm by which we are demanding to be treated must actually apply to that human kind. I have noted that a full explication of criterion 3 is not possible here, because what it is to be a member of a human kind is likely to differ between kinds. That does not mean that criterion 3 is idle, however: just because there will be hard cases, it doesn't follow that there won't be any easy cases (I take my claim to be recognized as a princess to be one of these there are no plausible accounts of what it is to be a princess on which I would count). Moreover, even for the hard cases, criterion 3 helps us locate the source of disputes over status dignitarian claims.

There is one more aspect to status dignity violations that needs to be considered, before we move on to the frustration and destruction of status dignity. Throughout this book, I have been primarily focused on the ways in which the behavior of others threatens our dignity. This is not because we are incapable of threatening our own dignity—far from it—but rather because I am interested in whether and how dignity can underpin moral claims against others, and typically the ways in which our own voluntary behavior threatens our dignity is not relevant to that question. When it comes to *status* dignity, however, matters become more complicated. Two types of self-regarding case in particular warrant closer inspection. First, there are cases in which an individual invites others to violate her status dignity,

> Such pluralism could be modified by a normative criterion, whereby one's membership is determined by the context with the normatively superior criteria. See, e.g., (Bettcher 2013, Diaz-Leon 2016).

where this has implications for the status dignity of others who share a social identity with her; and second, there are cases in which an individual's demands to be treated with recognition respect require treating her in accordance with oppressive norms, again with troubling implications for those who share a social identity with her.

The first type of self-regarding case can be illuminated through an example that is in heavy rotation in the contemporary literature on dignity. Here is how Michael Rosen (2012, 63) describes the situation:

> In October 1995 the Conseil d'État (the court of highest instance for French administrative law) adjudicated a case brought by a M. Manuel Wackenheim against the commune of Morsang-sur-Orge. On October [^25], 1991, the Mayor of Morsang-sur-Orge had issued an order banning a dwarf-tossing competition due to take place at a local discotheque. M. Wackenheim, a dwarf, wearing a protective suit, was to be thrown by the competitors, landing on a suitably placed airbed.

As Rosen goes on to explain, Wackenheim appeals the Mayor's decision to prevent the dwarf-tossing event all the way to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations, where he was ultimately defeated. Throughout the legal battle, those opposed to the dwarf-tossing event made their case through appeal to the notion of dignity:

> [T]he court of appeal was of the opinion that the entertainment of "dwarf throwing," consisting of the throwing of a dwarf by members of the public, leads to using a person affected by a physical handicap and presented as such as a projectile. An attraction of this sort was regarded as infringing the dignity of the human person in its very objective.

(cited in Rosen 2012, 65)

I do not think the appeal to *human* dignity is particularly illuminating in this case, and instead examine it through the by now familiar lens of status dignity, and more precisely Wackenheim's dignity *qua* French citizen.25

As far as I am aware, French citizens are not in the habit of using one another as projectiles for entertainment. Even leaving aside the specifics of being used as a projectile, I hope we can assume there is a general norm amongst French citizens that they ought not treat one another as objects of ridicule on the basis of their physical appearance. Let's assume for argument's sake, then, that part of the recognition respect French citizens owe to one another is not to treat one another as objects of ridicule in this way. One way we can understand what Wackenheim is doing then, is as inviting others to violate his status dignity. The question now becomes whether he is morally entitled to do so.

I want to tentatively suggest that the answer to this question is no; but not because of any self-regarding obligation Wackenheim may have to himself.[^26] Rather, what we see here is the interaction between two salient social identities: Wackenheim is both a French citizen, and a dwarf. Crucially, Wackenheim's invitation to have his status dignity violated *depends upon* his identity as a dwarf. This has significant implications for other people with dwarfism. When we make claims explicitly *as* members of a particular human kind, we are shaping the social meaning of that human kind—and the effects of this are felt well beyond the immediate participants in that interaction. Wackenheim's attempts to participate in the dwarf-tossing competition carry the social meaning either that violating the status dignity of dwarves is permissible, or that dwarves are not full members of the human kinds for which there is a norm of not treating members as objects of ridicule. Either way, other dwarves who share a social world with Wackenheim have at the very least a *pro tanto* claim that he not threaten *their* status dignity in this way.

I noted above that my judgment of Wackenheim's case was going to be tentative, and this is because a full assessment would require a much more thorough examination of the facts of the case, as well as consideration of Wackenheim's competing claims to personal autonomy. My goal in discussing this case was not to show that my account of status dignity renders the moral problems the case raises simple, but rather to demonstrate that one individual's status dignity can be deeply entwined with the status dignity of those with whom she shares social identities. If an individual communicates to others in her social world that it is permissible to violate her status dignity *because* she is a woman, or gay, or Black, then she is simultaneously (even if inadvertently) communicating to others in her social world that it is permissible to violate the status dignity of *all* women, or *all* gay people, or *all* Black people. While her interest in free speech may arguably trump the interests of those who share the relevant social identity in safeguarding their status dignity, I hope to have at least shown that they *have* a relevant interest that ought to enter the moral calculus.

The second type of self-regarding case is equally fraught. It concerns situations in which members of oppressed kinds demand that others treat them in accordance with norms for that kind that perpetuate the oppression of others in the kind. Why might they do such a thing? One issue this examination of status dignity has hopefully brought to light is the way in which social norms and markers of respect are deeply interwoven. Not to be treated as is the norm for members of a particular human kind is often experienced as a mark of *dis*respect, and this is no less true when those norms attach to membership in an oppressed kind. In many societies there are norms concerning how women ought to be treated that are both considered markers of respect, and perpetuate the oppression of women. Consider norms such as opening the door for women; paying for a woman's drinks; even seeing her first and foremost as a sexual being. If women internalize these norms as part of the meaning of being a woman, then it is unsurprising that they sometimes experience their absence as disrespectful: it can feel like others are failing to see her *as* a woman. It is also unsurprising, then, that women sometimes demand to be treated in accordance with these norms. The account of status dignity I've offered can help make sense of these kinds of demands, because it draws attention to the very real harm women can experience if they are not treated *as* women—harms to their self-understanding, especially if being a woman forms a central part of their identity; and harms to their social standing, through having others invited to see them as somehow lesser or deviant *qua* woman. That said, my account also shows why these harms do not suffice to ground moral claims in such cases: to be treated in accordance with such norms perpetuates the oppression of other women, through reinforcing the social meaning of woman as weak, economically dependent, sexual objects. This does not mean, though, that as a society we should simply tolerate the kinds of harms illuminated here. When recognition respect becomes entangled with oppressive norms, as it so often does with gender, the path forward seems clear, in theory even if not in practice. We should do what we can to reconfigure the social meaning of woman—to evolve the human kind—so that one can be seen as a woman without simultaneously being seen as lesser.

## 3. Status Dignity Frustrations

To have one's status dignity frustrated is to be denied access to spaces in which recognition respect would be received. Status dignity frustrations are ubiquitous. Consider the academic context, in which an invitation to keynote a conference provides copious opportunities to be treated with recognition respect *qua* academic; the flip side of this is that every academic who's not invited to keynote has their status dignity *qua* academic frustrated, because they are being denied these opportunities. We cannot plausibly demand that our status dignity never be frustrated.

That said, status dignity frustrations can cause significant harm, and so while we may not owe it to one another to ensure status dignity is *never* frustrated, there are good reasons to attend to the ways in which patterns of dignity frustration can exacerbate oppression. When membership in a particular human kind is a pathway to important social goods, we need to attend to those individuals whose membership is not widely and publicly acknowledged, and hence whose membership in the kind is tenuous. This is especially so if the tenuousness of their membership is due to having an oppressed social identity. For example, being a woman involves systematic disadvantage—women face heightened threats and reduced opportunities across a range of domains. As such, to be a woman is to have an oppressed social identity. One pathway to counter and resist this oppression is through ensuring women are also seen as members of human kinds that carry social power—e.g. as citizens; lawyers; CEOs; etc. To be clear, it is not enough for women to *be* citizens, lawyers, CEOs, etc.: that identity also needs to be publicly affirmed, which means women need to have access to the spaces in which they can be interacted with *as* citizens, lawyers, CEOs, etc. Demonstrations of recognition respect reaffirm women's belonging in these human kinds, and hence their entitlement to various forms of respectful treatment, which can go at least some way to unsettling some of the oppressive norms that attach to them *qua* women. As a society, then, we have an obligation to secure the status dignity of members of oppressed groups, which entails taking measures to ensure their status dignity is not systematically frustrated. This will involve ensuring they have access to spaces in which they can be publicly engaged with as members of privileged human kinds.

There is one further way in which status dignity can be frustrated that is worth attending to. So far, I've considered frustration of status dignity as involving denial of opportunities to receive the recognition to which someone is entitled, in virtue of their membership in a particular human kind. It is also possible to have one's status dignity frustrated if the recognized human kinds in some domain leave no room for someone like you (cf. Dembroff forthcoming). To put it another way, respectful social interactions often involve responding to people as members of either this or that social kind. Social interactions involving gender often have this characteristic. In attempting to treat people with recognition respect, it is common to first ascertain their gender, so that they can be addressed with the corresponding title—"sir" or "ma'am" in the American South, "signore" or "signora" in Italy, and so on. To misgender someone, then, would be to violate their status dignity. However, if someone's gender does not fit into the pre-existing socially recognized gender categories, we may lack the resources to address them with recognition respect, especially in highly scripted interactions. Take a concierge at a hotel in New Orleans, addressing each customer in turn as "sir" or "ma'am" to express her respect. When she comes to someone who does not fit within the gender binary, the social scripts on which she relies will be blank.[^27] If she responds by avoiding the social interaction altogether, she will be frustrating the guest's status dignity by denying them the opportunity for receiving the recognition respect all other guests are receiving; if she misgenders the guest in an attempt to be respectful, she will be violating their status dignity.[^28]

I have claimed that we do not each have a moral claim against having our status dignity frustrated. Such frustrations are an inevitable consequence of social life, since we cannot all occupy the positions that provide maximal opportunities for receiving recognition respect. However, both kinds of status dignity frustration discussed above suggest that there is a different moral claim in the area: a claim to a social environment in which one's status dignity is not *systematically* frustrated, in ways that exacerbate existing oppression. This means ensuring individuals with oppressed social identities are prioritized in the allocation of positions that ensure regular public affirmation of their membership in privileged kinds; and ensuring our existing social kinds, and their respective modes of recognition respect, do not create situations in which people lack the hermeneutical resources to interact with one another respectfully.

## 4. Destruction of Status Dignity

To destroy someone's status dignity is to expel her from a human kind. Typically, someone's status dignity will only be destroyed relative to one particular human kind (as a Catholic, say, or as a US citizen). Nonetheless, the effects of status dignity destruction can be significant. If someone's selfunderstanding is built around membership in a particular human kind, then expulsion from that kind can precipitate an identity crisis. Moreover, being expelled from a human kind sends a very public message that the individual in question is unworthy or deviant. The ramifications of this message can extend well beyond the immediate loss of membership, weakening the force of broader prohibitions on harming them. This is especially so when one's excommunication is publicly broadcast. Lisa Guenther (2013, 61) puts the point well:

> When humiliation is accomplished by marking someone's body, clothing, or dwelling, it stamps one with a visible and more or less permanent sign of this isolated, expelled identity, leaving no avenues of escape or return, no possibilities for becoming otherwise. The scarlet letter, the tattoo, the yellow star – all attest to an identification of the subject with his or her isolated fault. You are an adulteress, a criminal, a Jew: frozen in time, fixed in a position on the margins of social life where everyone can see you but no one will hear you, where you can neither leave nor stay, condemned to a living death.

Importantly, these harms to both self-understanding and social standing occur in virtue of *attempts* at expulsion, even if those attempts ultimately fail. Whether or not we have status dignity—that is, whether or not we are actually a member of a given human kind—depends on whether we are in fact members of that kind. At least for some social kinds, it does not suffice for powerful members of that kind to simply declare that we are no longer members; provided we still meet the membership criteria, whatever these turn out to be, then we remain members no matter what other people say or think. The harms in attempts at expulsion, then, mirror those for status dignity violations; and they do so because they involve the very same structure of presenting someone as unworthy of membership.

That said, there are ways in which status dignity can be intentionally destroyed. For some human kinds, who is a member *can* depend on the judgments of a specified authority; if that authority declares you to no longer be a member, then according to the criteria of membership you cease to be a member. We see this most clearly in institutionalized human kinds, such as various religions, which reserve the right to excommunicate members who violate their codes.[^29] A further way in which status dignity can be intentionally destroyed is if the criteria of membership are reconfigured, in a deliberate attempt to expel and exclude certain kinds of people. Current movements in the US pushing for a change to birthright citizenship have this structure: they are attempts to change the rules about who counts as a member of the human kind "US citizen," in order to reduce the percentage of citizens who are non-white.

Destruction of status dignity can precipitate immense harms to selfunderstanding and social standing. Nonetheless, we are not necessarily entitled to the protection of our status dignity—at least not without additional factors being brought into the calculus. If individuals had a general claim against the destruction of their status dignity, this would entail an obligation on the part of groups to retain individuals as members, irrespective of what they do. However, as we saw above, an individual's self-understanding is affected by her social context. An important implication of this is that who counts as a member of the human kinds with which someone identifies will shape how she comes to understand herself. Consider the case of a relatively closed religious community such as the Amish, and imagine an individual who demands continued recognition as a member, despite admitting to now being an atheist. For the Amish to accede to such a demand would be to disrupt the identity of those members who see their identity as defined precisely through a shared belief in God. They would lose a central way of understanding what it means to be Amish, and hence of who they are.[^30] For a religious community to continue viewing someone as a member after that person declares their rejection of the religion's God would erode the meaning of membership in a community of faith. Not to expel someone whose continued membership would distort the social meaning of being a member would be to impose a harm on all other members.

It is important to stress, however, that even for kinds from which expulsion or alienation is possible, there may nonetheless be additional reasons for which the expelled person is entitled to forms of treatment associated with membership. One way we can continue to be entitled to a certain form of recognition respect, despite our expulsion from a human kind, is if that form of recognition respect mirrors an independent moral entitlement. To put it another way: a single type of treatment may be demanded *both* because it constitutes a form of recognition respect for a particular human kind, *and* because we have a moral right to it grounded in some naturalistic feature or capacity. Losing the claim to recognition respect does not remove the broader moral claim. A second way we can continue to be entitled to a certain form of recognition respect, despite our expulsion from a human kind, is if that form of recognition respect is commanded in virtue of multiple human kinds. Imagine that Chad abandons his studies. While no longer being a student removes one ground for his demand to be called by his name, the norm of calling someone by their name constitutes a form of recognition respect across a wide variety of human kinds. He can thus continue to demand this form of respect, on the grounds of other forms of status dignity.

I have suggested that it is, at least sometimes, morally permissible to expel someone from a human kind, and hence to destroy her status dignity with respect to that kind. There are, though, important exceptions to this claim. Sometimes, membership in a particular human kind offers a necessary protection against serious harms, such that it would be immoral to deny someone membership. Citizenship often has this character, especially if the individual in question does not have dual citizenship in another safe country.[^31] More importantly, *the human itself* has this character. As I will argue in Chapter 5, to have human dignity is to be a member of the social kind "human." As with all social kinds, though, who gets to be a member, what it means to be a member, and what we are entitled to *qua* member, is up to us. This means that the prospect of expulsion from the human is an everpresent threat, with potentially catastrophic consequences. It is to that issue that we now turn.

[^1]: Part of what's going on in such cases may well be that the derogatory identity-based norms to which someone is subject *qua* woman, or *qua* Black person, clash with the respectful norms of treatment one commands *qua* doctor or CEO—and those around us take the identity-based norms to trump the norms attached to our occupational status. Such clashes are not without emancipatory potential, however. As Moira Gatens has observed,<blockquote> Competition between different [norms] inevitably generates contradictions over time. For example, in emerging modern liberal societies, there was an acute contradiction between norms of marriage and norms of citizenship that may be traced to conflicting religious and political imaginaries. Are wives rightly subject to their husbands? If so, how can women become genuine citizens, that is, how can a subjected identity (wife) relate to other citizens as an equal? Such contradictions may be experienced as confusing and painful but may end up undermining the force of the norm of a wife's obedience to her husband. (2004, 287) </blockquote> Thanks to Louise Richardson-Self for helpful discussion on this issue.
[^2]: I borrow the term "human kind" from (Hacking 1999). It's important to note that the term "human kind" is sometimes used in a different way, to mean artefacts constructed through human activity. See, e.g., (Thomasson 2003).

[^6]: There is a separate issue in the area, which is important but not directly relevant to my purposes here; namely, whether, when, and how we could be morally obligated to uphold norms of behavior for members of a human kind, simply in virtue of being a member of that human kind (whether academics have special responsibilities *qua* academics, say). Insofar as that issue is relevant to dignity, it is going to fall under the banner of *social* dignity, since failure to act as one is expected to act is likely to elicit appraisal disrespect. For a discussion of how such expectations interact with gender identity, see (Butler 1990, Ásta 2011).

[^8]: I've deliberately chosen a name here that is associated with maleness and whiteness, to avoid pushing intuitions around through the suggestion of discrimination on the basis of protected categories. While acts of discrimination will typically also be dignity violations, they also constitute many other kinds of moral wrong, and so are not as useful in illuminating the distinctive status dignitarian harms I'm trying to identify here.
[^9]: It is broadly accepted within anthropology that kinship is socially constructed, with different communities having different kinship roles, and different criteria for who occupies those roles. As Marshall Sahlins (2013, 2) puts the point:<blockquote> It seems fair to say that the current anthropological orthodoxy in kinship studies can be summed up in the proposition that any relationship constituted in terms of procreation, filiation, or descent can also be made postnatally or performatively by culturally appropriate action. Whatever is construed genealogically may also be constructed socially: an affirmation that can be demonstrated across the known range of societies [. . .].</blockquote> For more on the social construction of kinship relations, see (Carsten 2004, esp Ch 1, Galvin 2001).
[^10]: As we saw in Chapter 3, it might be tempting at this point to restrict the scope of the term "dignity violation," reserving it for cases in which the failure to respect constitutes a moral wrong. The substance of my argument would not be affected by such a terminological amendment, so readers who prefer that approach are welcome to make the relevant terminological substitutions. As noted earlier, though, I prefer to keep the term "dignity violation" tracking the *harm* such violations bring about, which is independent of the moral question. This preference is entirely pragmatic: if "dignity violation" were a moralized term, it would be too tempting to focus only on clear cases of moral wrongdoing, thus avoiding the difficult question of exactly when and why a failure to accord someone recognition respect constitutes a moral wrong.
[^11]: To be clear: the puzzle is not why social categories are morally relevant (none of us, I hope, would dispute the idea that race or gender have moral import, given the world we live in). Rather, the puzzle is about the moral force of social categories per se: why adoptive parents are morally entitled to be seen *as* parents, and treated accordingly, while white people lack a moral entitlement to be treated in accordance with racialized social norms.
[^12]: Different theories of legitimate expectation cash this out in different ways. For instance, Jeremy Bentham (1843) thinks that expectations are legitimate if they are based in law, as opposed to social custom, while Allen Buchanan (1975) holds that expectations are only legitimate if they arise from just institutions. For a good survey of theories of legitimate expectations, see (Brown 2017).
[^13]: Charlotte Witt (2011) offers a very strong version of this claim with respect to gender: "gender is a pervasive and fundamental social position that unifies and determines all other social positions both synchronically and diachronically. It unifies them not physically, but by providing a principle of normative unity. It is as a woman that I am a parent or a professor (or whatever the full range of my social roles might be at the moment or over time)" (p. 20). We don't need to follow Witt all the way here to accept that membership in some social kinds will figure more centrally in our self-understanding than others.
[^14]: For a good discussion of the social meaning of exclusion, see (Sangiovanni 2017, 123). Sangiovanni is primarily interested in the harm of *discrimination*. On my account, discrimination will always constitute a status dignity violation, since it involves the refusal to treat an individual as they are entitled to be treated. However, not all status dignity violations involve discrimination. While status dignity violations necessarily involve discrimination in the literal sense that an individual is picked out and treated differently, this individuation need not map onto any socially salient characteristic, which I take to be a necessary component of discrimination. We see this with the example of Roll Call. If Chad is picked out because of his race, or sexuality, or so on, then it is appropriate to consider his treatment discrimination. If Chad has no socially stigmatized identities, and the treatment he receives is simply the result of personal animosity, it is not productive to think of it is a case of discrimination, though his status dignity is violated all the same.

[^16]: In many cases of status dignity violations, agents will face additional harms to those identified here. For instance, if a trans woman is refused access to women's bathrooms, this constitutes a status dignity violation, on my account. As is often pointed out, though, one of the most immediate harms threatened by such exclusions is physical: trans women face a higher risk of assault if they are required to use men's bathrooms. Such harms should of course be taken into account in assessing the reasons for having more inclusive policies around bathroom usage. My focus here, though, is on the harms that are intrinsic to status dignity violations. In a fuller assessment of what we owe to one another, consideration of these harms would have to be supplemented with attention to additional harms arising in specific cases.
[^17]: It does not follow that we ought to refuse to recognize the broader salience of the category "white," even in a context such as Apartheid South Africa. This is because others can legitimately make claims on us based on our whiteness—see, e.g., (Alcoff 1998).
[^18]: There are exceptions that are worth noting here, though. Consider the kind "man," which I'll just assume for the sake of argument functions as an oppressive kind. If we held that *all* claims to be recognized as a member of an oppressive kind are perpetuations of oppression, it would follow that upholding *any* man's claim to be recognized as a man would fail criterion 1, and hence be invalid. This generalization is too strong—there are cases in which a particular man's demand for recognition functions, in context, to subvert oppressive features of the kind, rather than maintain them, and hence satisfies criterion 1. For example, if someone's manhood is questioned because he is engaged in stereotypically feminine activities, then his demand to be seen as a man works to *reduce*, rather than reproduce, the oppressiveness of the kind. Similarly, a trans man's demand to be recognized as a man could function to subvert, or at least soften, the gender binary, and hence could avoid being oppressive.
[^19]: Robin Dembroff (forthcoming) has argued that our obligations to treat people as members of human kinds can come apart from their actual membership in those human kinds. This is because the membership criteria operative in our society might be oppressively exclusionary, and we would be amplifying that oppression by using those criteria as defeaters. I'm sympathetic to this worry, but I think it can be addressed. In the context of gender, which is Dembroff 's focus here, I think we do better to say that trans people *just are* members of the relevant kinds, which we can do by adopting either a normative or a pluralistic account of membership in gender kinds. For other human kinds, I think we can trace the oppression of existing criteria to their incompatibility with status dignitarian norms for a higher order human kind. That is, we can be a member of one human kind for which norms of treatment include recognition as a member of another human kind. For instance, in virtue of being an adult citizen, we are entitled to be recognized as a member of the kind "eligible voter." In cases like this, we are still appealing to actual membership in human kinds to explain the validity of the demand to be seen as a member; it's just that it's the higher order kind doing the work, rather than the kind from which the individual is being excluded.
[^20]: Talia Mae Bettcher (2013) may object to this way of framing the issue. She writes: "Consider the question (among some non-trans feminists) whether trans women do or do not count as women. In raising such a question, trans women are viewed as difficult cases with respect to the category 'woman'. In this way, the inclusion of trans women in the category 'woman' is something in need of defense (unlike the taken-for-granted inclusion of non-trans women)." I agree with Bettcher that to be adequate, an account of "woman" must take as a starting point that trans women are women. My claim here is meant to be a descriptive one, i.e. that many people deny trans women are women, and hence to support trans women's claim to be recognized as women we need some account of what it is to be a woman.
[^21]: See, e.g., (Haslanger 2012, 234): "S is a woman iff <br> - (i) S is regularly and for the most part observed or imagined to have certain bodily features presumed to be evidence of a female's biological role in reproduction;<br> - (ii) that S has these features marks S within the dominant ideology of S's society as someone who ought to occupy certain kinds of social position that are in fact subordinate (and so motivates and justifies S's occupying such a position); and <br> - (iii) the fact that S satisfies (i) and (ii) plays a role in S's systematic subordination, that is, along some dimension, S's social position is oppressive, and S's satisfying (i) and (ii) plays a role in that dimension of subordination."
[^22]: For discussion, see (Glasgow 2007, Ludwig 2018).
[^23]: Joshua Glasgow (2007) describes this as "ontological localism," which in the context of race "holds that when one moves between different communities, not only can one's *classification* change when those communities have different racial concepts, but one's *race* can actually change." For discussion of a semantic version of this metaphysical claim, see (Saul 2012).
[^24]: Cf. Robin Dembroff (forthcoming). As they put the point, "Pluralism about operative gender kinds is compatible with the claim that a trans man's identity is veridical in all contexts. And this means it is compatible with the idea that when he says, 'I am a man,' he picks out a true proposition regardless of the context of utterance" (pp. 17–18).
[^25]: This is presumably a case in which many instantiations of status dignity will share the relevant norms, and so focusing on his identity as a French citizen is admittedly somewhat arbitrary. Nonetheless, it provides a useful framework through which to explore the case.
[^26]: It's not that I don't think such a self-regarding argument could be made; rather, I hope to show that the potential wrongness of Wackenheim's participation in the dwarf-throwing competition does not depend on such self-regarding duties.
[^27]: One way to think about this situation is as an instance of what Miranda Fricker calls *hermeneutical injustice*, whereby injustice consists in the absence of conceptual resources for understanding one's situation (Fricker 2007, esp. Ch 7).
[^28]: This is not to say that avoidance is always undesirable. As Judith Butler points out, "if my options are loathsome, if I have no desire to be recognized within a certain set of norms, then it follows that my sense of survival depends upon escaping the clutch of those norms by which recognition is conferred" (Butler 2004, 3).
[^29]: An implication of this is that we can also intentionally destroy our own status dignity, by deliberately violating rules of membership that we know will get us expelled. In other words, we can "opt out" of human kinds whose membership requires our ongoing adherence to certain rules. While such decisions can have significant ramifications for an individual's self-understanding, they are not my focus here.
[^30]: I develop this claim in more depth, along with its implications for group-differentiated rights, in (Killmister 2011).
