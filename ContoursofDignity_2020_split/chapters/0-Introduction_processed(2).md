# Introduction

## 1. Setting the Scene

Dignity occupies a complicated position in our moral lives. This is due in no small part to the widely varied uses to which the concept is put, as the following passage from Jean Améry (1980) demonstrates.

Not much is said when someone who has never been beaten makes the ethical and pathetic statement that upon the first blow the prisoner loses his human dignity. I must confess that I don't know exactly what that is: human dignity. One person thinks he loses it when he finds himself in circumstances that make it impossible for him to take a daily bath. Another believes he loses it when he must speak to an official in something other than his native language. In one instance human dignity is bound to a certain physical convenience, in the other to the right of free speech, in still another perhaps to the availability of erotic partners of the same sex. (pp. 27–8)

Dignity, it seems, is the kind of thing that can be threatened by factors as diverse as physical violence, unmet standards of decorum, and colonial power relations. What kind of feature could possibly fit this description?

Things get even more difficult if we move beyond Améry's observation, and note that one of the most common contemporary invocations of dignity connects it to human rights. We see this most strikingly in the preamble to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (United Nations 1948), which declares that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world." Here, dignity is appealed to as a foundational and awe-inspiring value, signifying nothing less than the inalienable moral worth of all persons.

This points to a tension at the heart of the concept of dignity: on the one hand, dignity is often taken to be an inalienable and immutable feature of persons, occupying a role somewhat akin to the soul in religious discourse; but on the other hand, it is just as often taken to be a precious but inherently fragile property of persons, whose loss causes them a grave harm. Améry himself uses the language of dignity in the latter way, in describing the import of Nazi Germany's Nuremberg laws: "The death threat, which I felt for the first time with complete clarity while reading the Nuremberg Laws, included what is commonly referred to as the methodic 'degradation' of the Jews by the Nazis. Formulated differently: the denial of human dignity sounded the death threat" (1980, 86). Here dignity does not underpin human rights in the sense meant by the UDHR, whereby our inalienable dignity provides the foundation for our inalienable human rights. Rather, human dignity can be *lost*, and when it is, we lose all security in the world. Echoes of this vulnerability recur in a wide variety of contexts. Describing the aftermath of his torture at the hands of American soldiers in Abu Ghraib, for instance, Mr al-Rawi reported: "I feel I lost my dignity. . .I couldn't even raise my head in my house when I went home" (cited in McCarthy 2004). In a strikingly similar tone, though in very different circumstances, Don Berwick, in defense of patient-centered care in medical ethics, writes, "What chills my bones is indignity. . . .It is the image of myself in a hospital gown, homogenized, anonymous, powerless, no longer myself " (Berwick 2009, 564). How, though, can dignity be both a quality that can be lost through torture or hospitalization, and also function as an inalienable foundation of human rights?

Complicating matters even further, dignity seems capable of moving freely from the profoundest of moral claims to the heights of mundanity. For instance, here's how the Finnish newspaper YLE News described Finland's upcoming centenary celebrations: "Finland's government has announced its plans for events to celebrate the country's 100th Independence Day on December 6th this year. Official descriptions of the plans indicate that they will be filled with joy, dignity—and karaoke."[^1] And then there's this comment from Mike Tanier, after Broncos coach John Enver called his team "a little bit soft" following a loss: "['soft' is] total codswallop, the kind of thing angry fans snarl at sports talk hosts after losses, a term that should be *beneath the dignity* of a team president" (Tanier 2017, emphasis added).

It can be very difficult to make sense of what ties together these varied usages of the term dignity, ranging as they do from the very foundation of human rights through to the expected behavior of sports coaches. It is in large part for these reason that some philosophers have declared dignity a "useless concept," one that we should purge from our moral vocabulary.[^2]

In light of such difficulties, the ambition to develop a theory of dignity, as I do in this book, may seem misguided. It is thus important to be clear up front about the scope of my ambition. I make no claim here to be offering "the" definitive theory of dignity. The term carries too much baggage for that to be a feasible project. Instead, what I am offering is a way of thinking about dignity that I take to be philosophically useful. More precisely, I develop a theory with an eye to capturing the key uses to which the concept of dignity is put in our moral lives, such as those identified in the opening paragraphs of this chapter. Much turns here, as well, on just how unified we want our theory of dignity to be. On the theory I develop here, dignity cannot be reduced to one core set of necessary and sufficient conditions. Rather, dignity is more like a tapestry, comprising several distinct but complementary interwoven strands. As with all tapestries, decisions have to be made about what to include. Without a doubt, another philosopher could identify different strands of dignity, and weave them together into an equally coherent theory.[^3] To reiterate: I make no claims here to be offering either an exhaustive or a definitive theory. My hope is only to develop a theory of dignity that is useful, insofar as it resonates with, and helps us reflect upon, our moral lives.[^4] As Tamler Sommers (2018) notes, in writing about the closely related concept of honor, "no simple theory can capture something as chaotic and contradictory as human nature or human society. The more abstract and simple the theory, the less it can tell us about our actual lives and struggles." If we want a concept of dignity that can illuminate the complexity of human life, we need to be willing to move beyond the rarefied air of inherent moral worth, and grapple with the muck and the mire; be willing, that is, to attend to people in their weakest moments, and their deepest shame.

One implication of the way I am approaching this project is worth noting up front, which is that the negative work will be minimal. While I will sketch what I take to be problems with some competing theories of dignity, this is done primarily to motivate readers to take seriously the new theory I'm developing. I do not purport to be offering decisive objections to those competitors. Since I don't think there's a truth of the matter—the "one true theory of dignity" out there waiting to be uncovered—the best I can hope to do is paint a compelling picture of how dignity might be understood, and demonstrate the important moral work that can be done if we take that picture as our starting point, rather than remaining bound to a more standard conception of dignity.

A second implication of the way I am approaching this project, which it is also important to be upfront about at the outset, is that my goal is to explore the meaning and import of dignity, rather than to develop a comprehensive dignitarian moral or political theory; that is, a moral or political theory which places dignity at its core.[^5] While such projects are undoubtedly immensely valuable, they have two limitations which motivate me to take a different path. First, placing dignity at the center of a moral or political theory will inevitably constrain how richly dignity can be conceived. In particular, it will make it difficult to accommodate the morally dubious aspects of dignity, especially the ways in which it is wrapped up in problematically hierarchical social relations, which I think it is important not to obscure. Second, a full moral or political theory would have to take a side in various long-standing and controversial philosophical debates about the meaning of justice, the source of moral value, and so on. Avoiding such controversies, where possible, opens up the prospect of a theory of dignity that can inform a much wider array of philosophical projects.

Enough of the caveats: here's how the book will unfold. Once the preliminaries are out of the way, Chapter 1 will lay out the theory of dignity that informs the remainder of the book. I propose three interweaving strands of dignity: personal, social, and status. To anticipate: personal dignity centers upon the standards agents hold themselves to; social dignity centers upon the standards communities hold their members to; and status dignity centers upon the communities' standards for how members are to be treated. Chapter 1 will explicate these three strands, drawing out their similarities and differences. With the theoretical framework in place, the remainder of the book will motivate this approach to dignity by showing how it can help us think about difficult and important moral issues. Chapter 2 explores the various ways in which our dignity can be said to be fragile, and in particular how it can be violated, how it can be frustrated, and how it can be destroyed. Chapters 3 and 4 build on this analysis to examine how we are harmed when our personal, social, or status dignity is damaged, and the scope of moral claims against having each of these strands of dignity damaged. Chapter 5 then tackles the meaning and import of *human* dignity, which I take to be a particular instantiation of status dignity.

That's where we're heading. First, though, I need to lay out some groundwork. Thus far I've pointed to the various ways in which dignity is understood in popular usage. It will be helpful, though, to also sketch the various ways in which philosophers have understood dignity.[^6] As we'll see, each of these philosophical conceptions of dignity does some of the moral work dignity is called upon to do in popular usage. Elements of each of these conceptions, accordingly, will need to make their way into the resulting theory of dignity. I will simplify this requirement by focusing on three key desiderata: to fulfill its promise, a theory of dignity ought to be able to explain the connection between dignity and *respect*; it ought to be able to explain why some people are *more dignified* than others; and it ought to be able to explain the possibility and import of dignity's *fragility*.

Importantly, while I seek to accommodate all the important moral work dignity is called upon to do, I do not seek to accommodate every aspect of extant philosophical conceptions of dignity. In particular, I reject a very common philosophical conception of dignity: what Michael Rosen (2012, 9) calls dignity as an "inner transcendental kernel," i.e. something intrinsic to human beings, which gives us inestimable worth and justifies our moral claims. There are three interrelated reasons for this rejection, which I explain in more detail in Chapter 1. First, appeal to such an intrinsic feature of persons is unnecessary: the same moral work can be done when dignity is understood as conferred. Second, appeal to such an intrinsic feature is philosophically suspect: it will either reduce to another feature, such as rationality, rendering the appeal to dignity redundant, or it will depend on normatively mysterious properties such as shared humanity, rendering the appeal to dignity unsuccessful. Finally, attempts to ground moral worth in an "inner kernel" tend to have an important and pernicious consequence: they deny dignity to the most vulnerable members of our community, especially individuals with profound cognitive impairments.

## 2. Conceptions of Dignity

Michael Rosen, in his illuminating book *Dignity* (2012), identifies four distinct conceptions of dignity at play in philosophical and legal discourse: i) dignity as inner worth; ii) dignity as elevated status; iii) dignity as admirable quality; and iv) dignity as respectful treatment.[^7] These conceptions will form the basis of my approach: my goal is to extract the components of each feature capable of doing the moral work dignity is typically called upon to do, and then weave these into a theory of dignity, while leaving aside the elements that are either redundant or counterproductive.

### 2.1 Dignity as Inner Worth

The first conception to consider is arguably the most common within philosophical circles, and it incorporates the "inner transcendental kernel" conception noted above.[^8] To have dignity, on this understanding, is to have an inestimable inner worth, which grounds our standing to make moral claims. The figure most prominently associated with such a view was, of course, Immanuel Kant, especially his *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (1976). As Kant is typically read in that work, dignity refers to a worth above all price, which is held only insofar as the thing in question is not a means to a further end, but rather an end in itself. Dignity is then identified with autonomy: only the moral law has a worth above all price, and thus only human beings have dignity, insofar as we alone have the capacity to respect the moral law, which we do through the exercise of our moral autonomy.

This is not the place to delve into deep exegesis of Kant's moral philosophy (nor am I the philosopher to do so!). Contemporary understandings of dignity—even those which construe it in terms of inner worth—have drifted a very long way from Kant's original view.[^9] Nonetheless, his impact is still felt, albeit not necessarily in ways of which Kant himself would approve. Rosen notes two key features of Kant's work on dignity that have left a deep imprint, and thus are worth highlighting. First is Kant's restriction of dignity to human beings. As Rosen points out,

> The influence of Kant has helped make it natural for people now to assume that all dignity in the full sense of the word has to be human dignity. But before Kant this was not so—and nor was it so in the Catholic tradition after Kant. Kant's conception of dignity makes an exception of human beings from the rest of creation (2012, 24).

Kant thus precipitated a shift in thinking that helped pave the way to contemporary popular understandings of human rights: we have human rights because we have dignity, and only humans have human rights because only humans have dignity.[^10]

The second feature is Kant's identification of dignity with autonomy. For Kant, autonomy is the capacity through which we recognize and respond to the moral law. As such, our dignity is grounded in our autonomy. We see echoes of this Kantian claim in the work of Stephen Darwall (2006), who connects our human dignity to our capacity to take up the second-personal standpoint. We also see a less moralized version of this claim in the work of James Griffin (2008), who argues that we have human rights because we have human dignity, where human dignity amounts to agency. The Kantian conception of dignity we have inherited, then, is one in which human beings have dignity in virtue of a special capacity that only humans possess, and this dignity commands an especially elevated form of respect.

The Kantian is not the only way of explicating the idea of dignity as inner worth, however. Also important is the Judeo-Christian tradition, according to which we have dignity because we have been created in the image of God.[^11] On this understanding, it's worth noting, dignity is unearned: humans do not need to have any particular features or capacities to have dignity. Simply being human suffices. (To anticipate where things are going: I take this implication of the Judeo-Christian conception of dignity to be a highly appealing one, and I will be trying to replicate it in my own theory, albeit without the theological commitments.)

Dignity as inner worth most closely aligns with the popular idea that we have human rights because we have dignity. Dignity is what makes us special, what sets us apart from other animals, and what justifies our claims to have our needs met. Dignity is put to work in this way by both philosophers and practitioners of human rights. James Griffin is one of the most prominent philosophers who argues that we have human rights because we have dignity. Griffin equates dignity with the capacity for agency. His argument basically goes as follows: the purpose of human rights is to protect dignity; to have dignity is to have the capacity for agency; so the purpose of human rights is to protect agency. Another philosopher who grounds human rights in dignity is Pablo Gilabert. With a less Kantian inflection than Griffin, Gilabert argues that we have human rights because we have what he calls *status-dignity*, which is "a normative status that people have in virtue of some relatively general and constant valuable features...such as those regarding sentience, autonomous choice, prudential and moral reasoning, solidaristic cooperation, and engagement in productive activities" (Gilabert 2015, 180–1). The purpose of human rights, for Gilabert, is to enable our *condition-dignity*, which is the dignified state we are in when our human rights are secured. In other words, we are entitled to condition-dignity, insofar as we have status-dignity.[^12] Similar claims are made in various United Nations Declarations and Treaties, albeit without explicit argumentation. For instance, both the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Covenant on Social and Economic Rights, "recognize . . .that these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person" (United Nations 1966a, b).

Given the centrality of dignity to human rights discourse, I take it to be a central challenge for any theory of dignity to show how dignity could underpin human rights. I will undertake this challenge in Chapter 5. While I accept this role for dignity, though, I reject the way in which it is typically discharged. That is, I reject the idea, implicit in much of the work on dignity and human rights, that the only way for dignity to provide a foundation for human rights is by positing it as an "inner transcendental kernel."[^13]

### 2.2 Dignity as Elevated Status

The next conception of dignity to consider draws on the word's etymological connection to the Latin *dignitas*. As Miriam Griffin explains:

> *Dignitas* is an attribute signifying a certain standing or rank in the community; it rests on a particular office or status, and on the prestige that accrues to its holder. . . .It is an outward-looking quality, in that it depends on the view taken of one by others. (Griffin 2017, 50)

Jeremy Waldron's (2012) is perhaps the best known such account. According to Waldron, dignity can be understood as a quasi-legal status held by all persons, which is constituted by a cluster of rights and norms of respectful treatment. Our contemporary conception of dignity, he claims, has seen a "levelling up" compared to its historical counterpart. As Waldron famously summarizes his theory:

> Every man a duke, every woman a queen, everyone entitled to the sort of deference and consideration, everyone's person and body sacrosanct, in the way that nobles were entitled to deference or in the way that an assault upon the body or the person of a king was regarded as a sacrilege. <br> (pp. 73–4)

According to Waldron, then, what it currently means to say all persons have dignity is that we all command the rights and respect previously held by the elite few.

A similar, though more explicitly Hegelian, version of the elevated status conception of dignity is developed by Jay Bernstein (2015). Drawing extensively on Jean Améry's account of his torture and imprisonment at the hands of Nazi Germany, Bernstein argues that "our standing and worth [is] accomplished through the ascription to us of rights and entitlements." Our moral and legal practices, he continues,

> *give* persons the equivalent of intrinsic value by providing a *standing* or *status* for themselves and others that gives maximal weight to their life as valuable. . . .[T]he individual person is thereby constituted as an object whose human dignity is deserving of general respect. (p. 138)

Unlike Waldron, Bernstein sees dignity at least partially in terms of inner worth; however, he is at pains to stress that this "inner worth" is something we gain through the recognition accorded us by others.

There are three important features of the elevated status conception that I will be carrying over into my own theory. First, on this conception dignity is something that is *conferred*, rather than something that is inherent to persons. As such, it avoids the pernicious conclusion implied by many intrinsic worth conceptions, namely that some human beings lack the necessary capacities and hence do not have dignity. Second, though this is not something that is explored by either Waldron or Bernstein, conceiving dignity as elevated status allows that dignity might have multiple instantiations, according to the various social statuses an individual might hold. While Waldron and Bernstein both focus on our status as *persons*, and hence our *human* dignity, it is compatible with the elevated status conception that our familial, professional, or national statuses might carry with them diverse forms of dignity.[^14] Incorporating this diversity will allow dignity to do additional moral work: it explains how dignity can function as a context-sensitive standard against which we're measured, for one, and it can also explain how the content of the demand to respect a person's dignity can vary (what it takes to respect the dignity of a judge will be different from what it takes to respect the dignity of a nun, for example). Finally, dignity as elevated status has the resources to explain how an individual's dignity can be taken from her. Since dignity is conferred, on this conception, it can be revoked. For Bernstein, the paradigmatic ways in which dignity can be revoked are torture and rape. As he puts it:

> [R]ape and torture are relations whose very dynamic requires the transformation of the relationship as a fully human one into something else: a relation between human and sub-human, say; they are relations whose terms require that the victim be shown that her standing as human is insupportable and unsustainable. (p. 171)

While I disagree with the tight connection that Bernstein draws between torture and rape on the one hand, and loss of dignity on the other, the possibility that dignity can be lost forms a crucial plank in my own theory of dignity.

### 2.3 Dignity as Admirable Quality

The third conception of dignity focuses on what it means to *be dignified*, thus appealing to a variable quality of persons: some have it, and some manifestly do not (Brennan and Lo 2007, Hursthouse 2007, Kolnai 1976, Maroth 2014, Schroeder 2008). Aurel Kolnai offers perhaps the most comprehensive list of what it takes to qualify as dignified:

> First—the qualities of composure, calmness, restraint, reserve, and emotions or passions subdued and securely controlled without being negated or dissolved (verhaltene Leidenschaft in German). Secondly—the qualities of distinctness, delimitation, and distance; of something that conveys the idea of being intangible, invulnerable, inaccessible to destructive or corruptive or subversive interference. Dignity is thus comparable, metaphorically, to something like 'tempered steel'. Thirdly, in consonance therewith, Dignity also tends to connote the features of self-contained serenity, of a certain inward and toned-down but yet translucent and perceptible power of self-assertion: the dignified type of character is chary of emphatic activity rather than sullenly passive, perhaps impassive rather than impassible, patient rather than anxiously defensive, and devoid but not incapable of aggressiveness. (1976, 253–4)[^15]

Doris Schroeder (2008, 234) offers a more succinct definition of what she calls "comportment dignity": "Dignity is the outwardly displayed quality of a human being who acts in accordance with society's expectations of wellmannered demeanor and bearing."

On this conception, to have dignity involves making a choice about how we behave, refraining from certain activities or modes of presentation and elevating others. Construing dignity as admirable quality thus helps explain the common observation that some people have more dignity than others, and also allows that dignity can be displayed to a greater or lesser degree at any point in one's life. Dignity as admirable quality is not just a useful tool in making comparative, quasi-aesthetic judgments about people, though. As we'll see in more detail in Chapter 2, incorporating something like dignity as admirable quality into the theory will enable us to make sense of certain harms that accompany acts of torture, and to which we're also particularly vulnerable in healthcare settings.

### 2.4 Dignity as Respectful Treatment

The final conception of dignity to consider construes it in terms of respectful treatment (Rosen 2012, 61). Here dignity is not a feature that individuals possess, but rather a quality that inheres in the relationships between people. In Colin Bird's (2014) term, dignity is something that is "abroad" between people. Fleshing out this idea, Bird writes that human dignity "consist[s] in the ways we choose to dignify each other through conscious patterns of mutual respect, thereby making our dignity a concrete consequence of human action and placing its fate firmly in our hands" (p. 174). Linda Barclay (2018) offers a related conception of dignity. On her approach dignity consists in being treated with equal status, which is why dignity is particularly vulnerable in healthcare settings. More precisely, her view is that dignity "is something conferred in social relations where we follow social norms for treating people as having equal status. [. . .] To enjoy dignity is to reliably be treated in accordance with such norms" (p. 4).

As with the conception of dignity as elevated status, dignity as respectful treatment sees dignity as something that is conferred, rather than intrinsic. Unlike dignity as elevated status, though, this final conception of dignity illuminates the relationship between dignity and humiliation: since dignity is conferred through respectful treatment, manifestly *disrespectful* treatment amounts to a violation of dignity.

## 3. Desiderata for a Theory of Dignity

We have seen that dignity is called upon to do a wide variety of moral work, and has been understood in very different ways by philosophers. Given this diversity, it may be tempting to eschew any attempt at theorizing, and simply concede that dignity has multiple irreconcilable meanings.[^16] In some sense, I agree. Dignity cannot be reduced to a single unified conception, and attempts to do so threaten to obscure much that is morally interesting about the concept. However, it would also be a mistake to leave the philosophical playing field where it is. While Rosen has done an immense service by identifying the different conceptions of dignity at play in philosophical and legal discourse, his purpose is primarily diagnostic and cautionary: he is concerned with drawing attention to the confusion that reigns when the various conceptions of dignity are conflated. He is not, for the most part, concerned with vindicating any of these conceptions as viable or useful moral concepts.[^17] There is still important work to be done, then, in developing a theory of dignity that remains sensitive to the full range of contexts in which it is appealed to, but with the more ambitious aim of vindicating dignity as a coherent and useful moral concept.

In order for a theory of dignity to be useful, it needs to do two main things. First, it needs to accommodate the core uses to which the concept is put in everyday discourse, at least where this is theoretically viable. Failure to make such accommodations renders a theory irrelevant: it ends up being a theory about something other than what it purports to be about. Of course, not all uses can be accommodated in exactly the way their proponents intend. If a concept is used in a way that assumes things about the world that are patently false, or which cannot be accepted by those outside a particular worldview, then these assumptions ought not find their way into a secular theory. What can often be done instead, though, is to establish the motivation for using a concept in a particular way, and then retain that general impetus while stripping it of the problematic assumptions. This is precisely what I intend to do with the idea of dignity as an "inner transcendental kernel." Because the secular version of such a universally held kernel does not exist, it ought not to be presupposed by a theory. And while I stay neutral on the truth of religiously inflected versions of the inner kernel view, their metaphysical presuppositions render them inappropriate for my purposes. Nonetheless, the reasons for positing such a kernel *can* be accommodated: we can show why all human beings ought to be treated with respect, simply because of the worth they have as human.

The second thing a theory of dignity ought to do is demonstrate what moral work it is capable of. It's all very well to develop a theory that accords with popular usage, but if that concept turns out to be utterly irrelevant to our moral lives, it is unlikely to be of interest. My goal in this book is precisely to develop a theory of dignity that vindicates its place as an important moral concept. This is not to say, of course, that dignity is always morally desirable. As we'll see in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, dignity does have its limits, and it must always be weighed off against other important moral ends. We cannot even begin to do that weighing off, however, unless we first determine what dignity is.

What, then, are the core uses to which dignity is put, and which thus need to be accommodated by a theory of dignity? We have already seen several examples throughout this introduction. These can be distilled down into three key clusters, giving us three desiderata for the theory to satisfy. First, dignity has something to do with the respect people command. We see this most strikingly in the appeals made to dignity within human rights documents, where we are presumed to command respect in the form of human rights, on the grounds that we are human beings with dignity. Conversely, *failure* to respect a person frequently provokes complaint invoking the language of dignity. A North Korean state newspaper recently responded to a snide tweet from Donald Trump in the following terms: "The worst crime for which [Trump] can never be pardoned is that he dared [to] malignantly hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership."[^18] A good theory should explain what dignity has to do with respect, including both why the mere fact of being human commands respect in the form of human rights, *and* why being disrespected so often invokes protest in the name of dignity. Call this the *respect* desideratum.

Second, dignity is a variable quality, one that some people have in abundance and others manifestly lack, in accordance with their behavior. We can presumably all make sense of the claim that individuals such as Nelson Mandela or Martin Luther King instantiated a high level of dignity. Conversely, one only need stroll down Bourbon St. in New Orleans in the small hours of a Sunday morning to be left in little doubt that an individual can lack dignity, at least temporarily.[^19] Call this the *variability* desideratum.

Third, dignity is the kind of feature that can be damaged, or persons can be stripped of. In order to fully grasp the wrong of torture, for instance, we need to be able to make sense of the fact that victims point to violations of their dignity as among the cruelest effects. Similarly, the distress experienced by many of those subject to institutional medical care is often best understood through the lens of dignity. When hospital patients are left semi-naked on hospital gurneys, or when care home residents are expected to go to the toilet in full view of visitors, the language of dignity frequently springs to their lips. A good conception of dignity should be able to make sense of the fact that torture and invasions of privacy damage dignity.[^20] Call this the *fragility* desideratum.

My goal in Chapter 1 will be to sketch a theory of dignity that has the resources to satisfy all three desiderata, and to vindicate a place for dignity amongst our key moral concepts. It is to that task that I now turn.

[^2]: See especially (Macklin 2003, Pinker 2008). While not necessarily considering it useless, many more philosophers despair of finding a unified theory of dignity. See, i.e., (Barclay 2016, Kolnai 1976, Rosen 2012, Schroeder 2008). For resistance to the splitting of dignity into two or more concepts, see (Hursthouse 2007); it is also from Hursthouse that I borrow the imagery of dignity as interweaving strands.
[^3]: More common, though, is for a philosopher to privilege one particular conception of dignity, and theorize about *that*. This is what Remy Debes (2017) does in his recent edited collection, which is centered exclusively on the conception of dignity as inner worth.
[^4]: My methodology here is thus distinct from that recommend by Remy Debes (2009). Debes suggest we should start with a metatheory of dignity, which involves identifying the abstract "form" of dignity. While it might be tempting to think that specifying the form of dignity is just another way of specifying the desiderata that concept must satisfy, this would be to overlook a deeper methodological difference. According to Debes, "The fundamental methodological starting point of any theory of dignity must be to examine the nature of dignity—not its normative upshot" (p. 50). By contrast, I do not think dignity's desiderata can be specified independently of dignity's normative upshot; the normative upshot determines what those desiderata must be. My approach is thus much more pragmatist than Debes'.
[^5]: For those readers keen to explore moral or political theories which place dignity at their center, I recommend (Bernstein 2015) and (Margalit 2009).
[^6]: For a survey of how dignity has figured throughout Western history, see (Donnelly 2015); and for a survey of how dignity has featured in international law, see (McCrudden 2008).
[^7]: Doris Schroeder (2008) has also postulated four conceptions of dignity, though she carves the domain up slightly differently than Rosen. Her four conceptions are: Kantian dignity, Aristocratic dignity, comportment dignity, and meritorious dignity. Interestingly, Remy Debes' (Debes 2017) recent volume on the history of dignity focuses exclusively on the inner worth/ Kantian dignity conception. This has the effect of obscuring the extent to which a broader conception of dignity has been operative outside contemporary Western philosophy, meaning contributors to this volume are repeatedly brought to deny the role of dignity in transcultural settings. See, e.g.: "Insofar as dignity implies a substantial, non-conventional self or attaches importance to such a self, Buddhism does not support dignity" (Wong 2017, 71); and "the patristic and medieval literature has little to say about the species-wide, species-specific form of dignity commonly debated today" (Kent 2017, 95).
[^8]: Even dignity's critics tend to assume this is what dignity means. For instance, in his general broadside against dignity—part of an attempt to rehabilitate the competitor notion of honor—Tamler Sommers says of dignity: <blockquote> [It] is stable and enduring. At least in theory, we all have dignity simply by virtue of being human—and nobody can take it away. Dignity is like the participation trophy my daughter got after her team went 0–12 in her basketball league. Everyone gets one; it doesn't matter whether you win or lose or even how you played the game (Sommers 2018).</blockquote>
[^9]: For an intriguing alternative reading of Kant on dignity, on which we have dignity because we ought to be respected, rather than the more common converse, see (Sensen 2011).
[^10]: This has implications for the relationships between humans and non-human animals. I consider these in more depth towards the end of Chapter 5.
[^11]: For overviews of this idea see, (Düwell et al. 2014) esp. (Hollenbach 2014, Imbach 2014, Lorberbaum 2014).
[^12]: A similar distinction is drawn by Paul Formosa and Catriona Mackenzie (2014), who use the terms "status-dignity" and "achievement-dignity." They agree with Gilabert that status dignity picks out an elevated status in virtue of which individuals are owed certain things, whereas their achievement-dignity refers to the respect-worthiness of an individual's "beings and doings," and hence aligns with what I will go on to describe as personal and social dignity.
[^13]: For an alternative theory of human rights as independent from dignity as inner kernel, see (Sangiovanni 2017).
[^14]: This possibility is recognized by Laura Valentini. See her (2017, esp. n.8, p. 865).
[^15]: And here's his list of the *un*dignified: <blockquote> everything that is antithetic to distance, discretion, boundaries, articulation, individuation and autonomy . . .indiscriminate community or consorting or intimacy, promiscuity, domineeringness and servility . . .brutish and noisy, or even naively unreserved and of-a-piece self-assertion, self- assurance and self-complacency; self-pity, emotionalism, exhibitionism, demonstrativeness. . . untruthfulness and ungenuineness; hypocrisy, false pretence and the whole empire of the showy, flashy and gaudy, the Kitsch, . . . all that is levity, frivolity, irrelevance, shallowness, needless triviality (Kolnai 1976, 263).</blockquote>
[^16]: Those who have counseled such a retreat include (Brennan and Lo 2007, Kolnai 1976, Rosen 2012, Schroeder 2008, Spiegelberg 1971).
[^17]: The main exception here is Rosen's final chapter, where he explores the potential of dignity as respectful treatment for understanding the obligations we have to the dead.

[^19]: For those unfamiliar with New Orleans, we could just as easily substitute Rose St. in Edinburgh; Kings Cross in Sydney; or just about anywhere in the Costa del Sol.
[^20]: For a similar, though narrower, approach see (Maier 2011), who offers a conception of dignity derived from paradigm instances of torture. As he puts it, "The underlying idea is that a grasp of the very reasons for the wrongness of torture will improve our understanding of the concept of human dignity (p. 102)."
