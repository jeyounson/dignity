# 1. A Theory of Dignity

## 1. Clearing the Ground

The main goal of this chapter is to sketch the theory of dignity that will form the basis of the remainder of the book. Before I do that, though, it will be helpful to take a closer look at what I take to be its main rival: the "inner kernel" conception, whereby we have dignity because of some particular capacity (or set of capacities) that differentiates us from non-human animals. This is the conception that has gained most traction within the human rights literature, and which boasts the most prestigious pedigree, tracing its lineage as it does to Immanuel Kant. Moreover, this is the only conception of dignity outlined in the Introduction that I will be avoiding integrating into my own theory: all of the other main competitors find their way into the theory, in some form or other. As such, it is important to be clear about why I reject it.

Appeals to dignity as an "inner kernel" are, I claim, unnecessary, unsuccessful, and pernicious.[^1] Why such appeals are unnecessary will emerge over the course of this book, as I demonstrate how a theory of dignity that rejects the appeal to an "inner kernel" can nonetheless do all the moral work dignity is called upon to do. In this section, I will focus instead on establishing that such appeals are both unsuccessful, and pernicious.

The key challenge facing the dominant conception emerges in response to a question it cannot avoid answering: what is this "inner kernel," in virtue of which we're owed respect and moral concern, actually supposed to be? For those who follow the Kantian origins of this conception closely, a ready answer is available: we have dignity because we are capable of giving the moral law to ourselves. Or to put it more bluntly, we have dignity because, and insofar as, we are rational creatures.[^2] However, it follows from this claim that infants and at least some severely cognitively disabled individuals do not have dignity: however we cash out the capacities necessary for rationality or moral reasoning, there will be some age below which we lack those capacities, and some level of cognitive impairment beyond which those capacities are lacking. And since dignity grounds the claim that individuals must be treated with respect (i.e. as ends rather than means), we are led towards the particularly distasteful conclusion that infants and some severely cognitively disabled individuals need not be accorded respect or moral concern. As Robin Dillon (2003) notes,

> in claiming that only rational beings are ends in themselves deserving of respect, [Kantian ethics] licenses treating all things which aren't persons as mere means to the ends of rational beings, and so it supports morally abhorrent attitudes of domination and exploitation toward all nonpersons and toward our natural environment.

It may be tempting at this point to try to rescue the dominant conception by distancing it from its Kantian heritage. We may, for instance, try to identify dignity with some feature/s of humans other than their rationality.[^3] This is a particularly tricky move to pull off, though, if the features we're looking for are to be inherent to *all* human beings, as they must if dignity is to be held universally by all humans. We cannot, for instance, point to sociability, or creativity, or even self-consciousness, since for any feature that depends on certain cognitive capacities, there will be some human beings who lack them. As Michael Berubé (2009, 100) poignantly observes, "any performance criterion—independence, rationality, capacity for mutual cooperation, even capacity for mutual recognition—will leave some mother's child behind." This leaves features such as vulnerability, which *are* arguably universally shared. But then the problem shifts: if we have dignity in virtue of our vulnerability, why do we not share this dignity with other equally vulnerable creatures? And why would our vulnerability ground demands to treat us with *respect*, as opposed to some other kind of response, such as pity or care?

There is one more tactic that advocates of the intrinsic worth conception sometimes try. Rather than taking dignity to pick out some feature that all human beings share, the argument goes, we can pick out features that are common to *humanity*, and then attribute dignity to all human beings on the basis that they share a nature with the "typical" human who *does* possess the relevant features.[^4] The challenge such views confront is to explain what it is about "sharing a nature" that justifies according respect to all human beings, rather than just to those who actually possess the relevant features. In other words, if the reason why human beings as a category are special is because members typically exhibit feature *x*, *y*, or *z*, then why should I treat as special a human being who lacks features *x*, *y*, and *z*?

The way in which Daniel Sulmasy explains this strategy is instructive in illuminating its limitations. As he puts it, the logic of natural kinds suggests that one picks individuals out as members of the kind not because they express all the necessary and sufficient predicates to be classified as a member of the species, but by virtue of their inclusion under the extension of the natural kind that, as a kind, has those capacities (Sulmasy 2007, 16)

The example he uses to illuminate this point is bananas: even if "banana" is defined as a yellow fruit of a certain shape, he notes, some things that qualify as bananas will be green, or of a different shape. Fair enough. But note what happens if we shift from talking about what counts as a banana, to talking about what makes bananas special. If we start saying that bananas ought to be treated a certain way *because they're yellow*, it doesn't follow that the green bananas are owed that treatment just because they're members of the same natural kind. The same is true for human beings. If we say that human beings are owed certain treatment because they're rational, it doesn't follow that non-rational human beings are owed that treatment just because they're members of the same natural kind.[^5]

While we can of course simply give all human beings the benefit of the doubt (our ability to discern others' inherent features being questionable, at best), this doesn't address the root of the problem.[^6] We need some explanation as to why the features that are doing all the moral work need not be held by those we are morally obligated to respect.

The dominant conception cannot do one of the most central pieces of moral work it is called upon to do: it cannot explain how dignity underpins human rights. If inner worth is understood in terms of some kind of rational capacity, as it most commonly is, then it excludes from the realm of human rights those human beings who lack the relevant capacity. If inner worth is understood in terms of a universally shared feature of humans, then it cannot explain why non-human animals do not share our dignity, and hence why they are not entitled to human rights. Finally, if inner worth is understood in terms of a shared human nature, it cannot explain the normativity of our humanity, and hence cannot justify human rights.

While important, it is worth stressing that underpinning human rights is not the only moral work dignity is called upon to do. We saw some of that work in the Introduction: dignity is also a standard against which people are measured (the *variability* desideratum); and it is a quality that is threatened under conditions such as torture and hospitalization (the *fragility* desideratum). Construing dignity in terms of intrinsic worth undermines the potential for the concept to fulfill these two desiderata as well.

It is clear from the outset that the dominant conception cannot explain why some people are presumed to exhibit dignity to a higher degree than others, and thus fails the variability desideratum. That's because the dominant conception takes dignity to be a universal feature, which does not admit of degrees. If the dominant conception were taken to exhaust the meaning of dignity, then we would be forced to conclude that people are simply mistaken in the differential evaluations they regularly make about one another's dignity.

More troublingly, the dominant conception cannot make sense of people's claims that their dignity has been violated or destroyed, and thus fails the vulnerability desideratum as well. Daniel Statman puts this point especially clearly: "In short, if mere belonging to the human race is sufficient for having dignity (whatever this term denotes) then, necessarily, no human beings can exist who have lost, or have been stripped, of, their human dignity" (Statman 2000, 525). On the dominant conception, dignity is taken to be inalienable and invariable: we can't lose it, and it doesn't admit of degrees. At best, we could perhaps say that some acts are an *affront* to the dignity of the victim. But this analysis simply does not accord with agents' lived experiences—particularly when we consider acts such as torture, after which agents regularly invoke the language of dignity to communicate the depth of their suffering.

I think it is crucial to capture the full range of harms done to agents such as Mr al-Rawi, introduced in the Introduction, who was tortured at Abu Ghraib. While we can of course identify many moral wrongs involved in torture that do not make reference to dignity, and others that make reference only to dignity as the dominant conception understands it, such analyses risk leaving out much that is important. Mr al-Rawi isn't just physically and emotionally harmed; and it is not just that his captors failed to treat him with the respect that he is owed (true as both these claims are). Torture inflicts a very particular kind of damage; something about the agent changes when she is tortured, which victims find it helpful to describe in terms of damage to, or loss of, their dignity. Unless and until we find an alternative name for what is damaged, there is some reason to take victims at their word, and see if we can accommodate their experiences within our theory of dignity.[^7]

This reasoning does not just apply to extreme cases such as torture. In much more quotidian situations, agents find it fitting to describe their experiences in terms of damage or loss of dignity. Hospitalization; menial labor; sexual harassment: despite the irreducible differences between these phenomena, agents nonetheless regularly turn to the language of dignity to explain their impact. Importantly, these aren't appeals to dignity that mesh with the dominant conception: the claim is not (or not merely) that their dignity has been *disrespected*; the claim is that their dignity has taken a hit, it's been damaged. A good theory of dignity ought to accommodate such claims. I'll now sketch a theory that I think can meet this challenge.

## 2. Introducing the Three Strands of Dignity

In what follows I'll sketch my theory of dignity, teasing apart three distinct strands I take to be operative within that concept: personal, social, and status dignity.[^8] While there are important differences between personal, social, and status dignity, the three strands remain significantly intertwined. More precisely, each strand invokes the twinned concepts of *standing* and *respect*. As such, while I treat each strand separately, this should not be read as suggesting a multiplicity of dignity conceptions. Rather, the three strands explore different facets of a single idea: that to have dignity is to command respect; and conversely that *dis*respect constitutes one of the central ways in which dignity can be violated, frustrated, or destroyed.

The complexity of the theory is a result of disambiguation. Our day-to-day experiences of dignity and indignity tend to be somewhat inchoate. While the connection to respect and disrespect may be relatively apparent, we may not recognize that conceptually distinct forms of respect could be in play. Teasing apart these distinctions through the three strands of dignity provides a means to better understand the complexity of the general phenomenon.

The key differences between personal, social, and status dignity can be drawn out in terms of the following three questions: 1) How is dignity *constituted*? 2) What *form of respect* does dignity command? And 3) *whose respect* does dignity command? Before seeing how each of these questions is answered for the three strands, a quick detour is necessary to explain the difference between what Stephen Darwall (1977) has labeled "appraisal respect," on the one hand, and "recognition respect," on the other. This distinction plays an important role in what follows.

Appraisal respect is analogous to esteem, or high regard, and at least for my purposes it is directed at the "whole self " of its object. While I might admire your flowing locks, or quick wit, it will only count as appraisal respect if I admire *you* on the basis of these features. To have appraisal respect for someone, in Darwall's terms, involves "positive appraisal of that person either as a person or as engaged in some particular pursuit". Recognition respect, by contrast, consists in "a disposition to weigh appropriately in one's deliberations some feature of the thing and act accordingly" (Darwall 1977, 38). In other words, to have recognition respect for something involves acknowledgment of the kind of thing it is, and of the kind of response that is thereby appropriate. Again, for my purposes I am only concerned with recognition respect that attaches to *people*. To have recognition respect for someone, then, is to acknowledge their status as a kind of person, and the respectful treatment they are thereby due.

To summarize, appraisal respect involves a judgment of *quality*: we consider those who we respect in this way to manifest some kind of excellence, and thus call for our esteem. By contrast, recognition respect involves a judgment of *status*: we consider those we respect in this way to fall within a particular social category,[^9] membership in which calls for certain kinds of respectful treatment. While much more could be said about appraisal and recognition respect, this should suffice to be going on with.

To get back to the matter at hand: with regard to the first question, i.e. how is dignity constituted, I claim that we come to have *personal* dignity when we take ourselves to be subject to certain kinds of norms. By contrast, we come to have *social* dignity when we are subject to certain kinds of norms in virtue of our membership in a particular community.[^10] We come to have *status* dignity, finally, when we fall within a particular category, membership in which commands respectful treatment from others in our community.[^11]

This will all be explained in more detail below. To be clear from the outset, though, on none of the three strands can dignity be understood as an inalienable feature of persons. For each strand, that is, dignity is not a foregone conclusion for anyone (this is a necessary implication of a theory that foregrounds the possibility that our dignity can be damaged or destroyed). We can fail to have personal dignity, according to my theory, if we lack the capacity or will to hold ourselves to the relevant kind of standard; we can fail to have social dignity if we do not belong to any community that holds us to the relevant kind of standard; and we can fail to have status dignity if we do not fall within any category, membership of which commands respectful treatment.

This brings us to the second question: what form of respect does dignity command? Both personal and social dignity, I claim, call for appraisal respect. More precisely, personal and social dignity are both variable, measured in terms of how well we uphold the relevant norms (as well as the stringency of the norms we are subject to); that is, we are more or less dignified in accordance with the extent to which we uphold or transgress the relevant norms. When we are personally dignified, we call for our own appraisal respect: to be highly personally dignified is to be such that, by our own lights, we ought to hold ourselves in high esteem. Importantly, though, if we transgress the relevant norms, the appropriate response is not only withheld esteem, but can also extend to disdain. The same is true for social dignity, *modulo* the shift from subjective to social norms. When we are socially dignified, we call for the appraisal respect of our peers: to be highly socially dignified is to be such that, by the lights of our community, they ought to hold us in high esteem. Again, though, if we transgress the relevant norms, we potentially call not only for withheld esteem, but also the disdain of our peers.

Status dignity operates somewhat differently. Because it is held in virtue of a category membership in which commands respect, the relevant notion is *recognition* respect: status dignity does not call on others to esteem us, but rather to treat us in ways appropriate to the kind of thing we are.[^12] Accordingly, all persons who hold the same form of status dignity—that is, their dignity arises from membership in the same social category—command respectful treatment in the same way and to the same degree.[^13] While status dignity therefore cannot literally be *reduced*, as personal and social dignity can, it can nonetheless be damaged. This occurs when others fail to treat us in accordance with the relevant forms of respect.

The answer to the third and final question, namely whose respect is involved in dignity, is implicit in the answers already given: personal dignity involves *self-*respect, while both social and status dignity involve the respect of our peers. In sum, then, we have personal dignity through taking ourselves to be subject to a certain kind of norm; when we act in accordance with those norms we are more personally dignified, and hence earn an increase of self-respect, of the appraisal variety; conversely, when we transgress those norms we are thereby undignified, and invite our own disdain. We have social dignity, analogously, through being subject to norms of a certain kind, in virtue of our membership in a particular community; acting in accordance with those norms makes us socially dignified, and thereby commands the appraisal respect of our peers; while transgressing those norms makes us socially undignified and invites their disdain. To have status dignity, finally, is to be a member of a category that thereby entitles us to recognition respect, and our status dignity is protected or damaged in accordance with others' willingness to treat us in accordance with the relevant markers of respect.

This overview has been both highly abstract and extremely dense. I'll now move more slowly, exploring each of the three strands of dignity in turn. My goal in this chapter is simply to articulate the general structure of each strand of dignity. The utility of thinking about dignity in this way will emerge in the chapters that follow, as I explore the implications of each strand of dignity for our moral lives.[^14]

### 2.1 Personal Dignity

There is an important distinction within personal dignity between having dignity and being dignified. We *have* personal dignity, I suggest, simply in virtue of taking ourselves to be subject to a certain kind of norms. We are *more or less* personally dignified, by contrast, in accordance with the stringency of those norms, as well as our success or failure in upholding them.[^15] Personal dignity thus allows for significant variability between persons not everyone will be personally dignified to the same degree.

In order to better understand personal dignity, and the role it plays in our lives, it is necessary to get clear on the kinds of norms at stake. The norms relevant to personal dignity do not extend to *all* norms an agent takes herself to be subject to. For example, when an individual runs a red light she does not, typically, render herself any less dignified, and this is so even if she takes herself to be subject to the norm of obeying traffic lights. The norms must be *dignitarian* norms. The challenge is to get clear on precisely what that means.

I propose that the norms relevant to personal dignity are ones that connect to a very particular kind of appraisal respect. To be highly personally dignified is to be entitled to hold oneself in high esteem; conversely, to be personally undignified is to invite one's own disdain. More precisely, dignitarian norms are ones which the agent takes it to be *ennobling* to uphold, and whose transgression she takes to be *disgraceful* or *debasing*.[^16] Note here the allusion to height in the language of ennoblement and debasement: to be personally dignified is to be (entitled to be) *raised* in one's own eyes, while conversely to be personally undignified is to be (entitled to be) *lowered* in one's own eyes. In slogan form: dignitarian norms are the ones that articulate the grounds of our own self-respect.

Dignitarian norms can be understood by the agent as moral obligations, religious strictures, requirements of etiquette, or any other kind of normative demand. They can range over not only what she does but what she wears, how she speaks, and her public bearing. On this approach, it makes perfect sense to talk of the dignity of labor (an individual can find it ennobling to realize her productive powers in concert with her colleagues), and just as much sense to talk of the *in*dignity of labor (an individual can find it debasing to spend the bulk of her life as a mere cog in the capitalist machine). Crucially, personal dignitarian norms are purely subjective: *whatever* an agent takes to be ennobling or disgraceful, to do or fail to do those things will affect her personal dignity.[^17] The import of this subjectivity for the role of dignity in our moral lives will be explored in Chapters 2 and 3.

I have said that dignitarian norms are ones it is ennobling to uphold, or debasing to transgress. In many cases, one and the same norm will meet both conditionals. That is, one and the same norm will be such that to uphold it is ennobling, while to transgress it is disgraceful. Modes of selfpresentation often have this structure: an individual may take it to be ennobling to ensure his shoes are always well-polished when he leaves the house, and disgraceful to leave the house with scuffed shoes. In some cases, though, an agent may take it to be ennobling to uphold a certain standard without taking it to be disgraceful to transgress it, and vice versa. For example, an individual may take it to be ennobling to refrain from responding snarkily to a sexist or racist comment, without taking it to be disgraceful to do so.[^18] Conversely, an individual may take it to be disgraceful to accept a bribe, without taking it to be ennobling to refrain.

Already, we can see that the theory has important resources to start meeting the desiderata laid out in the Introduction. The personal dignity strand has no trouble making sense of the variability desideratum. It is

A possible exception to this might be strictly *moral* norms. Whatever the moral truths are, we might say, someone ought to take it to be debasing to transgress them, and hence her dignity is violated if she is forced to transgress them. I'm more sympathetic with this restriction in place; but I think integrating this limited objectivity into the theory would cause more complications than it's worth. This is because my main concern with personal dignity is to illuminate the ways in which it can be violated, frustrated, or destroyed—and the transgression of moral norms (where those aren't recognized by the agent in question) rarely figures in these transgressions.

manifestly clear how it can accommodate the claim that dignity comes in degrees, with people such as Nelson Mandela or the Queen of England exhibiting high levels of personal dignity, while drunken revelers on Bourbon St. have little personal dignity to speak of. Nelson Mandela, by all accounts, was a man of immense virtue and admirable strength of will, who refused to debase himself through bitterness or resentment and instead chose the difficult but ennobling path of reconciliation. And whatever the Queen's *moral* character, she is undoubtedly a stickler for the stiff upper lip, and holds herself to very stringent standards of public decorum (a quality less obviously held by her husband, the notoriously gaffe-prone Prince Philip, to whom, it is worth noting, the label "dignified" is not readily applied). Drunken revelers, meanwhile, can frequently be seen violating what we can only assume are their own dignitarian norms: there's a reason they are not urinating on the street at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, but instead doing so once their inhibitions are lowered through a few pints.

While more nuance will be added to the variability of dignity once the strand of social dignity is brought into the picture, my theory is already in a better position with respect to the variability desideratum than either the dominant conception, or Waldron's elevated status conception. Though very different in other ways, both of those conceptions presuppose dignity to be an all-or-nothing affair, and whether inherent or conferred there is nothing *we* can do, in our day-to-day behavior, to affect the extent or nature of our dignity.

The strand of personal dignity also makes important headway on the fragility desideratum. As we'll see in more detail in Chapter 2, this strand offers a ready explanation for what it means to *violate* an individual's dignity: an individual's personal dignity is violated, we can say, if she is compelled to transgress a dignitarian norm, thereby debasing herself. If an agent takes it to be debasing to appear in public naked, for instance, then to force him to appear in public naked violates his dignity. Similarly, if an agent takes it to be disgraceful to appear in public without her head covered, then forcing her to appear in public with her head exposed violates her dignity. Importantly, such violations can be readily understood as *reducing* the victim's dignity, since transgressing these norms renders them undignified. Victims of dignity violations are thus correct when they report that the incident was not only an affront to their dignity, but actually damaged it.

In addition, personal dignity makes sense of the centrality of dignity to elder care. Nursing homes are often sites at which personal dignitarian norms become difficult to uphold. When people decry the loss of dignity in old age homes, what they often seem to have in mind are the way in which the elderly are toileted, whether they are dressed in accordance with their own sense of decorum, and so forth. These deeply personal norms become difficult for elderly people to uphold independently, and unfortunately nursing homes can be better or worse at helping them do so.

That said, personal dignity misses something important about paradigm cases of dignity violation. This gap comes into view if we focus on the dignityrelated harms of humiliation. In many cases, a key purpose of humiliation is to induce personal shame, and so to succeed it must target something the victim finds shameful, and force her to do or be that. Personal dignity is well equipped to explain how such humiliation constitutes a dignity violation, and why it is harmful. From the perspective of personal dignity, humiliation involves forcing an individual to transgress a norm, and thereby disgrace herself. It is a very short step indeed from this to inducing personal shame, as we'll see in Chapter 2. What personal dignity fails to accommodate, though, is the extent to which humiliation is so often *public*. Typically, when an individual is humiliated she is not only forced to transgress her own norms, but is also forced to transgress *social* norms. The goal of humiliation is thus often *public shaming*, where the individual is lowered in the eyes of her community, over and above the instilling of subjective shame. Personal dignity does not have room for such an observation, because it focuses exclusively on the relationship between the individual and her own internalized norms. This will need to be remedied through the weaving of a social dignitarian strand into the theory.

There is another implication of personal dignity that will need to be countervailed with the introduction of complementary strands of dignity. Because personal dignity is constituted when an agent takes herself to be subject to certain kinds of norms, it is contingent upon an agent possessing quite sophisticated cognitive capacities. An agent must have a self-conception, and that self-conception must be sensitive to her own behavior. Assuming there are at least some forms of cognitive impairment that preclude individuals from taking themselves to be subject to norms of this type, at least some individuals do not have personal dignity. This would obviously be a grave problem for the theory, if personal dignity were the only strand in play. As we'll see, though, acknowledging that some individuals lack one strand of dignity does not threaten to render the theory morally problematic: the nature of the harms involved in personal dignity violations are simply not present for individuals who lack a self-conception. That does not mean, however, that such people cannot be significantly harmed through having their dignity violated, which will become clear once we have brought social and status dignity into the picture.

Finally, though, personal dignity cannot satisfy the respect desideratum. As we've seen, when an individual achieves a high level of personal dignity she commands her own appraisal respect. This is not, however, the kind of respect the respect desideratum is appealing to. The respect desideratum points to the very prominent idea that to have dignity is to command respectful treatment from others. In other words, the respect desideratum demands a place for *recognition* respect, which is absent in personal dignity.

While personal dignity cannot single-handedly fulfill the three desiderata, it is nonetheless a crucial strand of the theory. In particular, personal dignity illuminates types of harm prevalent in both torture and many healthcare settings: that is, the harms that follow from either being forced to transgress one's dignitarian norms, or being denied the necessary assistance to uphold those norms. I'll explore these harms in detail in Chapter 2, but for now just make the preemptive claim that the moral work personal dignity enables us to do suffices to justify its inclusion in the broader theoretical framework I'm developing here, even though it must be supplemented with additional strands of dignity.

### 2.2 Social Dignity

We saw in Section 2 that personal dignity is constituted by the agent taking herself to be subject to dignitarian norms. Social dignity, by contrast, is constituted when an agent is subject to dignitarian norms in virtue of her membership in a particular community. Just as for personal dignity, not all of the community's norms will be dignitarian. Paralleling personal dignity, social dignity is constituted through being subject to norms the transgression of which the community takes to be debasing or disgraceful, or the upholding of which the community takes to be ennobling. For instance, if we are a member of a community that takes it to be disgraceful to urinate in public, then we are socially undignified if we urinate in public, and we thereby invite the disdain of our community. Conversely, if we are a member of a community that takes it to be ennobling to wear a headscarf in public, then we are socially dignified if we wear a headscarf in public, and we thereby command the esteem of our community. What it means to be socially dignified, then, will depend on social context: to be socially dignified in an aristocratic society will involve upholding very different norms than if one sought to be socially dignified in bourgeois society (cf. Henderson 2017, 279).

Andreas Sangiovanni offers a nice example of the phenomenon of what I'm calling social dignity, in his discussion of etiquette norms of the Renaissance, as laid out in Castiglione's *Book of the Courtier* (1528). The relevant piece of advice concerns the appropriateness of a gentleman engaging in a wrestling match with a peasant, with Federico advising against unless the gentleman is sure of victory. In Sangiovanni's words:

> [W]e can summarise Federico's claim in this way: should a gentleman lose in a wrestling match with a peasant, he would be failing to live up to standards of bearing, reputation, and virtue intrinsic to his elevated role, and hence would not merit the esteem or worth that meeting such standards would otherwise earn him. (Sangiovanni 2017, 20)

Translated into the terms of my theory: it would be socially undignified for a gentleman to lose in a wrestling match with a peasant, so he is well advised to avoid such a possibility.

Social dignity is admittedly complicated by the fact that most individuals are members of multiple, overlapping communities. Our social dignity will thus be instantiated in many different ways: an individual can have social dignity with respect to her profession, her religion, her nation, and so on. Since these communities can hold us to very different—and perhaps even conflicting—norms, an individual may be in the invidious position of having to sacrifice her social dignity in one community in order to uphold it in another.[^19] While this makes social dignity very hard to quantify, it also has an important upshot: almost everybody will be subject to at least *some* community's norms, and hence virtually everybody will possess social dignity. This is true even for those who lack the capacities necessary for the possession of personal dignity.[^20]

Social dignity fills in some important gaps left by personal dignity. Consider the following hypothetical (though unfortunately not far-fetched) case:

> Nora has a severe cognitive disability. One of the effects of this disability is that she does not recognize any norms governing her conduct: correspondingly, she experiences no diminishment of self-esteem, irrespective of what she does. One day a group of young men cajole Nora into stripping naked, take photos of her in various compromising poses, and share the photos widely on social media.[^21]

On my theory, what is happening here has no effect on Nora's *personal* dignity, because the standards that she is being forced to contravene are not her own. Nonetheless, this would still be a paradigmatic case of dignity violation, because Nora's *social* dignity is being violated.

To see why this is so, it is important to note that what the young men are doing here is deliberately putting Nora into a situation in which she is transgressing the community's norms of sexual conduct. Put more simply: they are deliberately humiliating her. Importantly, their attempts at humiliation only make sense if Nora is in fact recognized as being subject to the norms that are being violated, and as thereby being disgraced by their violation. It is relevant that the young men in this example are choosing to sexually humiliate a young woman, and not an inanimate object, like a rock. It makes no sense to try to disgrace rocks, because there are no norms that a rock can violate. Young women, by contrast—even cognitively disabled young women—can violate a good many social norms, and it is this (admittedly regrettable) fact about our social world that lies behind the cruelty of the young men's behavior.[^22] Ironically, then, the young men's attack on Nora's dignity actually serves to reaffirm her *possession* of dignity.

Nora clearly *has* dignity, because she is subject to the dignitarian norms of her community (otherwise, the attempt at humiliation would make no sense). And she clearly has her dignity *violated*, because she is being forced to contravene those norms (that is the whole point of the humiliation).

Social dignity thus goes a long way to ensuring the theory as a whole satisfies the fragility desideratum, which, as we saw above, personal dignity could not do alone. When personal and social dignity are combined in the one theory, as I propose we do, then we have grounds to say that even those with severe cognitive disabilities can have their dignity violated. Moreover, we get a fuller sense of the harms involved in dignity violations. When an individual is humiliated, the harm she suffers is not merely the subjective harm of damaged self-respect. Her standing in her community is also affected; she suffers the *social* harm of being lowered in the eyes of her peers.

As for personal dignity, though, social dignity fails to accommodate the claim that the simple possession of dignity commands recognition respect, in the way the respect desideratum demands. To satisfy this desideratum, and complete the theory, we need to turn to status dignity.

### 2.3 Status Dignity

The key differences between personal and social dignity, on the one hand, and status dignity, on the other, lie in the form of respect they involve, and the grounds of that respect. For personal and social dignity, it is *appraisal* respect that is called for: to have a high level of personal or social dignity means it is appropriate to be esteemed, whether by ourselves or by others. This follows necessarily from the structure of the theory. To have a high level of personal or social dignity just is to have done what is ennobling, and hence to command esteem. It is this requirement that respect be earned that prevents personal and social dignity from adequately satisfying the respect desideratum. When it is claimed that persons are owed respect in virtue of their dignity, this is most plausibly interpreted as saying such respect need not be earned.[^23] We are meant to get it for free, simply in virtue of being creatures who have dignity. This is especially true when dignity is invoked as the grounds for human rights: we need not be remotely virtuous or accomplished to have human rights, it suffices that we are human, because our humanity contains our dignity.

Status dignity calls for recognition respect, and thus is well positioned to satisfy the respect desideratum. The ground of status dignity is simply our membership in the relevant social category. More precisely, we have status dignity insofar as we are entitled to respectful forms of treatment in virtue of our membership in a particular social category. As such, the recognition respect we command is not simply a response to our status dignity, but also constitutive of it.[^24] Unlike personal and social dignity, status dignity does not come in degrees: everyone who holds status dignity in virtue of membership in a particular social category holds status dignity to the same degree, and hence commands the same form of recognition respect.

Consider the dignity of a judge. Part of what makes a judge dignified is that she upholds certain standards applicable to judges (carrying herself with a certain gravitas, say, or not allowing herself to be swayed by personal animosities in her decisions). A judge can thus be more or less *socially* dignified, *qua* judge, insofar as she upholds these profession-specific standards.[^25] But another aspect of a judge's dignity obtains in virtue of the ways in which the rest of us are obliged to respond to her—standing when she enters a courtroom, say, or addressing her as "Your Honor" rather than by name. These obligations attach to her *status* as a judge: part of what it means to be a judge is to be owed certain expressions of respect. Being owed these expressions of respect, I claim, is constitutive of her status dignity, *qua* judge.

What is true for judges, I propose, is true for a multiplicity of different social categories. Families, friendship groups, nations, religions, ethnic groups, professions—all have norms concerning how those who are members ought appropriately to be treated, even if these are typically less explicit than for judges.[^26] As for social dignity, then, an individual is likely to have her status dignity instantiated through multiple, overlapping communities.

To violate an individual's status dignity is to fail to treat her in accordance with the recognition respect she is due, in virtue of her membership of a particular group. For instance, an academic community might have a norm of introducing visiting speakers by their title; to then introduce a particular visiting speaker by her first name would be a violation of her status dignity, *qua* academic. Likewise, a family might have a norm of not eating until all family members are seated. To violate this norm for one particular family member would be a violation of her status dignity, *qua* family member. Finally, consider Jeremy Waldron's influential account of the harms of hate speech. According to Waldron (2012b), hate speech is pernicious precisely because it calls into question the target's *dignity* as a fellow citizen. "A person's dignity . . . is their social standing, the fundamentals of basic reputation that entitle them to be treated as equals in the ordinary operations of society . . . . The publication of hate speech is calculated to undermine this" (p. 5).

Violations of our status dignity call our standing within the relevant group into question. Particularly if those who violate our status dignity are members of the same group, their actions communicate that they do not take us to be appropriate objects of recognition respect. In doing so, they are denying our status as full-fledged members of the group. This explains one of the key harms committed in the academic speaker example above, despite its superficial air, and why such harms are experienced as indignities: they focus attention on the individual as someone who is not entitled to the relevant forms of respect, and hence communicate that she is not a member in good standing.

The possibility that status dignity can be violated adds a further layer of complexity to the theory's response to the fragility desideratum. While an individual whose status dignity has been violated doesn't thereby become any less (status) dignified, she is nonetheless thereby *harmed—*her social standing is being challenged and potentially eroded. If such violations continue unchecked, there is always the possibility that her status dignity (in that community) will be lost altogether.

The incorporation of status dignity into the theory also straightforwardly explains the connection between dignity and respect, thus satisfying the respect desideratum. To have status dignity *just is* to command recognition respect, in virtue of one's membership in a particular group. While the form that recognition respect will take—that is, the precise nature of the treatment one is owed—will differ depending on the understanding each group gives to membership, to be recognized as a member of a group entails that one commands respect, which is just another way of saying that one has status dignity.

Of course, when philosophers and human rights practitioners appeal to the respect we command in virtue of our dignity, they do not have in mind the kind of recognition respect owed to judges, or any other localized community. They are appealing to a *universal* form of dignity, one held by all human beings, which commands respect in the form of among other things—recognizing and upholding our human rights. This brings us to the final strand of the theoretical tapestry: human dignity.

## 3. Human Dignity

Human dignity plays a central role in much of moral and political philosophy. In that capacity, human dignity refers to the ground of the respect we are owed, *qua* human. Traditionally, philosophers have sought to explicate human dignity in terms of some intrinsic feature of persons, such as rational capacities or normative agency, which is of sufficient import to command respect. As we saw above, pursuing this path has the pernicious consequence of denying that individuals with severe cognitive impairments have dignity, and hence that they are owed respect. In light of this exclusionary implication of the "inner kernel" conception, I propose instead to understand human dignity as just one more instantiation of status dignity. Just as we can have status dignity in virtue of our membership in a profession, or a religion, or a nation, so too we can have status dignity in virtue of our membership in the human community. And just as those other communities are social categories rather than natural kinds—that is, they are categories that exist in virtue of the norms and practices of humans, rather than "in the wild"—so too the category of "human" relevant to human dignity is a social category, the product of social norms and practices that have brought it into existence and imbued it with meaning.

I thus propose that it is a social fact about our current world that we have constituted a global community of human beings, and in doing so have created a very special kind of human dignity. While this human community shares its boundaries with the species boundary, it is not in virtue of species membership per se that human beings have dignity, and are entitled to respect. Rather, just as we have with judges, or with royalty, we have created a social category "human" and endowed membership with a rich and complex meaning. Part of that meaning involves the forms of recognition respect appropriate to humans, a significant component of which involves the attribution of human rights. As Jay Bernstein puts it, "Being bestowed a right is how the community both expresses and gives substance to its valuation of its members" (2015, 138). To put this point slightly more forcefully: there is nothing special about the boundary around the species "human being" apart from the meaning that we've imbued it with, and the norms of treatment we've constructed with respect to it. Nonetheless, every human being is entitled to respect *qua* human, since this is part of the meaning that has been constructed for the human.

Human dignity is just a particular manifestation of status dignity, with the human community taking the place of more localized communities. Our human dignity is constituted by our socially constructed status as humans, and the respect we command as humans is a function of the norms at play within the human community concerning what forms of treatment members are owed.[^27] As we saw above, one of the key differences between status dignity on the one hand, and personal and social dignity on the other, is that status dignity does not vary in degree: since there is nothing we have to do to earn status dignity, holding it simply in virtue of our membership in the relevant group, and because the form of respect status dignity commands is *recognition* respect, we get a straightforward explanation of the universality and invariability of human dignity. We are all equally human, and hence all equally have human dignity, which commands the same form of recognition respect for all of us, given our membership in the category "human."[^28] Nonetheless, we can *violate* someone's human dignity, which we do when we fail to treat her with the kind of respect she is owed *qua* member of the human community.

There is much more that needs to be said about human dignity. Not least, I owe a more detailed analysis of the norms I claim constitute the recognition respect we are owed *qua* humans. Even more importantly, I owe a justification for the normative import of human dignity: if human dignity is just a side effect of the construction of a social category, why ought we care at all about respecting it? In other words, why think such a conception of human dignity could adequately fulfill the respect desideratum? This is especially pressing given the stark contrast between human dignity as I've presented it here, and how that term is typically understood.[^29] I will attempt to pay off at least some of these debts in Chapter 5.

## 4. Dignity vs. Honor

Before moving on, it will perhaps be helpful to say something about the relationship between dignity and honor. These two concepts are intimately related—especially if we adopt the theory of dignity I have laid out above. Consider, for instance, Kwame Anthony Appiah's (2011, 175) claim that "having honor means being entitled to respect," which has very strong echoes of my claim in Section 2 of this chapter that "to have dignity is to command respect." Are we perhaps appealing to the same phenomenon with different terminology? There is some reason to think that we are. Appiah fleshes out his definition of honor by claiming that "If you adhere to an honor code, you'll not only respond with respect to those who keep it, you'll respond with contempt to those who don't." This sounds very much like what I would call social dignity: if someone upholds the social dignitarian norms that we ascribe to, then we would respond with respect; conversely, if they violated those norms we would respond with contempt. Appiah also claims that "if you yourself meet the standard, you'll have self-respect; and if you yourself fall short, you will have contempt for yourself, which is shame." This is again very close to what I am calling personal dignity.

The parallels between honor and dignity are not just idiosyncratic to Appiah. In his book-length attempt to rehabilitate honor as a moral value, Tamler Sommers (2018) regularly appeals to the distinction between "horizontal honor" and "vertical honor." According to Sommers, horizontal honor is what we are owed simply in virtue of being a member of a group. "Having horizontal honor," he writes, "is like being a member of a club. And membership has its privileges." Vertical honor, by contrast, must be earned, which we do by engaging in activities deemed respect-worthy by the honor group. This distinction between horizontal and vertical honor maps quite neatly onto my distinction between status dignity and social dignity, and is a useful way of further illuminating those categories.

Sommers does, admittedly, work hard to differentiate his conception of honor from dignity; but in doing so he focuses on the very notion of dignity that I have argued we can and ought to do without. "Honor," he writes, "is tenuous and fragile, and it has to be preserved and defended with vigilance. Dignity, by contrast, is stable and enduring. At least in theory, we all have dignity simply by virtue of being human—and nobody can take it away." If *that* were what dignity must be, I would agree with Sommers that we should be shifting our attention to honor.

Since what I am calling dignity has for others traveled under the label of honor, why insist on the former terminology? The choice is, admittedly, somewhat discretionary. This does not mean, however, that it is arbitrary. The literature on honor has quite a distinct focus from the literature on dignity, grappling primarily with the phenomenon of "honor cultures," and the ways in which individuals pursue esteem within groups. In part because of this focus (or perhaps explaining it), honor has a very different resonance from dignity, evoking very different contexts. When people are hospitalized, or tortured, or harassed, it is typically not their *honor* that they appeal to at least, not in contemporary Western cultures. For whatever reason, the language we reach for in such circumstances is the language of dignity, not the language of honor. To adequately capture these experiences, without importing the negative valence honor so frequently carries, I find it helpful to echo that language here. That said, given the commonalities between dignity and honor, it would be a mistake to overlook the rich resources which study of that concept can provide.

[^1]: Jay Bernstein (2015, 264) goes even further in his critique of inner kernel views: "Nothing has done more harm to the discourse of human dignity than the assumption that there is some magical property, say the possession of the power of reason, whose simple possession by an individual suddenly gives her the standing of having intrinsic and inviolable worth."
[^2]: Remy Debes' synopsis of the Kantian view is representative. "According to Kant," he writes, "the normative ground of dignity—what justifies our duty to treat persons as ends in themselves—is our rational nature or autonomy" (Debes 2017, 205).
[^3]: For theories in this vein, see, i.e. (Darwall 2006, Margalit 2009, Nussbaum 2006).
[^4]: Variations on this move are defended by, among others, (Kateb 2011, Liao and Etinson 2012, Sulmasy 2007, Tasioulas 2014).
[^5]: For a similar critique, see (Jaworska and Tannenbaum 2013).
[^6]: Which is not to say we ought not to employ what Ian Carter (Carter 2011) calls "opacity respect," choosing not to enquire into certain of a person's characteristics in determining how to treat her. For an interesting take on the relationship between opacity respect and equality, see (Sangiovanni 2017).
[^7]: It has been helpfully suggested to me by Julian Sempill that we could also make sense of such accounts in terms of *alienation* from one's dignity; i.e. feeling out of touch with, or unable to fully believe in, our status as moral equals. I suspect such alienation is very much part of the experience of torture, but don't think it accounts for all of it—which is why an alternative to the inner kernel view is so necessary.
[^8]: This theory builds on some of my earlier work, but extends it in new ways. In my earliest work on dignity (Killmister 2010), I was only thinking in terms of what I now call personal dignity. In my more recent work (Killmister 2016, 2017, 2018) I introduced what I now call social dignity, but was still missing the import of status dignity. This absence led to what I now see to be a problematic account of human dignity.
[^9]: In Chapter 4 I'll explicate the connection between status dignity and *social kinds*. In the meantime I'll refer to the simpler notion of category.
[^10]: Cf. Charlotte Witt's discussion of social normativity, (Witt 2011, esp. Ch 2).
[^11]: Compare (Valentini 2017). She draws a distinction between what she calls "passive status dignity" and "active status dignity." These roughly map onto my status dignity and social dignity, respectively. The parallels with Valentini's account are even stronger when we turn to *loss* of dignity*.* For Valentini, "passive status dignity" is violated when we're treated as we ought not to be, just as I claim is the case for status dignity violations; and her "active status dignity" is lost when "we fail to live up to the standards of behavior that apply to us" (p. 866), just as I claim is the case for social dignity violations.
[^12]: Remy Debes (2017, 211–2) argues that dignity *simpliciter* commands recognition rather than appraisal respect. This is in keeping with his project, which construes dignity exclusively in terms of what I would call human dignity, which I agree commands recognition rather than appraisal respect.
[^13]: Cf. Jeremy Waldron's (2012a) claim that to have dignity is to have a certain *rank*, and thus to be entitled to certain forms of treatment.
[^14]: In particular, I hope to demonstrate the utility of construing dignity in such a value-neutral way, which is admittedly counterintuitive. To anticipate, I think a value-neutral account enables us to recognize the full spectrum of harms to which we're vulnerable with respect to our dignity; and it also forces us to do the hard work of establishing when the harms attached to dignity violations constitute moral wrongs, rather than presupposing the moral wrongness of all dignity violations.
[^15]: Cf. Michael Meyer (1989) who takes the *having* of dignity to depend (in part) on the capacity for self-control, while the *expression* of dignity depends on the exercise of self-control. This is also one way to read Aurel Kolnai's (1976) discussion of uncontrolled passion: Kolnai notes that in being swept away by passion, the agent nonetheless expresses some amount of dignity. On my account, that would be explained by the fact that the agent acknowledges the standards she is violating, even at the moment she violates them. Unlike Meyer and Kolnai, though, my theory offers an explanation as to the source of the standards by which the agent's dignity is measured, and allows for a distinction between dignity that is grounded in subjectively recognized standards, and dignity that is grounded in social standards. This distinction will prove crucial in grasping the full range of harms individuals are subject to when their dignity is violated, as we'll see in the following chapters.
[^16]: Henceforth I'll use the terms "debasing" and "disgraceful" interchangeably. While not quite synonymous, they both appeal to the "lowering" quality of dignitarian norms, which is what I'm really after. Why not say, instead, that personal dignitarian norms are ones it would be *shameful* to transgress? If the term is used loosely, that is very much what I want to say. Shame is, however, an extensively theorized emotion, and not all theories of shame fit with what I am getting at here. For instance, Gabrielle Taylor, who offers one of the most influential theories of shame, construes shame thus: "The person concerned believes of herself that she has deviated from some norm and in doing so she has altered her standing in the world" (Taylor 1985, 1). And she later observes that "Whenever a person experiences shame then he experiences an injury to his self-respect" (p. 80). So far so good. However, Taylor also construes shame in terms of *how we think others see us*. To feel shame, for Taylor, is to take up the perspective of a real or imagined audience, and agree with their lowered estimation of you: "The agent is seen as deviating from some norm, and in feeling shame he will identify with the audience's view and the consequent verdict that he has lost status" (p. 57). Heidi Maibom (2010) goes even further in this direction: on her account, to feel shame is to feel oneself lowered in the eyes of others. In order to maintain the theoretical distinction between personal and social dignity violations, I prefer to tease apart the sense we have of falling short of our own standards, from the sense we have of falling short of socially shared standards. Since theories of shame often collapse this distinction, the term will need to be used carefully in what follows.
[^17]: A reader for OUP has helpfully suggested that dignitarian norms might depart from being purely subjective, just insofar as there are some norms we *should* take it to be debasing to transgress. (The same challenge recurs for social dignity, below.) While I feel the temptation to build such an objective standard into the theory, I remain skeptical that there are norms that are truly universal in this way, such that for any person, at any time, they ought to consider it shameful to transgress them. We need only revisit Kolnai's list of the undignified character traits (quoted in the Introduction, at n.14) to see how ludicrous some of these seem now, from a mere few decades away. What might seem obviously debasing to us, here and now, may quite rightly—come to seem perfectly appropriate behavior with the benefit of hindsight.
[^18]: Consider Michelle Obama's famous injunction "when they go low, we go high." One way to read this is as an appeal to citizens to "rise above the fray," and thereby do something ennobling. We needn't assume, though, that Obama takes it to be *disgraceful* to respond in kind.
[^19]: Robert Oprisko (2012, 12) makes a similar point about honor. I consider the relationship between honor and my theory of dignity below.
[^20]: Children pose an interesting challenge here, particularly around the question of when they come to be subject to the relevant norms. While it's beyond the scope of this book to explore the issue in any depth, I suspect that children are gradually initiated into social dignity through adults displaying simulacra of esteem or disdain, to teach the relevant norms, with the attendant reactive attitudes only coming "online" as the child matures.
[^21]: Todd May (2014, 161–2) offers a similar example, in the service of arguing that dignity cannot depend upon the possession of rational capacities.
[^22]: While intentional humiliation provides the most obvious example of damaging social dignity, it is by no means the only one. What matters is that the individual is being forced to contravene normative standards, and so is being put in a position that her community considers disgraceful or debasing. So even if the young men in the example saw Nora as no more a member of their community than a rock, and had thus not been intentionally engaged in humiliation, this would still constitute damage to her social dignity, since the broader community's norms of sexual conduct were still being contravened. Similarly, if an individual were left in a state of utter destitution by a natural disaster, rather than by the deliberate actions of an oppressive government, she may find herself unable to uphold the standards of the community, and hence her social dignity would be damaged.
[^23]: This is explicitly demanded by Remy Debes: "'Dignity' (as a concept) purports to identify the existence of a kind of moral community between humans the 'membership' of which is unearned and normatively privileged" (Debes 2017, 209).
[^24]: Status dignity has echoes of what Daniel Sulmasy calls "attributed dignity": "By attributed dignity, I mean that worth or value that human beings confer upon others by acts of attribution. The act of conferring this worth or value may be accomplished individually or communally, but it always involves a choice. Attributed dignity is, in a sense, created. It constitutes a conventional form of value." As he goes on to clarify, however, his attributed dignity is restricted to a form of *appraisal* respect: "we attribute worth or value to those we consider to be dignitaries, those we admire, those who carry themselves in a particular way, or those who have certain talents, skills, or powers" (Sulmasy 2007, 12). My account, by contrast, ties this form of dignity to *recognition* respect.
[^25]: For a vivid example of a judge failing to be socially dignified, *qua* judge, see Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's recent performance at the Senate Committee hearing regarding allegations of sexual assault. (Full coverage available at https://www.youtube.com/ watch?v=j6EF0nuFjCw)
[^26]: Valentini (2017, 876–7) makes the same point about her own conception of status dignity: "we may plausibly distinguish between different types of status dignity depending on the particular role one occupies. We can talk about one's status dignity as a friend, family member, professional colleague, member of the human community and so forth."
[^27]: My account of human dignity is building upon Jeremy Waldron's (2012a). The key difference between us is that I take human dignity to be just one instantiation of one strand of dignity, rather than exhaustive of the concept. This complexity will have important pay-offs once we start looking more closely at dignitarian harms.
[^28]: There is nonetheless the at least conceptual possibility of expulsion from the human community. I consider this possibility in Chapter 5.
[^29]: Compare, for instance, this statement from Teresa Iglesias (2001, 114), which she puts forward as a "bedrock truth": "To be a human being is not a status conferred upon me by anyone. Nor is this a status that I, nor anyone else, can confer upon others. We are natural beings, and find ourselves existing as what we are, human beings."
