# 5. Human Dignity and Human Rights

One of the most frequent invocations of dignity is in relation to human rights. We have human rights, it is commonly asserted, *because* we have dignity (Griffin 2008, Tasioulas 2014, Gilabert 2015). Such an invocation almost inevitably appeals to a conception of dignity as "inner kernel": we have human rights because we have dignity; and we have dignity because we possess some special intrinsic capacity or feature. As we saw in Chapter 1, such an approach to dignity threatens to exclude some of the most vulnerable individuals in our communities, not least those with significant cognitive impairments. When dignity, so conceived, is injected into a theory of human rights, the result is a theory of human rights that cannot accommodate individuals with severe cognitive impairments. I take such a conclusion to be deeply problematic. The purpose of this chapter is thus to suggest an alternative way of thinking about human dignity, and with it human rights. My strategy is to take human dignity to be just another instantiation of status dignity—something we possess in virtue of our membership in a socially constructed category. In Section 1 of this chapter I'll explore what it means to conceive of human dignity in this way; in Section 2 I'll demonstrate how such a conception of human dignity can be integrated into a theory of human rights; and in Section 3 I'll consider the moral force of human dignity, so conceived.

## 1. The Meaning of Human Dignity

Human dignity, on my account, is an especially important instance of status dignity. In other words, we *have* human dignity in virtue of our status as humans, and what our human dignity *commands* is the recognition respect appropriate to that status. At that level of description, my account mirrors that of the "inner kernel" conceptions of dignity critiqued in Chapter 1. Where my account parts ways from the inner kernel conceptions is in how it conceives of the status of human. Rather than understanding that status in terms of some natural feature or capacity, with its attendant risks of excluding the most vulnerable amongst us, I understand the status of human in terms of membership in a social category. To be human, then, is analogous to being a citizen, a royal, a judge, or a parent—all social kinds that were canvassed in the previous chapter.[^1]

None of this is to deny that there is *also* a natural kind "human"—I stay neutral on that proposition here. All I am suggesting is that we have constructed a social kind "human" that is conceptually distinct from whatever natural kind there may be. To see how this duality works, consider an analogy with the social kind "parent." While in some narrow contexts that term might refer to a natural kind, i.e. individuals who occupy a certain reproductive role, the term more typically refers to individuals who occupy a certain kind of *social* role, which is broader than the natural kind, e.g. by including adoptive parents. The social kind "parent" thus comes apart from whatever biological analogue there may be, and its boundaries are determined by social norms, formal rules, and institutional practices, rather than natural properties. Likewise, the privileges and entitlements that attach to being a parent in the social kind sense come apart from whatever privileges and entitlements (if any) attach to being a parent in the natural kind sense.

The comparison with the social kind "parent" is useful in another way, too. It is clear that what it means to be a parent, and who counts as a parent, is not static. The social kind "parent" has been constituted in different ways at different times and places. The same is true for the social kind "human." Different communities have had different social norms concerning both who counts as human, and how humans ought to be treated. In doing so, they have generated different social kinds. There will thus be different instantiations of human dignity, and correspondingly different ways in which human dignity can be violated in different communities.

There is one instantiation of human dignity that is especially relevant, however, and it will form the focus of the remainder of this chapter. Alongside the numerous local variants of the human that have emerged across different times and places, a global variant has also emerged. To be clear, the idea here is not that there has been a global convergence on what it means to be human. Rather, the global variant of the human kind is constituted by a web of social norms, formal rules, and institutional structures that have global reach. Importantly, appealing to global reach does not require that these norms, rules, and institutions be universally accepted or respected. Rather, it requires them to have sufficient power to shape people's lives globally, whether through influencing their self-understanding as human, or influencing the institutions with power over them.

A full exploration of this topic would seek to do for the human what Benedict Anderson (1991) famously did for the nation, exploring the historical convergences which made possible the imagining of a particular kind of community. My concern here, though, is less about how the human kind came to be, and more about the content of the norms through which human dignity is constituted. As for all instantiations of status dignity, the central question we need to ask about human dignity is what forms of recognition respect members of the human kind are entitled to.

In identifying the global norms for how humans ought to be treated, it will be useful to first consider the analogous question with respect to citizens. To be a citizen is to be a member of a social kind, just as to be a human is to be a member of a social kind. In both cases, the category in question is one that we have created. Moreover, just as for the human, citizens are entitled to certain kinds of treatment in virtue of their citizenship. What they are entitled to constitutes their status dignity *qua* citizens, and hence to fail to accord citizens what they are entitled to is a violation of their status dignity. At the very least, we can say that citizens are entitled to recognition of their legally mandated civil rights. So in the US context, if a police officer searches a citizen's car without reasonable grounds, she thereby violates his status dignity. Likewise, if a customs agent refuses to let a citizen re-enter the country, say because of his religion, she thereby violates his status dignity.

If the legal bundle of civil rights fully determined what someone was entitled to *qua* citizen, then we could read the scope and content of her status dignity straight off it. It would also follow that someone's status dignity, *qua* citizen, could only ever be violated by failing to respect one of her legally mandated civil rights. What citizens are entitled to is not so narrow, however. It is crucial to recognize that once a legal status such as citizen is constructed, it takes on a broader life of its own.[^2] People start to think of themselves *as* citizens, and to see one another under those terms as well. In our role as citizens we are drawn into a network of social and political practices that feed back into our understanding of what it means to be a citizen.

These relationships and practices generate an additional layer of social norms delineating how fellow citizens ought to be treated. These may well be harder to articulate than their legally instantiated cousins, and are no doubt more likely to be contested, but they are no less relevant to status dignity for that.

Just as for the dignity of citizens, global human dignity encompasses both the formal rights conferred on individuals in virtue of their being human, and the informal global social norms that have emerged regarding how humans ought to be treated. The former are primarily a matter of institutionalized human rights, especially as those have been articulated in various UN treaties and covenants. The latter are more ephemeral, and also more contested. To determine their content, we would need to identify and articulate the expectations we hold one another to, at a global scale, in virtue of our humanity. Such a survey is beyond the scope of my abilities, but I do think we can identify some likely contenders, especially if we examine fictional or historical accounts that we are invited to see as instances of *dehumanization*.

Take, for instance, Kazuo Ishiguro's (2006) heart-breaking novel *Never Let Me Go*, in which we follow young students who, we slowly learn, are human clones created to be organ donors. Bracketing for a moment the fact that the students were clones, Ishiguro is clearly inviting us to see the treatment of these young people as inhumane. To be human, Ishiguro is suggesting, is incompatible with being raised merely to provide organs to others. Generalizing, we can say that Ishiguro is identifying a global norm such that humans are entitled not to be treated in a purely instrumental fashion.

Similarly, we can look to Margaret Atwood's (1986) dystopian novel *Handmaid's Tale*, along with its recent television remake, to identify another potentially global norm of treatment for humans. Along with all the other indignities suffered by the Handmaids in Gilead, they are denied their names. Each handmaid is instead called after their Commander—*Of*fred, *Of*glen, and so on. This refusal to name reflects a more general refusal to see the Handmaids as distinct individuals, with lives of their own. Broadly speaking, to deny someone a name, and to instead to refer to them by a number, or other anonymizing marker, has come to symbolize a failure to see that person as human. To be human, we might say, is to be entitled to a name.[^3]

Finally, consider the way in which mass graves constitute a crime against humanity. The crime here, importantly, is not merely in the individuals' deaths, in and of itself, but also in the way those deaths are then treated as insignificant. Saul Bellow describes this phenomenon well:

> I too had seen newsreels of the camps. In one of them, American bulldozers pushed naked corpses towards a mass grave ditch. Limbs fell away and heads dropped from the disintegrating bodies. My reaction to this was similar to that of Mrs Abel—a deeply troubling sense of disgrace or human demotion, as if by such afflictions the Jews had lost the respect of the rest of mankind, as if they might now be regarded as hopeless victims, incapable of honorable self-defense, and arising from this, probably the common instinctive revulsion and loathing of the extremities of suffering a sense of personal contamination and aversion. The world would see these dead with a pity that placed them at the margin of humanity. (cited in Bernstein 2015, 278–9)

Borrowing a term from Judith Butler (2006), I suggest that to be human is to be *grievable*, in the sense that there is a global norm such that a human death ought to be marked in some way as a significant event—the antithesis of which is the mass grave.

This is clearly not an exhaustive list. Nonetheless, it suffices to draw attention to an important point: what we are plausibly owed *qua* membership in the social kind "human" does not reduce to what we are owed *qua* members of the species *homo sapiens*. What it means to be human is what we've made it, which in turn is a product of how we've come to imagine it, and this extends well beyond what is given by our "human nature" (cf. Diamond 1991, 1978, Elliott 2003). This means, importantly, that what we're entitled to doesn't have to be justified solely in terms of natural properties such as susceptibility to pain, or rational capacities. What we're entitled to depends on the social norms and formal rules that have emerged with respect to the human kind. Just as, in some cultures, royalty must be curtseyed to, so too humans must be grieved, and named, and so forth. And just as we need not point to any natural property held by royals in order to justify the norm of curtseying to them, so too we need not point to any natural property held by all humans to justify norms of naming them, or grieving them.[^4] Such treatment is a way of respecting someone's human dignity. Conversely, to fail to treat someone in these ways is a *violation* of her human dignity.

To summarize: on my account, to violate someone's human rights is always to violate her human dignity, but her human dignity can also be violated if we fail to treat her in accordance with a more ephemeral social norm, provided that norm has sufficient global uptake as a necessary way to treat humans. It might be questioned, however, whether human rights violations are *always* violations of human dignity. There are a range of human rights whose transgression could arguably be understood as something other than a human dignity violation. For instance, if a journalist has their work censored by an authoritarian government, or if a worker is prevented from forming or joining a trade union, the language of human dignity may not be the most obvious or fitting way to evaluate these wrongs.[^5] I share this intuition, but think it can be accommodated.

Where human rights overlap with civil rights, it may well be that the rights in question are more central to some people's self-understanding as citizens than to their self-understanding as human—especially in countries where civil rights are given a higher prominence in the public discourse than human rights. When those rights are violated, then, they will be experienced by many individuals as failures to respect them as citizens, rather than failures to respect them as humans. Just because some people may not automatically reach for the language of human dignity in such cases, though, it does not follow that human dignity is not at stake. A single act can violate multiple forms of status dignity, though it makes sense that we focus on the status for which the norm in question is most central to its meaning.

I'll say more about the relationship between dignitarian norms and human rights below. First, though, I need to address the question of how membership in the human kind is determined. To show that my account of human dignity is a viable alternative to the inner kernel view I need to show that it is truly universal, which requires addressing the question of membership in the human kind head-on.

In Chapter 4 I suggested that membership in different social kinds may be constituted in different ways. For some social kinds, such as "police officer" a constitutivist approach is most viable: there are socially constructed "rules" determining who is a member, and so someone can be a member even if those around them deny their membership status (say if they are working undercover). For other social kinds, such as "celebrity," a conferralist approach is more plausible: to be a member *just is* to be taken by the relevant parties to be a member. For other social kinds—gender, race, sexuality—membership may be constituted in some other way. What, then, should we say about the human?

My goal here is not to lay out a definitive theory of membership in the global human kind. Rather, I hope to achieve the more modest end of demonstrating that there are a range of different accounts of membership that could be developed, each of which has the upshot that all *homo sapiens* are members of the global human kind. This is not to say, of course, that it would be impossible to posit a social constructionist theory of the human without that upshot. But I take it to be a desideratum of a theory of human dignity (and with it a theory of human rights) that it can explain how and why all *homo sapiens* have human dignity. By sketching two distinct pathways by which such a theory could be developed, I hope to show that the social constructionist project is more viable than it is sometimes taken to be.

The first account of membership in the global human kind I'll sketch draws on the work of John Searle (1995, 2010). According to Searle, we can understand what he calls social facts through the formula "X counts as Y in context C." In this formula, X typically stands for some material object, while Y stands for a deontic status. For instance, a river can count as a national border, or a piece of metal can count as legal tender. Crucially, the deontic status of Y is not explicable just in terms of the physical features of X—the rights, powers, and responsibilities definitive of Ys are *assigned* to Xs, through what Searle calls a "status function declaration." This occurs when a community collectively recognizes the status in question—for instance, a community can come to recognize a stone wall as a "border," and in doing so they ascribe a deontic status to the wall above and beyond its physical properties.

How might such an approach be applied to the human? Searle himself tells us:

> The logical structure is that we must treat being human as a status, like being private property, being a secretary of state, or being married. In the formula "X counts as Y in context C", the Y term is "human being"; so if you qualify as a human being, you are automatically guaranteed rights . . . . [T]he X term is simply a set of biological facts that constitute being a member of our species. To satisfy those conditions is to count as a human being . . . and as a human being the bearer of rights. (2010, 181–2)

The key question for a Searlean account of the global human kind concerns the community that is responsible for the collective recognition wherein the status of the human is constituted. Searle himself does not, to the best of my knowledge, address this question, but a possible answer goes as follows. Irrespective of where we lay responsibility for the initial status function declaration, we can identify a community that plays a central role in *maintaining* collective recognition. Both in the formal practice of human rights, exemplified through the various United Nations organs and treaties, as well as in broader human rights discourse, it is taken for granted that human rights are held by all *homo sapiens*.[^6] Through their application of human rights, UN bodies and human rights NGOs strengthen the status function declaration whereby *homo sapiens* count as human, where the latter means bearer of human rights. In other words, by taking all *homo sapiens* to have human rights, these institutions contribute to *making it the case* that all *homo sapiens* are human.[^7]

We need not look exclusively to international institutions, though. Broader social practices also contribute to the maintenance of the social fact that being fully human is a status that extends to all *homo sapiens.* Time and again, students of history are shown examples of societies that deny the humanity of some members—Nazi Germany; Rwanda during the 1994 genocide; the pre-civil war south of the United States—with the accompanying lesson that these societies were making a category mistake. Moreover, students are typically taught not just that *these* societies were mistaken, but that *any* denial that some *homo sapiens* are fully humans would likewise be a mistake.[^8] Such social disciplining contributes to making it the case that the boundaries of the human are where the discipliners say it is. As Searle puts a similar point:

> By continuing to use the vocabulary of status functions we reinforce the status functions. Unlike shirts and shoes, institutions do not wear out with continued usage. On the contrary, the continued usage of such institutions as marriage, private property, and money reinforces the institutions, but the "usage" requires talk, and the talk functions to maintain and reinforce both the institution and institutional facts within the institutions. (Searle 2010, 104)

On a Searlean account, then, it is our collective recognition of the status of the human that maintains it. Whenever we pronounce on the idea that all human beings have human rights, or castigate someone for using dehumanizing language, we are strengthening that status.

A Searlean account is not the only way to develop a fully inclusive theory of the human, though. Consider, for example, what a conferralist like Ásta could potentially say about the social kind human.[^9] For Ásta, recall, membership in social kinds is conferred, and this conferral is context sensitive. Here is the schema Ásta takes to be generally applicable to membership in social kinds:

> Conferred property: P
> Who [does the conferring]: a person or entity or group with standing 
> What [does the conferring]: their conferral, explicit or implicit, by means of attitudes and behavior
> When: in a particular context
> Base property: the property or properties the authorities are attempting to track in the conferral, consciously or unconsciously. (Ásta 2018, 22)

And here's how this might be adapted for membership in the global human kind:

> Conferred property: bearer of human dignity
> Who [does the conferring]: the global community
> What [does the conferring]: attitudes and behavior acknowledging the norms associated with human dignity
> When: ongoing
> Base property: membership in the species 'homo sapiens'.

A few comments on this abstract schema are needed. First, by "global community" I mean participants in what Rorty, following Robossi, calls "the human rights culture" (Rorty 1993). That culture is marked by a pretheoretical commitment to human rights; in other words, the idea that all human beings have human rights is simply taken for granted. This culture is by no means universal, but it is global: even though there are dissenters, there are participants of that culture in all corners of the globe. Participants of this culture confer the status of human on all (who they take to be) *homo sapiens*, and they do this through their attitudes and behavior. The attitudes and behavior in question may be as quotidian as assuming that those they meet have names, or expressing sadness at human rights violations in distant parts of the world. Importantly, this conferral need not be face-to-face.[^10] Insofar as participants in this culture engage in imagining a global community for whom these norms apply, they confer the status of being human on everyone within that imagined community (cf. Anderson 1991).

An important point to note about this conferralist account is that it has the resources to block at least some concerns about the contingency of membership in the global human kind, which is especially pressing when we are contemplating the possibility that our status as human depends on others' attitudes towards us. For many social kinds, there are questions about whether they "travel": so on at least some theories of race, one and the same individual might be Black in New Orleans, but white in Brazil. This might raise the worry that the human also fails to travel, such that one is human in one context, but not in another. Importantly, though, this possibility simply does not arise, at least for the global variant of the human. This is because, precisely in virtue of being global, there is no "outside" we could travel to. So while it may well be possible that we take on and lose membership in local variants of the human as we enter and leave different communities, we never leave the global community (except through death), so we are always a member of the global human kind. Similarly, the denial by some individuals—or even whole communities—that we're fully human does not undercut our status as human. What matters, on the conferralist account, is not unanimity, but critical mass. Just as an individual is a celebrity in virtue of having achieved a critical mass of popularity, and even a large pocket of naysayers cannot undercut that status, an individual is human in virtue of a critical mass of people taking her to be human (where, to reiterate, this does not need to involve a face-to-face encounter).

It's important to note, however, that while an individual cannot be excluded from the category of the human simply through the attitudes of her immediate peers, a social constructionist approach must concede the possibility that the boundaries of the human could shift. Indeed, attempts to alter these boundaries are already in evidence. For instance, there is currently a push to include great apes within the reach of human rights.[^11] If this movement were successful, and given the import of the practice of human rights in determining membership on both accounts considered above, we could potentially witness an expansion of the human kind to include some non-human animals. We are also invited to expand the boundaries of the human through fiction, especially when it introduces us to non-*homo sapiens* who demand to be treated as human. The TV series *Westworld* is paradigmatic in this regard. The show centers upon the lives of humanoid robots, who are unaware of their status as mere showpieces in a theme park whose attendees delight in treating them in ways forbidden with respect to "real" humans. The show suggests that if artificial intelligence were ever to become a reality, we would be confronted with a stark decision: do we reconfigure the basis on which we confer or construct membership into the global human kind, with all that entails, in the face of creatures who demand entry?

Of course, the boundaries of the human can shrink as easily as they can expand. There is certainly no shortage of political rhetoric to the effect that some *homo sapiens* are not "real" humans. In the week in which I write this, Donald Trump's scandal *du jour* concerns this statement: "You wouldn't believe how bad these people are. *These aren't people, these are animals*, and we're taking them out of the country at a level and at a rate that's never happened before" (cited in Davis 2018). However, while it is clearly important not to become complacent about the inclusivity of the human (a point to which I will return in Section 3 below), it is also important not to understate its reach. On either a Searlean or an Ásta-inspired account, what it takes to be a member of a human kind is that the global community recognizes you as a member. This means that, even if you belong to a community for which you do not meet their local criteria for being human, there is nonetheless a global variant of the human in which you will be held. We can thus truthfully say, for every single human being, that they have human dignity, and can therefore lay claim to the forms of recognition respect that accompany that status—including, most prominently, respect for their human rights.

## 2. Human Dignity and Human Rights

Much of the recent philosophical debate over human rights has focused on the question of foundations. As the debate is commonly construed there is a rift between orthodox approaches, on the one hand, which seek to derive human rights primarily from pre-institutional moral rights,[^12] and political approaches, on the other, which reject the necessity of philosophical foundations and instead construe human rights in terms of the practice as it is found in the world today.[^13] To conceive of human dignity as status dignity is to take a side in this debate; it is to offer a political theory of human rights. That said, the theory of human rights I'll develop here does not altogether do away with foundational components, and nor does it wholeheartedly embrace the political program. Let's get clearer, then, on just what each side of the debate is committed to, and where my theory of human rights sits with respect to them. This will help elucidate the relationship I am positing between human dignity and human rights.

There are three interrelated features that those on the orthodox side commonly exhibit. These are: first, that human rights are those rights we have in virtue of being human; second, that human rights are derived from some universal and inherent property of persons; and third, that human rights are pre-institutional, in the sense that they do not depend for their existence on the recognition or enforcement of any political institution or practice.

I agree with orthodox theories on their first feature, but reject the latter two. On my view, human rights *are* held in virtue of being human—though admittedly not in the way that the orthodox theorist typically assume. For orthodox theories, human rights are held in virtue of being human *because* human rights are taken to derive from some universal and inherent feature of persons. The position taken by orthodox theories here mirrors the position taken by those who posit an "inner kernel" conception of dignity, and it inherits all the same problems. Especially troublesome, in this context, is the fact that orthodox views are exclusionary: any individual who lacks the relevant property does not have human rights. James Griffin, for instance, identifies the relevant property as normative agency, arguing that such agency is central to our personhood, and is thus a viable candidate as the foundation of human rights. However, he acknowledges that this has the implication that human rights don't extend to all human beings, but instead are only borne by those with the appropriate rational capacities (Griffin 2008, 83–94).

While Griffin is willing to bite this bullet, I am not. Not only does such exclusion threaten to perpetuate injustices against some of the most vulnerable members of our community, it is also in tension with a constitutive feature of the concept of human rights, as it is commonly understood, namely that they are the rights that extend to all human beings, simply because they're human. This point picks up on a common complaint about orthodox theories: they fail to connect with human rights as a feature of the world today. While orthodox approaches may well be offering a theory of *some* category of rights, their lack of attention to the way human rights actually function means they aren't succeeding in offering a theory of *human* rights.

By contrast, my approach to human rights has a different way of determining which individuals have human rights. Drawing on the idea of social kinds, I have argued that "the human" can be understood as a socially constructed category, membership in which is determined by reference to social practices.[^14] The precise details of this membership depend on the theory of social kind membership that we deploy, but on both accounts I surveyed above human rights practice plays an instrumental role in making it the case that all *homo sapiens* are human, and hence bearers of human rights. Insofar as the contemporary practice of human rights assumes their extension to all human beings, then, my account will consider all human beings to have human rights.

On this point, it's worth noting, human rights practice is not assessed against some independent criterion; we don't ask whether the practice "gets it right" in who is picked out as bearers of human rights, in the metaphysical sense that there's some pre-existing category of rights-holder that the practice ought to map onto. Rather, the practice of human rights has helped *determine* who the bearers of human rights are, and it is now a relatively settled feature of the practice that all *homo sapiens* are bearers of human rights, and hence members of the human kind.

There is another reason to reject the second of the orthodox commitments, i.e. their commitment to deriving human rights from some naturalistic property of persons. Insofar as orthodox theories take the content of human rights to be derived from one or more features typical of human beings, such as rationality or agency, they also take the content of human rights to be relatively fixed. This leads to an undesirable conservatism, in that it doesn't sufficiently allow for the practice of human rights to evolve and expand in its ambition, as conditions for human advancement improve.[^15]

To be fair, orthodox theories can allow for new human rights to emerge, insofar as these rights are derived from a more general right. For instance, assuming an orthodox theory includes a human right to physical security, it can allow that a new *specific* right—to borrow a phrase from Pablo Gilabert (2011)—is derivable from the *abstract* right to physical security, as new threats emerge. What the orthodox approach has more difficulty with is the idea either that new *sui generis* rights might emerge, or that the content of a particular right might alter as our capacity to fulfill it increases. Of the *sui* 

*generis* type, we might consider something like the sometimes proposed right to the internet (Best 2004). While there is perhaps some story we can tell whereby access to the internet is necessary for free speech, or for sharing in scientific advancements, this overlooks the possibility that such a right might be justified on the basis that the internet comes to be seen as a new form of good, of sufficient importance to human flourishing in the twentyfirst century that we can claim access as a human right. In terms of altering content, consider rights such as subsistence, or education. On an orthodox model we have such rights because they are necessary to protect or preserve some feature of persons. As such, the level of, i.e., subsistence or education that the right entitles us to is set by those features, rather than by the level of economic and social advancement of global society.[^16]

On my approach, by contrast, human rights form part of our articulation of how members of the human kind ought to be treated. This builds flexibility into the very concept of human rights; as global social norms evolve, so too does the content of human rights (I'll say more about how this works shortly, in discussing interactive kinds). This approach thus allows that, say, a human right to the internet may emerge. All that would be required is that the global community come to see the right to the internet as something that all human beings have the standing to demand. Likewise, this approach allows that the content of rights to subsistence or education might become more demanding in response to increases in global wealth. Admittedly, how progressive human rights become depends on the direction that these social norms take, and there is no guarantee this will always be towards the recognition of stronger rather than weaker rights. Nonetheless, my account at least leaves open the possibility for such an expansion, in a way that orthodox approaches struggle to do. It allows for a constant ratcheting up within human rights practice: the more demanding our expectations of one another, and the deeper our sense of our own worth as humans, the more expansive human rights practice will be required to become.

This brings us to the last of the orthodox approach's three common features, institutional independence. The preceding discussion suggests where my theory sits with respect to this commitment: human rights are the expression of a social achievement, rather than a pre-political fact to which political institutions ought to accede. That said, human rights, as I understand them, are not simply legal rights. On my account, the existence conditions of human rights turn on whether or not there is a global social norm to recognize them as such. What I mean by a norm recognizing a human right as such is that there must be a global social norm that human beings ought to be treated a certain way, *and* that responsibility for ensuring the norm is not violated is understood to lie primarily with the individuals' government, where failure to ensure the norm is not violated is a matter of international concern. Being a matter of international concern does not necessarily mean that violations of the norm are understood as a limit to state sovereignty (contra Rawls 2001, Raz 2010), but rather that their violation justifies a response from political actors across the globe, directed at the state in question. Here I follow Charles Beitz, (2009) who sees human rights as "a public normative practice of global scope whose central concern is to protect individuals against the consequences of certain actions and omissions of their governments" (p. 14). While my account is thus deeply political, it nonetheless leaves room for critique of human rights practice: if the practice lags behind the social norms, it is failing to adequately uphold the full suite of human rights. I'll return to this point shortly.

Let's turn now to the political side of the debate, which contains a more eclectic mix of views. Laura Valentini (2012) has usefully provided a taxonomy specifying three distinct ways in which a theory might be considered political: a theory might construe the principles laid out by human rights as evaluating political institutions, rather than individuals (what she calls human rights' "iudicandum"); a theory might identify human rights with the results of a political process of justification; or a theory might restrict the content of human rights to those ends that are politically feasible. My concern is with a subset of Valentini's first category, which is sometimes called a *functionalist* approach to human rights. A functionalist approach starts from the practice of human rights, seeking to identify the special role they play in international relations. For instance, both John Rawls (2001) and Joseph Raz (2010) point to the role of human rights in setting limits on state sovereignty, while, as we've just seen, Charles Beitz (2009) points to the slightly looser idea of human rights as identifying issues of "global concern." Crucially, the typical functionalist approach is decidedly anti-foundationalist. Each of these theorists eschews the need to say anything substantive about what it means to be human, seeing this as at best pointless, and at worst counterproductive, to the understanding and dissemination of human rights in the world today.

It might well look at first glance that my approach follows the anti-foundationalist line. I, too, have identified a role for human rights in international politics, albeit one that differs slightly from that picked out by most functionalists. And I have also cast grave doubts on the orthodox project of identifying some special property of persons, in virtue of which we have human rights. Indeed, I seem to have inverted the standard relationship orthodox theories propose between human dignity and human rights. On their views, human dignity refers to whatever inherent property grounds human rights; on my view, by contrast, it looks like human dignity is in large part a *product* of human rights. Human dignity is a form of status dignity, and hence it is constituted by the norms of treatment owed to members of a particular community. Since human rights are simply part of the broader set of norms of treatment owed to members of the human kind, it would seem that we have human dignity (at least in part) in virtue of having human rights.[^17] While this is indeed an accurate summary of all I've said so far, the story is nonetheless more complicated. To better understand the relationship between human dignity and human rights, it will be helpful to invoke Ian Hacking's notion of *interactive kinds*.

In Hacking's terminology, an interactive kind is a kind "that can influence what is classified" (1999, 103). More precisely, interactive kinds refer to "classifications that, when known by people or by those around them, and put to work in institutions, change the ways in which individuals experience themselves—and may even lead people to evolve their feelings and behavior in part because they are so classified" (p. 104). To see how this works in practice, consider the classification "Aboriginal" in the Australian context. While there have always been Aboriginal people in Australia, that category has gained significance since settlement. The colonial state apparatus created a legal and social classification that was then imposed on a highly diverse population, regulating—and all-too-often damaging—the lives of those who were so classified. This legal and social categorization facilitated the generation of a pan-Aboriginal identity, over and above membership in particular nations, through which claims and protestations could be leveled, and hence influencing self-understandings.

Importantly, we also see here an example of what Hacking calls "looping effects": those on whom a classification is imposed can in turn effect changes on the classification. We see this clearly in the example of Aboriginal Australians: group members have not been passive in the face of either governmental or social determinations as to who counts as Aboriginal.[^18] This has resulted in a change in the way classification operates; rather than membership being determined by a blood quantum rule, as it was historically, membership is now primarily determined by an individual being officially recognized as such by an incorporated Aboriginal community. Not just the boundaries of a classification, but also the meaning of the classification, are up for grabs with interactive kinds. In other words, members of interactive kinds can change not only who counts as a member going forward, but also what legal, medical, political, educational, etc. implications follow from classification.

The human, as I am understanding it, is an interactive kind with looping effects, and one whose interactivity is tightly connected to the practice of human rights. Of course, it would be next to impossible to accurately map the interactivity of any looping kind, let alone one as diffuse as the human. What follows, then, should be understood as an idealization. We can start with the emergence of human rights as an element of international political and legal practice in the post–World War II world. As has been frequently noted, one of the most distinctive characteristics of the emergent human rights regime is how it positioned the human individual, rather than the state, as the primary locus of rights in the global realm (Beitz 2009, Weinert 2015). In other words, human rights practice picks out a subject, "the human," and declares it to be the holder of a cluster of fundamental rights. This is true not just rhetorically, as seen in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' (1948) famous preamble declaring that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world," but is also embedded in the operations of institutions such as the International Criminal Court, whose jurisdiction covers egregious crimes committed against individuals. Once this legal subject comes into existence, though, it affects our subjective understanding of what it means to be human. However else we understand ourselves, we can now *also* understand ourselves as rights-holding creatures, creatures who are owed certain kinds of treatment merely in virtue of being human.[^19] We have a new discourse, a new language, through which we can make claims, and assert ourselves into political space.

Importantly, the claims we can make include new demands on the practice from which our status initially emerged. In other words, our self-understanding as rights-holders can embolden us to demand an expansion of the rights we ought to be recognized as holding. Now that I see myself as holding a privileged status as a bearer of human rights, I might start to question other forms of treatment to which I am subjected. If a critical mass comes to share my perspective, a new human right can emerge, and with it a shift in what it means to have human dignity.

Construing the human as an interactive kind suggests a different way of thinking about the foundations of human rights. It is commonly claimed that we have human rights because we have human dignity (Griffin 2008, Gilabert 2015, Tasioulas 2014). At first glance, my approach looks like it inverts that claim: we have human dignity, I have argued, because we have human rights. Because the human is an interactive kind, though, the story doesn't stop there. Once "the human" becomes part of enough people's selfunderstanding, our human dignity becomes more than just a disconnected cluster of entitlements; it becomes a basis from which we can reflect upon, critique, and revise that cluster of entitlements. In that sense, human dignity is not only constituted by human rights, but also serves as a foundation for human rights, by offering a standpoint from which human rights can be assessed and critiqued.[^20]

In sum: human rights, on my account, form a core part of the recognition respect we are owed in virtue of our human dignity—in virtue, that is, of our membership in the human kind. They do not, however, exhaust that recognition respect. Human rights pick out the subset of forms of recognition respect whose violation is taken to justify a response from political actors globally, and not all failures to treat individuals as humans ought to be treated will meet this condition. Human rights, on this approach, are not eternally fixed features of the moral world, but rather evolve alongside changes in our collective self-understanding. This does not place the practice of human rights beyond critique, though, because our collective self-understanding can evolve in ways that outstrip our political institutions.

## 3. Claims to Human Dignity

So far I have explained what human dignity is, and how it can be built into a theory of human rights. In this closing section I tackle what is perhaps the biggest challenge for my account of human dignity: its normativity. Human dignity, on my account, refers to a status we confer on one another. We attain this status through meeting a very simple criterion: membership in the species *homo sapiens*. To hold this status is to be entitled to a certain kind of recognition respect, constituted by the global social norms governing how we ought to treat one another as humans. These global social norms find their apotheosis in the practice of human rights, which institutionalizes, protects, and promotes many of them. But if human dignity is merely the name we give to a socially conferred status, why are we morally obligated to respect it? And if human rights are merely the institutionalization of social norms, how can they morally bind us?

### 3.1 Human Dignity Violations

To understand the scope of our moral claims against having our human dignity violated, we need to return to the general framework developed in Chapter 4. There, I argued that we have a *prima facie* moral claim to be recognized *as* members of the social kinds to which we belong, and to be treated accordingly. This moral claim was grounded in our interests in self-understanding and social standing, and was valid if it met three criteria: satisfying our demand not to have our status dignity violated must not perpetuate the oppression of others; there must be a significant harm involved in having our status dignity violated in the relevant way; and our demand must actually accord with the norms of membership and treatment for the relevant social kind. The very same is true for human dignity. We each have a *prima facie* moral claim to be recognized as human, and treated accordingly, which includes having our human rights upheld.

Let's consider each of these three criteria, to establish the conditions under which we can demand that our human dignity not be violated. The third criterion is the easiest to deal with, so I'll start there. For any human being, with respect to any institutionalized human right, it follows by definition that the demand accords with the norms of membership and treatment for the human kind. Admittedly, it may be hard to assess someone's claim when it appeals to a more ephemeral or contested norm—but these are epistemic, and not moral, difficulties.[^21]

The second criterion is also relatively easy to deal with. To violate someone's human dignity will virtually always cause them significant harm, because of how important it is to be able to see oneself as human, and to be seen by others as human. Of course, our interest in self-understanding or social standing is unlikely to be the most salient when we are pressing a demand, say, not to be tortured—obviously, our interest in avoiding severe physical pain, or even in avoiding personal or social dignity violation, is likely to loom much larger. What I am pointing to here, though, is a harm attached to torture (or being arbitrarily detained, or denied an education, and so forth) that is independent from the harms grounded in our interests in those particular goods. So over and above whatever harm follows from having a particular human right violated, I am positing an additional harm that follows from having a *human right* violated—a harm that is only explicable in terms of the role human rights play in delineating how human beings ought to be treated *qua* human beings. Likewise, being given a number rather than a name will carry all sorts of intrinsic and instrumental costs; but over and above these costs it involves a violation of human dignity, the harms of which center on being treated as less than human. Such treatment communicates to the victim, and to those around them, that they are unworthy of membership in the human community. It thus cuts to the core of how we understand ourselves and our place in the world, and invites others to view us with the utmost disdain.

This leaves the first criterion, and it is not as straightforward as the other two. Here, we need to ask whether recognizing one another as human, and treating one another accordingly, perpetuates or exacerbates the oppression of others. Before directly addressing this question, it is important to first clarify what's at stake. I am not claiming that, if this criterion were not met, a person would have no valid moral claim against, say, being tortured. Rather, what I am trying to identify here are the grounds and scope of moral claims we can make *simply in virtue of being human*. Many of these claims will correlate to claims we can make on the basis of other factors—our susceptibility to pain, say, or our status as autonomous agents. Once those naturalistic factors are bracketed, though, we must only appeal to the significance of membership in the relevant social kind; of membership, that is, in the human kind.[^22] The significance of *that* fact is tempered by the potential harms caused by the maintenance of social kinds, especially when those kinds are oppressive.

As advocates of animal rights such as Peter Singer and Jeff McMahan have been quick to point out, our attachment to the category of the human has to be considered alongside our willingness to treat non-human animals in morally appalling ways.[^23] While this is not the *purpose* of the category of the human, it is nonetheless a potential side effect of that category's increasing prominence. Just as attachment to co-citizens is part of the explanation for people's relative indifference in the face of distant suffering, so too, the argument goes, attachment to co-humans is part of the explanation for people's relative indifference in the face of non-human suffering. To recognize special entitlements simply in virtue of membership in the category "human" is nothing but speciesism, according to Singer and McMahan.

More recently, a similar argument has been raised specifically against the appeals to human dignity in theories of human rights. As Diego Rossello puts the point, we need to "remain vigilant of the political agenda of aristocracy for all, like Waldron's, when it risks turning the human family into new Bourbons or Tudors, at the expense of the underdog of other forms of life" (Rossello 2017, 17). Will Kymlicka is even more explicit about the connection:

> On the one hand, the HR [human rights] project has been characterized by the struggle against the dehumanization of particular groups in society, whether defined by race, gender, ability, or religion....On the other hand, the HR project has also been characterized by ideologies and practices of species hierarchy, and in that respect is complicit in the ongoing moral catastrophe of our relations with non-human animals. (Kymlicka 2018, 763)

For Kymlicka, the human rights project's appeal to human dignity, with its connotations of human supremacy above non-human animals, exacerbates the human tendency to ignore or downplay the significance of animal suffering, and our role in perpetuating it. Importantly, in the context of defending a constructionist account of human dignity, Kymlicka locates the problem within what he calls the "new dignitarian" movement, which he takes to include Jeremy Waldron, George Kateb, and Catherine Dupré. According to Kymlicka, the new dignitarians have shifted away from seeing vulnerability as the core justification for human rights, a theme that was prevalent in the earlier works of theorists such as Henry Shue, Martha Nussbaum, and James Nickel, and towards a focus on human dignity, where that is taken to separate humans from other animals. "In all these cases," Kymlicka claims, "human dignity is defended on the backs of animals" (Kymlicka 2018, 770).

These are not objections that can be easily dismissed, and I don't pretend to offer a full refutation of them here. At the end of the day, if it turns out the human is an oppressive kind, then I concede that it carries no moral weight. However, I hope to provide some reason for optimism about the human kind, at least in its global form, and hence defend the idea that we can make valid moral claims in virtue of our membership in it. The relevant question, to be clear, is not how much harm we do to animals (as important as that question is), but rather whether these harms are *caused* by construing ourselves to be members of the human kind. In other words, it's not a question of the harm humans do to non-human animals *simpliciter*, but rather the harm we do *because* of our attachment to the human kind.

My response to the kinds of concerns raised by Singer, McMahan, Rossello, and Kymlicka turns on the possibility of a gap between attachment to a social kind, and the oppression of non-members—and that this gap can exist even when membership in the social kind carries with it special entitlements. A comparison with a different social kind can help draw out this point. Just like the human, the family is best thought of as a social kind. As we saw above with respect to "parent," while there are natural kinds in the vicinity, the boundaries of "family" cannot plausibly be thought to be tracking human-independent facts of nature, given the wide-ranging cross-cultural differences in where those boundaries are drawn. In many times and places, including my own, being a member of the family has meant greater entitlements: because you're my brother, I ought to take care of your children if you're incapacitated; because you're my mother, I ought to ensure you're looked after in your old age; and so on. Crucially, even though I don't owe non-family members the very same treatment, it doesn't follow that they're thereby oppressed. The norms we internalize about how to treat family members largely operate independently from what we take ourselves to owe non-members. Of course, this isn't necessarily the case—there have undoubtedly been times and places in which the only morally salient category has been the family, with non-members treated appallingly. My point is simply that we cannot assume the enhanced entitlements of members of the human kind explains our willingness to harm non-human animals.

Moreover, the possibility of a privileged category not descending into the oppression of non-members increases if we adopt a constructionist account of that category, since then we are self-consciously acknowledging its contingency. We of course still have to justify the special treatment we choose to accord one another; but that justification will not be grounded in any appeal to innate superiority. Compare this to the situation faced by inner kernel views: precisely because such theories tie human dignity to possession of inherent features, and hence ground claims to special treatment in those features, they presuppose a natural hierarchy between human and non-human animals. At least if we adopt the kind of social constructionist view of human dignity that I have been arguing for here, then, it should be possible to make claims on the basis of our humanity without thereby impugning the moral status of non-human animals.

Even if the worry about treatment of non-human animals is successfully assuaged, though, there is another factor that must be considered in our assessment of the global human kind. The worry here is not about the effect of the human kind on non-human animals, but rather the effect of the global human kind on smaller human communities. More precisely, the worry is that the increasing salience of the global category of the human, both in people's self-understanding and in the workings of global politics, has a homogenizing effect, foreclosing important cultural differences. This is especially salient in the context of human rights practice, where the attempt to ensure that everyone is treated as humans ought to be treated runs the distinct risk of presupposing a single valuable form of life for all humans. The worry, then, is twofold: that increasing attention to the global variant of the human comes to replace other social categories in people's self-understanding; and that the norms attached to membership in the global human kind foreclose other more culturally salient norms.

As with the treatment of non-human animals, there are no simple answers here. Once more, I am committed to the conclusion that if, on the sum of evidence, the global human kind is oppressive, then we cannot make moral claims on the basis of our membership in it (though, to reiterate once more, there are many other grounds from which moral claims could still be made, such as vulnerability to pain, or autonomous capacities). Nonetheless, it seems to me that the balance of evidence, at least for now, speaks in favor of the human kind. The global variant of the human is only likely to loom large in our self-understanding when it is under threat. Otherwise, it largely operates in the background, alongside a multitude of other social identities, including local variants of the human. In addition, while the global human kind entitles all humans to the same forms of treatment, and hence presupposes some common needs and interests, the status is thin enough to function alongside many different forms of life. What it does block are forms of life in which some individuals' lives are deemed expendable, or their human rights are violated, or they are seen as mere tools for the use of others. It is incompatible, that is, with forms of life such as that described in Margaret Atwood's *The Handmaid's Tale*. While the broader issue of cultural relativism is too large to grapple with here, I feel confident asserting that failure to accommodate such forms of life is not oppressive. That said, the thinness of the global human kind is not a settled matter. I have argued above that the content of human rights can—and perhaps ought to—expand, as we demand a richer recognition of our status as humans. In assessing the appropriateness of such demands, attention needs to be paid to the unintended consequences of such enrichment, especially around the issue of protecting cultural difference.

I have tentatively suggested that people have a valid moral claim against having their human dignity violated. This tentativeness is likely to give some readers pause—surely, you might think, we should be aiming for a conception of human dignity that vindicates its moral import, and with it the legitimacy of human rights? I am less sure of that. I do not think we should presuppose that human rights must be an unmitigated good in the world. The worry that our commitment to human rights facilitates the mistreatment of non-human animals, or that it displaces more localized identities, cannot be simply brushed aside. Of course, questioning the practice of human rights is not the same as denying that there are *any* moral rights, which we may possess in virtue of some feature or capacity non-identical to our humanity. I stay completely neutral on that question here. What I have aimed to identify is a possible additional ground for rights, located simply in our membership in the human community. *That* ground, I've suggested, has at least the potential to support valid moral claims, but does not straightforwardly do so.

### 3.2 Frustration and Destruction of Human Dignity

In this closing section, I'll consider the moral import of frustrating or destroying human dignity. To have one's human dignity frustrated is to be denied opportunities to be treated as humans ought to be treated. Since most everyday interactions involve treating one another as humans ought to be treated—recognizing one another as individuals with names; refraining from egregious instrumentalization; refraining from violating one another's human rights—most people's human dignity will not be vulnerable to frustration. Those whose human dignity is most vulnerable to frustration are those who are denied these possibilities of everyday interactions: for instance prisoners (especially those in solitary confinement); or asylum seekers held in offshore detention, such as Australia's camps in Nauru and Manus Island. Here, on the margins of human society, recognition of an individual's humanity is in short supply.

As we saw in Chapter 4, with respect to status dignity more broadly, when someone's membership in a social kind is precarious it is especially important to consolidate it through public displays of recognition respect. Failure to do so can erode an individual's sense of belonging to the community, and simultaneously erode others' sense that she belongs. We need, then, to see marginalized others being treated as human in order to reinforce their membership in the human community, and to reinforce the fact that the norms apply to them, too. To borrow a phrase from Hilde Lindemann (2016), it is vital that we *hold people in their humanity*, which we can do by ensuring they are provided with space and opportunity to have their human dignity publicly affirmed.[^24] This is especially true when it cannot be taken for granted that as a society we *do* acknowledge that these individuals have names, and grievable lives, and human rights—a situation that unfortunately holds with respect both to prisoners and those in off-shore detention.

When we systematically fail to hold people in their humanity, we run the risk of *destroying* their human dignity. To have one's human dignity destroyed is to be excluded from the human kind—it is a form of literal dehumanization. As we saw with status dignity violations, though, our human dignity is not necessarily destroyed if those around us refuse to see us as human. That phenomenon, with all its attendant horrors, is best thought of as a human dignity violation. It is nonetheless possible that the boundaries of the human kind are altered over time so as to exclude some people. Because these boundaries are generated by social norms, they can also be eroded by shifts in those social norms. Systematic denial that certain kinds of people are entitled to be treated as human beings carries the very real threat that the boundaries of the human will shrink to exclude such people. In the Australian context, a most pressing example of this is in the government's treatment of asylum seekers. Time and again, the government refuses to recognize asylum seekers as bearers of human rights, denies through its behavior that the lives of asylum seekers are grievable, and uses the lives of asylum seekers as mere tools to achieve political ends. These are very clear patterns of dehumanization.

Nonetheless, asylum seekers continue to be held in the human community through pockets of domestic resistance, but more importantly through the responses of the international community. As we saw in Section 2 above, the practice of human rights has been instrumental in establishing the boundaries of the human to be coextensive with membership in the natural kind *homo sapiens*. As long as those institutions continue to insist that asylum seekers are human, and hence entitled to human rights, there is hope of holding the line against these attempts at dehumanization. Conversely, however, if human rights practice starts to turn a blind eye to certain kinds of people, it would place immense pressure on the boundaries of the human.

In closing, it is worth reflecting on the metaphilosophical implications of this account of dehumanization. When philosophers debate the boundaries of moral status, they presumably take themselves to be searching for naturalistic moral facts. Nonetheless, those debates can have unintended consequences for the social kind human, including weakening the norms holding certain people within its bounds.[^25] What I have in mind here are the ways in which philosophers have pushed for understandings of moral status such that individuals with significant cognitive impairment are excluded.[^26] The motivations for this move are, philosophically speaking, innocent: to ensure our moral categories are tracking actual moral facts, and to highlight inconsistencies or contradictions in our moral thinking. Examined through the lens of human dignity, however, such discussions take on a much more pernicious cast. By arguing that the lives of individuals with severe cognitive impairments are not grievable, for instance, these philosophical moves put pressure on the membership of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities within the human community.

Were these debates to remain within the cloistered confines of the philosophical seminar room, their ability to actually change the boundaries of the human kind would be slight. When those ideas get picked up and refracted through medical institutions, however, there is less room for complacency. I have highlighted throughout this chapter the role that human rights practice plays in sustaining the human kind, but this should not cause us to overlook the import of other institutions—and medicine is by no means a marginal institution in contemporary life. My account, then, suggests a difficulty for these philosophical debates. While the claims these philosophers are making are intended to refer to the human as a natural kind, it can be very hard to avoid having those claims affect the human as a social kind. In other words, arguing that "allowing severely retarded people to die, and perhaps even killing them, are [. . .] less serious matters than we've believed," as Jeff McMahan has done, actually works to bring about a world in which the lives of individuals with severe cognitive disabilities are less grievable than others. This is not an implication that should be overlooked in considering how such debates ought to proceed.

We—as philosophers, and as members of the human community—have a choice. We can maintain the boundaries of the human where they are, or we can allow them to erode. We can strengthen the claims we make against one another, building a future in which to be human is to be entitled to a life of opportunity and flourishing, or we can retreat from that vision. These are not abstract questions whose answers we can give in a moment's reflection, but practical choices we make every day in how we interact with one another, the language we choose to use in talking about one another, and how we respond to the depredations inflicted on one other. Nothing less than who counts as human, and what it means to be human, depends on what we do.

[^1]: Strictly speaking, these are all examples of *human* kinds. Because talking about the human as a human kind would inevitably become confusing, I'll stick to the terminology of social kinds in this chapter. Any reference to the human kind in this chapter is thus shorthand for "the human as a human kind."
[^2]: Citizen is thus what Ian Hacking has called an "interactive kind" (Hacking 1999, 1995). I say more about the importance of interactive kinds for my account of human dignity below.
[^3]: As Alice Crary (2007, 388) points out, "while it is degrading for a human *qua* human to lack a name, the same cannot be said about animals." Interestingly, Homer's *Odyssey* identifies three traits common to all humans: a need for the Gods, mortality, and *having a name—*for discussion, see (Stuurman 2017, 38).
[^4]: This does not mean that none of the social norms concerning how humans ought to be treated could be given a naturalistic justification; it is just to say that such a naturalistic justification is not necessary. Of course, social norms do require *some* justification, as Chapter 4 argued at length, and as the examples of the treatment of royals is intended to imply. I'll consider the scope of our claims to human dignity in Section 3 below.
[^5]: Thanks to Julian Sempill for pressing me on this point.
[^6]: A caveat is needed here, since human rights are typically *not* taken to extend to fetuses in either human rights discourse or practice. It is in part for this reason that fetuses are not members of the human kind, at least in its global variant. This obviously has significant moral implications, though they go beyond the scope of my current project.
[^7]: Matthew Weinert (2015) develops a similar idea in much more detail. He likewise argues that the human is a social construct, and that we "humanize" one another both through interpersonal conduct and in the operations of our international institutions. Weinert focuses on the latter, exploring the processes within global politics that affirm, and thereby maintain, each human being's humanity.
[^8]: I recognize that there are countless exceptions to this claim, and that it reflects my particular Western educational background—what Richard Rorty (1993) would describe as having undergone a process of "sentimental education." To reiterate, though, my claim is not that these global norms are universally accepted, but that they are *hegemonic*. Pointing out that these ideas are manifestly *liberal* commitments does not counter the claim that they are global, given the cultural and political dominance of liberalism as an ideology in the world today. I consider the implications of this fact for the normativity of human dignity below.
[^9]: Ásta distinguishes between what she calls "institutional" properties, and what she calls "communal" properties. Institutional properties are conferred (as the name suggests) in formal institutional contexts, whereas communal properties are conferred through more ephemeral and context-sensitive social practices. I'll focus here on the communal variant, both because it is the more challenging for a human kinds theory (and hence its applicability is all the more striking), and because the institutional variant is much closer to the Searlean account we have already considered.
[^10]: Here my Ásta-inspired account of the human may potentially depart from what Ásta herself is committed to, since in all of the examples Ásta considers of conferring communal properties, the relevant context is a face-to-face one.
[^11]: See, e.g., "The Great Ape Project," http://www.projetogap.org.br/en/.
[^12]: See, e.g., (Gewirth 1981, Gilabert 2015, Griffin 2008, Tasioulas 2009). It should be noted that even orthodox views will typically appeal to more than purely moral considerations. Griffin, for instance, supplements his personhood approach with what he calls "practicalities."
[^13]: See., e.g., (Beitz 2009, Buchanan 2013, Rawls 2001, Raz 2010, Rorty 1993).
[^14]: There is some overlap here with how Laura Valentini (2017) construes the relevant sense of human dignity. She argues that we have human rights in virtue of our *status dignity*, where that picks out our status as subjects of political authority, to whom normative standards of treatment are thereby owed. While I agree that we have human dignity because of our membership in a socially constructed category, I disagree that it is being subject to political authority that determines why and how we have human dignity.
[^15]: Orthodox approaches could dodge this problem if they took the practice to be distinct from, and unaccountable to, what moral human rights there really are. Such a move would, however, undermine the relevance of orthodox theories.
[^16]: This implication could be resisted if a foundationalist theory incorporated distributive equality as part of the grounds for human rights. To the best of my knowledge no foundationalist approaches make this move, and Griffin, in particular, is highly resistant to it (Griffin 2008, 39–44). The foundationalist who comes closest is Gilabert (Gilabert 2019), who both centers solidarity in his theory, and leans on a distinction between status dignity and condition dignity, in order to argue for quite a progressive understanding of human rights.
[^17]: Here I am in partial agreement with Jeremy Waldron: "To say of a being that it has the status of human dignity is certainly to imply that it has human rights. But that is because human dignity as a status term is just a short way of conveying that information. Like every other status term, it abbreviates a list of rights. We don't have human rights because we have human dignity; our having human dignity is our having human rights" (Waldron 2015, 134–5). Where I part ways with Waldron is in seeing our status of human dignity as *exhausted* by human rights; I think what we are owed *qua* human dignity also encompasses more ephemeral norms of treatment. In addition, and in my view unfortunately, by the end of this paper Waldron has pulled back from this view of human dignity as a status, and ends up endorsing something much closer to an inner kernel conception of human dignity.

[^19]: Cf. (Feinberg 1970), whose example of "Nowheresville" is intended to draw out the importance of understanding oneself as having the standing to make rights claims.
[^20]: Cf. (Donnelly 2013): "The relationship between human nature, human rights, and political society is 'dialectical.' Human rights shape political society, so as to shape human beings, so as to realize the possibilities of human nature, which provided the basis for these rights in the first place" (p. 16).
[^21]: When considering which norms ground valid moral claims, it is also worth stressing that the global human kind, which has been the focus of my discussion, is not the only human kind in town. The norms attached to the global human kind will necessarily be somewhat thin given the requirement that they have global reach. We must not forget, however, that local communities can also produce their own human kinds, with their own much richer norms of treatment. Making demands on the basis of *those* norms is no less valid than making demands based on the norms of the global variant, provided the other two criteria are satisfied.
[^22]: So for instance, we might ask whether and why it is wrong to torture an individual who is in a permanent vegetative state, and hence who (let's stipulate) does not experience pain and is not an autonomous agent. What makes such an act wrong, I claim, is that the individual is still human, and to fail to treat them accordingly denigrates them.

[^24]: Lindemann is concerned with holding one another in *personhood*, rather than humanity, and thus she is concerned with the ways in which elements of personal identity—values, memories, and so forth—are socially maintained.
[^25]: Anne Phillips (2015, 20) puts this point well. "When we speak the language of the human," she says, "we engage in a politics of inclusion; yet in offering our definitions of this human, we endorse something that serves to exclude."
