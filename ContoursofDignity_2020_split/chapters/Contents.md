## Acknowledgments

**윗단락앞에서페이지변경**

The ideas developed in this book have been percolating for a number of years, and I have accumulated numerous debts to colleagues, interlocutors, and friends along the way.

I owe special thanks to those who provided feedback on all or parts of the manuscript: Paul Formosa, Karen Jones, Paul O'Halloran, Louise Richardson-Self, and Michael Smith, who were kind enough to present at a workshop on the full manuscript; Kerstin Knight, Matthew Lister, Julian Sempill, Dave Shoemaker, and Nate Stout, who all provided helpful written comments; and the readers for OUP, whose suggestions have undoubtedly improved the final product.

I've benefitted immensely from being able to present my ideas to philosophical audiences around the world. Thanks to the organizers and audiences at the Australasian Association of Philosophy Conferences; the Melbourne Legal Theory Workshop; the Tennessee Values and Agency Conference; the Revisiting Richard Rorty Conference in Braga; the Australasian Workshop in Moral Philosophy at Kioloa; the Dignity, Respect, and Self-Respect Conference in Bologna; the Dignity Workshop at Monash; and the Visions of Humanity Conference in Berlin. Thanks, too, to the organizers and audiences for colloquia at the University of Western Australia, the University of Sydney, the Australian National University, Massey University, the University of Melbourne, CAPPE Canberra, and Groningen University.

Special thanks also to my colleagues at the University of Connecticut, where I started work on this manuscript, and Monash University, where I finished it.

I was especially fortunate to receive a Fellowship with the Murphy Institute, at Tulane University, which provided a wonderful environment to think and write—thanks to everyone in the Institute and the philosophy department there for being wonderful hosts, and especially to my fellow Fellows, Nick Zangwill and Chris Heathwood, for a memorable semester.

Since I do most of my writing in cafes, thanks are also due to the friendly staff at Orange Couch and Flora Cafes in New Orleans, and at Sun Moth in Melbourne—thanks for the coffee, and for putting up with me tapping away in a corner!

Last, but by no means least, I owe thanks to my family for their love and support over the years—I know you might not think of yourselves as especially dignified, but if you ever manage to wade through this book I hope you'll come to see that you most certainly are!

And to Dave. Every day you make me a better philosopher; but more importantly a better person. Thanks can't express my gratitude for having you in my life.
