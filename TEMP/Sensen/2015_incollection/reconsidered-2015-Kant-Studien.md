  This article responds to critiques of Sensen's interpretation of Kant's concept of human dignity. Sensen argues against the prevalent view that respect for others is based on their inherent value, proposing instead that Kant's justification is rooted in an a priori law of reason. The paper clarifies Kant's conception of value as a prescription of reason and discusses the implications for understanding dignity and moral imperatives.

# Oliver Sensen *Kant on Human Dignity* **reconsidered**

#### A reply to my critics

**Abstract:** The justification for Kant's dictum to treat oneself and others never merely as a means can be read in very different ways. In this article I respond to comments made by Dieter Schönecker, Jochen Bojanowski, Heiner Klemme and Stefano Bacin on the justification I offer in my book *Kant on Human Dignity*. In the book I argue against the most popular reading of Kant's justification, which tries to base the respect one owes to others on a value they possess. In contrast, my view ties Kant's justification more closely to his theoretical philosophy, and argues that it is based on an a priori law. In my response I clarify several points I made in the book: I spell out how Kant conceives of value as a prescription of reason, why value cannot be the foundation of Kant's moral philosophy as well as whether it needs a special end to motivate moral actions, and what Kant means by 'end in itself.' In this article I also enlarge upon the positive account of why one should respect others, and how Kant conceives of this requirement to be based in pure reason. Finally, I offer a modified reading of the traditional paradigm of dignity to which Kant also adheres. Unlike the account I give in the book, I do not believe any longer that in this conception dignity is always connected to a duty to oneself, and I grant that this conception has often been used as an intuitively plausible but incomplete shorthand argument for the requirement to respect others.

Kant's dictum to treat oneself and others never merely as a means, but always at the same time as an end (cf. GMS, AA 04: 429.10–12) is a powerful moral idea. It implies that all human beings should be respected, independently of birth, gender, race or wealth; even a criminal should be respected as a human being (cf. MS, AA

06: 463.15–21).¹ However, Kant's justification for *why* one should respect others can be read in very different ways. In my book, *Kant on Human Dignity* [KoHD] (Berlin/Boston 2011), I argue against the most popular reading of Kant's justification, which tries to base the respect one owes to others on a value they possess. My view ties Kant's justification more closely to his theoretical philosophy, and argues that it is based on an a priori law. Going against the popular view, it is not surprising that my interpretation is controversial. But I am grateful to find that my argument has provoked not mere controversy, but real interest and engagement by outstanding Kant scholars, who have offered thoughtful challenges to my reading. I want to thank Heiner Klemme for organizing a symposium on the book at the Kant Research Center at Mainz University, the editors at *Kant-Studien*  for publishing the exchange based on this symposium, and Dieter Schönecker, Jochen Bojanowski, Heiner Klemme and Stefano Bacin for their rich and deep comments on my book. Their criticisms raise the central objections to my account, and I am grateful for the opportunity to clarify some points, expand upon others, but also modify my account of human dignity.

I have structured the replies to my commentators around topics, rather than responding to each critic in turn, since the commentators often write on the same theme. It was tempting to point out every little issue on which I disagree, but I am more interested in the key question of whether the points the critics make refute my interpretation of Kant's account of human dignity. In ordering the topics of my reply, I follow more or less the order of my book. In the book I tried to begin from the position the reader would expect Kant to hold: that 'dignity' is the name for a value property that grounds rights and commands respect. In the book I present the case that Kant does not have such a conception of value, and that he does not ground morality on any value. I argue that Kant – even in the famous passages where he contrasts dignity and price – instead uses an older paradigm of dignity, according to which 'dignity' expresses that something is raised above something else. In this reply to my critics, I will first discuss how Kant conceives of value (Section 1), and why I do not think that Kant sees value as the foundation of morality (Section 2). I shall then – more clearly than in the book – spell out Kant's positive justification of morality (Section 3), and address the challenging question of whether this can account for moral motivation and Kant's conception of ends in themselves (Section 4). Finally, I will address the challenges the critics make to my reading of dignity proper (Section 5).

## **1 Kant's Conception of Value**

Three of the commentators, Schönecker, Bojanowski and Klemme, question my reading of Kant's account of value. I argue that Kant does not conceive of value statements (i) as referring to a metaphysical feature of being precious, nor (ii) do value statements express that one is valuing something, but that (iii) value statements are a different way of saying what reason cognizes as necessary: "which reason independently of inclination cognizes as practically necessary, that is, as good"² (GMS, AA 04: 412.33–35). A statement of what is *absolutely* valuable expresses what reason deems necessary "in every respect and without any further condition" ["in aller Absicht und ohne weitere Bedingung"] (KpV, AA 05: 60.21 f.). As this judgment is not conditioned, it is based on a categorical imperative. Kant says that absolute value is something one can only give oneself in acting in accordance with the imperative for its own sake (cf. KU, AA 05: 208.35– 209.01; 443.04–13), i.e., in having a good will (cf. GMS, AA 04: 393.05–07; 426.07– 12; 437.05–09). As such, 'absolute value' can only be predicated of actions or the moral quality of a will (cf. KpV, AA 05: 60.19–25).

Dieter Schönecker questions whether my interpretation of Kant's account of value is really different from the metaphysical understanding of value I reject (pp. 70, 72). After all, on my account, Kant's Categorical Imperative (cf. GMS, AA 04: 421.18–20) is the law of freedom, and freedom seems to be a metaphysical property too (cf. p. 72). Furthermore, scholars who read Kant as a value realist, Schönecker alleges, hold that human beings are valuable in virtue of autonomy, i.e., because they have freedom that can be guided by the Categorical Imperative. So, these value realists would not hold that human beings have value independently of the Categorical Imperative.³ Is my account even different from the one I reject?

What distinguishes my view is that freedom – while being a metaphysical property – is not by itself a *precious* property or a value. To have freedom or reason is a metaphysical property, but this by itself does not explain what is valuable about it. In Schönecker's example, if one person is taller than another, the relational property of being taller is based on an intrinsic metaphysical property, the height of the taller person (cf. p. 75). However, my point is that neither the height of the person nor that he is taller are moral properties. By itself they do

**<sup>2</sup>** "[…] was die Vernunft, unabhängig von der Neigung als praktisch nothwendig, d. i. als gut, erkennt."

**<sup>3</sup>** I disagree with Schönecker's estimate of the literature that everyone grounds the value of human beings on the Categorical Imperative (p. 70); for references to the contrary see KoHD 11 f.

not generate any moral duties. Kant gives the example of Robinson Crusoe: If you are stranded on an island, but you realize that there are other people who have freedom or reason, your first reaction is to be afraid of them. You can predict how an animal will behave, but not a free human being (cf. V-NR/Feyerabend, AA 27: 1320.16–29). Further steps are needed to argue that possessing freedom or reason is valuable or should be respected. One option is to argue that there is a nonnatural value property supervening upon the possession of freedom or reason (cf. KoHD 14–16, 147–149). A (non-natural) value realist could also conceive of value as a separate substance or a Platonic form, but to generate any duties, value would be a distinct metaphysical preciousness.

Schönecker could respond that on my conception too there is something precious: the Categorical Imperative. However, I would argue that a value and an imperative function differently. I do not regard the imperative as something precious in me or others that I need to respect and further. Rather it expresses an ought and commands directly. Many things can be good, but only one thing is commanded as right or an ought (cf. MS, AA 06: 224.09–26). The Categorical Imperative expresses an unconditional ought commanded by reason, and is not a value which I still need to weigh against others.

Jochen Bojanowski agrees with me that value is not a foundational concept for Kant, and that the Categorical Imperative is the source of moral demands (cf. pp. 79–82). He also agrees that value is nothing that could be discovered with a non-natural intuition in the sense that is often attributed to G. E. Moore. Yet he argues that this does not rule out that Kant conceives of value as a metaphysical property. Bojanowski's textual argument is that, on Kant's account, practical cognition brings objects into existence, and the object of pure practical reason is the good (cf. pp. 81, 86). Consequently, a good will and good actions both have a metaphysical value property that results from the Categorical Imperative, but that is nonetheless metaphysically real. Bojanowski then challenges my reading on two fronts: First, my categorization of value as – to simplify it here – (i) a metaphysical feature, (ii) something we do value, (iii) something we should value, would not be exhaustive; and, second, he asks why value could not be a metaphysical feature on Kant's account.

Regarding the first challenge, whether my three-fold categorization of value is exhaustive, there actually seems to me to be less disagreement than might at first appear. This is because I am not committed to the view that distinct metaphysical value properties would exist independently of the mind (cf. p. 80), nor am I committed to the view that this value would have to be discoverable by a Moorean non-natural intuition (cf. p. 79). If one were to hold that the only thing that has absolute value is the human mind, then a metaphysical value property might supervene upon the mind. Without a human mind, there would be no value (cf. KoHD 15). Conversely, Bojanowski's view is distinctive in that he regards a good will and good actions as the bearer of value, and not freedom, reason, or the capacity to set ends. But this leaves open the question of what exactly value is: Is it (i) a metaphysical property, (ii) something we do value, or (iii) something we should value? Bojanowski's view would be an instance of (i), and therefore his view would not fall outside my classification.

But why do I not, to address the second challenge, believe that value could be a distinct metaphysical property, according to Kant? The problem is posed by Kant's theoretical philosophy: How could one discern such a property? According to Kant, all knowledge begins with the senses (cf. KrV, B 1), and "we cannot cook up […] a single object with any new and not empirically given property."⁴ Why would one be warranted in postulating such a property, since "merely intelligible properties of things of the sensible world cannot be assumed"⁵ (KrV, A 772/ B 800), and "hyperphysical ones can never be permitted at all"⁶ (KrV, A 773/ B 801). However, Bojanowski postulates exactly such properties. He could respond that one might reason or feel one's way to the knowledge of such a property: "in knowing practically our cognition affects us through the feeling of respect for the moral law. And the good is realized in that action." (p. 81) But I think that the burden of proof is on Bojanowski to show why this does not violate the restrictions of Kant's theoretical philosophy, and how one gets from the feeling of respect to the existence of a metaphysical value property. I do not see that his textual argument accomplishes this because in the argument Bojanowski switches from 'practical cognition' to 'object of pure reason,' and it is not clear that those two are the same. On my view, Kant does not invoke a metaphysical value property when he specifies what a morally good will consist in, but such a will "consists just in the principle of action being free from all influences of contingent grounds"⁷ (GMS, AA 04: 426.10–12, cf. 437.05–09). Why does it need an additional metaphysical value property?

Heiner Klemme also agrees with me that value is not a foundational notion for Kant (cf. note 5), and he also agrees that it is not a distinct metaphysical property (cf. p. 93). On his reading, values are "ways of preferring [*Weisen des Vorzie-*

**<sup>4</sup>** "[…] so können wir nicht einen einzigen Gegenstand nach einer neuen und empirisch nicht anzugebenden Beschaffenheit […] ursprünglich aussinnen" (KrV, A 770/B 798; similarly A 254/B 309). **5** "[…] bloß intelligibele Eigenschaften der Dinge der Sinnenwelt, lassen sich mit keiner gegründeten Befugniß der Vernunft […] annehmen […]."

**<sup>6</sup>** "[…] sich allenfalls hyperphysischer [Hypothesen] zu bedienen, kann gar nicht gestattet werden […]."

**<sup>7</sup>** "[…] eben darin besteht, daß das Princip der Handlung von allen Einflüssen zufälliger Gründe […] frei sei."

*hens*]" (p. 93). The existence of human beings has an absolute value, on Klemme's account, because rational beings necessarily value the existence of their own rational nature above all else (cf. p. 91). Klemme and I therefore seem to agree on what value is, according to Kant. It is not a distinct metaphysical property, and it is not an empirical description of what people do value, but something they *necessarily* value, and therefore should value. However, I believe that Kant does not regard one's own existence as something one necessarily values by reason. I grant that he regards one's own existence as a universal end, but this is an end which our animal nature sets for us (cf. MS, AA 06: 420.04 f.), not an end of our pure reason. The end of our pure reason is one's own perfection and the happiness of others (cf. MS, AA 06: 386.18–388.30), or to act in accordance with moral commands. Even the scoundrel wishes to be moral in this sense (cf. GMS, AA 04: 454.21–27). Klemme could respond that his account of valuing is needed in order to explain how pure reason can determine itself (cf. p. 89 f.), and I shall address this view in section 4 below. I first want to discuss whether value could be the foundation of morality, according to Kant.

### **2 Value and the foundation of morality**

On the nature of value Klemme and Bojanowski read Kant differently than I do, but they agree with me that value is not the foundation of morality, according to Kant. Dieter Schönecker, by contrast, contests that point. In the book I gave three main reasons why Kant does not regard value as the foundation of morality: (1) Kant elucidates value as something that is dependent upon the moral law; it therefore cannot be the ground of it, as I discussed in the previous section. (2) Kant argues directly that value cannot be the foundation of morality. (3) He does not refer to value whenever he explicitly addresses the issue of moral justification (cf. KoHD ch. 1). In this section I shall respond to Schönecker's criticisms of points (2) and (3). I am grateful for his sharp and helpful comments, especially when he points out that my view of value as not being 'prior to and independent of the moral law' is ambiguous. It could be that the moral law itself is valuable (cf. p. 70). In the last section I argued that Kant does not regard value as independent, i.e., an additional supervening property; in the following I shall argue that value is not the foundation of morality, and that in the order of justification, Kant does not regard value as prior to the moral law.

(2): In the *Critique of Practical Reason* Kant presents an argument for the view that value cannot be the foundation for the a priori Categorical Imperative. The argument begins with the assumption: "Suppose that we wanted to begin with the concept of the good in order to derive from it laws of the will"⁸ (KpV, AA 05: 63.11 f.), and he concludes: "the possibility of a priori practical laws would be at once excluded"⁹ (KpV, AA 05: 63.36 f.). The argument is the support for Kant's assertion that:

> This is the place to explain the paradox of method in a *Critique of Practical Reason, namely, that the concept of good and evil must not be determined before the moral law (for which, as it would seem, this concept would have to be made the basis) but only (as was done here) after it and by means of it*¹⁰ (KpV, AA 05: 62.36–63.04).

Schönecker does not question the validity of Kant's argument, but the scope. He presents three considerations that aim to show that the argument does not rule out that value could be the foundation of morality:

(2.1): Schönecker's first assertion is that the paradox of method merely rejects conceptions of the good which rest on pleasure, not every conception of the good (cf. p. 70). However, this view seems to me to be hard to defend. For, first, prior to the paradox of method Kant presents a different argument to the effect that every conception of the good has to depend on the moral law: For "[i]f the concept of the good is not to be derived from an antecedent practical law,"¹¹ then the good would be "always only good *for something*"¹² (cf. KpV, AA 05: 58.10–59.04 f.).¹³ Second, Kant's argument supports the paradox *of method*. He is not merely rejecting sensual pleasure as the foundation of morality, but addresses the "method of ultimate moral investigations" ["Methode der obersten moralischen Untersuchungen"] (KpV, AA 05: 64.06 f.). He talks about "all the errors of philosophers" and repeats that "they should first have searched for a law that determined the will a priori and immediately," for otherwise "their principle was in every case heteronomy"¹⁴

**12** "immer nur *irgend wozu* Gutes".

**<sup>8</sup>** "Gesetzt, wir wollten nun vom Begriffe des Guten anfangen, um davon die Gesetze des Willens abzuleiten […]."

**<sup>9</sup>** "[…] so hatte man sich die Möglichkeit, ein reines praktisches Gesetz auch nur zu denken, schon zum voraus benommen […]."

**<sup>10</sup>** "Hier ist nun der Ort, das Paradoxon der Methode in einer Kritik der praktischen Vernunft zu erklären: *daß nämlich der Begriff des Guten und Bösen nicht vor dem moralischen Gesetze (dem er dem Anschein nach sogar zum Grunde gelegt werden müßte), sondern nur (wie hier auch geschieht) nach demselben und durch dasselbe bestimmt werden müsse.*"

**<sup>11</sup>** "Wenn der Begriff des Guten nicht von einem vorhergehenden praktischen Gesetze abgeleitet werden […] soll […]."

**<sup>13</sup>** For the details of the argument see KoHD 18–23.

**<sup>14</sup>** "[… Grund] alle[r] Verirrungen der Philosophen" – "daß sie zuerst nach einem Gesetze hätten forschen sollen, das *a priori* und unmittelbar den Willen […] bestimmte" – "so war ihr Grundsatz allemal Heteronomie […]."

(KpV, AA 05: 64.08–18). This echoes Kant's repeated discussion that *all* theories other than his own would yield heteronomy (cf. GMS, AA 04: 441.01–444.34; KpV, AA 05: 39.05–41.37).¹⁵ In one parallel passage, the lecture notes Mrongovius II, Kant reemphasizes that his point is not merely limited to accounts of pleasure. There he asks: "What, then, is the basis of morality?"¹⁶ (V-Mo/Mron II, AA 29: 620.39) Third, in the 'Introduction' to the *Critique of Practical Reason*, Kant already gives greater significance to the whole chapter in which the paradox of method appears (cf. KpV, AA 05: 16.13–36). There Kant emphasizes the parallels and differences between the first and second *Critique*: While the first Critique starts from sensibility and ends with principles, the second Critique starts from principle (ch. 1), goes *from there* to its object (ch. 2), and then to sensibility (ch. 3). The paradox of method is then, as Kant says, about the ultimate method of moral investigation, not just a rejection of one candidate, but a point about the justification of morality simply. And the point is that value cannot be the foundation.

(2.2): A second consideration with which Schönecker tries to limit the scope of the paradox of method is that Kant would allow another conception of the good besides the one discussed in the paradox (cf. p. 71). However, in Kant's text this good is said to be a form of well-being (*Wohl*), and not a distinct metaphysical value property of human beings that could ground human rights (cf. KpV, AA 05: 59.24–62.10). Furthermore, this passage appears before the paradox of method and is not a part of it.

(2.3): Finally, Schönecker presents a third consideration against the scope of the paradox of method. He argues that apart from sensual feelings of pleasure there is also a moral feeling of pleasure, the feeling of respect, and that this feeling is a way of cognizing (cf. p. 71). The heart of the paradox of method – to summarize my interpretation (cf. KoHD, 23–27) – is the claim that any realist value property would have to be discovered by the senses, and that if there is no nonsensible intuition, nor a discovery of the property with one's five senses, then the only way one could recognize value properties is a feeling of pleasure. Feelings, however, are relative and contingent, and cannot ground a necessary moral law. So Schönecker is right that if there is another way of cognizing, a feeling of respect, then the paradox of method does not rule out the knowledge of realist value properties.

However, it is not clear that anything is gained by emphasizing the feeling of respect. What is at issue, to repeat, is whether one can discover a metaphysi-

**<sup>15</sup>** I try to spell out Kant's argument in my: "Moral Obligation and Free Will". In: *Kant's* Lectures on Ethics. *A Critical Guide*. Ed. by Lara Denis and Oliver Sensen. Cambridge, forthcoming. **16** "Worauf beruht denn Sittlichkeit?"

cal value property that grounds morality. But if one conceives of the feeling of respect as a sensual feeling, an emotional upheaval of some sort, then it is not clear why this feeling would cognize a metaphysical property on the one hand; nor, on the other hand, is it clear whether it could ground a necessary and universal moral law, as this feeling would be as relative and contingent as any other feeling. Schönecker grants that the feeling does not ground or discover morality (cf. p. 71), but he holds that it lets one discover that one is obliged to follow the moral law. Kant famously says that without moral feeling one would be "morally dead" ["sittlich todt"] (MS, AA 06: 400.11). While it is debatable whether Kant conceives of respect itself as being a sensual feeling,¹⁷ I grant Schönecker that the moral feeling is important for realizing obligation. However, this granted, it is not clear why it should support the view that Kant's moral philosophy is grounded on a value.

Similarly, Schönecker has convinced me that Kant assigns some cognizing role to the feeling of respect. But again this is nothing that supports the view at issue, regarding the grounding of morality: Kant says that one can cognize the purity of one's motives by a feeling of respect (cf. KpV, AA 05: 91.33–92.17). However, this does not discover a metaphysical value property which grounds morality, but this feeling tracks whether one follows the Categorical Imperative for its own sake. It is this capacity that Kant ascribes even to children of moderate age (cf. KpV, AA 05: 155.12–157.21). Schönecker's emphasis on the feeling of respect therefore points to my view of the importance of the Categorical Imperative.¹⁸

(3.) So, I do not agree with Schönecker that the paradox of method is limited in scope in the way he argues. But Schönecker also attacks my third argument: that Kant never refers to value whenever he aims to justify moral requirements (cf. p. 70). Schönecker argues that value does play the crucial role in the justification of morality in the third section of the *Groundwork* (cf. pp. 74–76). At first glance, his charge that I do not pay enough attention to the third section of the *Groundwork* is surprising. For Schönecker himself holds that the position he finds there is inconsistent with Kant's theoretical philosophy, and that Kant replaced it in the second *Critique*.¹⁹ However, maybe there is an argument for a foundational value property in *Groundwork* III, even if Kant later gave it up. So what is the objection?

**<sup>17</sup>** Cf. my: "The Role of Feelings in Kant's Moral Philosophy". In: *Studi Kantiani* 25, 2012, 45–58. **18** Schönecker refers to a forthcoming article for a further role of respect in cognition (cf. note 2). For my alternative reading of the role of feelings in conscience see my forthcoming article: "Kants Begriff des Gewissens" in a collection edited by Katerina Mihaylova and Simon Bunke.

**<sup>19</sup>** Cf. Schönecker, Dieter/Wood, Allen: *Immanuel Kant. "Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten*.*" Ein einführender Kommentar.* Paderborn 2003, 203–205.

Schönecker points out that in the third section of the *Groundwork* Kant justifies the validity of the Categorical Imperative in that the imperative "arose from our will as intelligence and so from our proper self; *but what belongs to mere appearance is necessarily subordinated by reason to the constitution of the thing in itself*"²⁰ (GMS, AA 04: 461.03–06). This subordination, Schönecker alleges, is a value term which justifies the Categorical Imperative. He calls it the "*ontoethischen Grundsatz*" (the 'ontoethical principle' cf. Schönecker/Wood 2003, 197).

I have several reservations against this reading, but I can only be brief here.²¹ On the one hand, the 'ontoethical principle' is limited in its significance since it does not justify the existence of the Categorical Imperative, and, on the other, it does not put forth a metaphysical value. The thesis is limited and not the basis of the Categorical Imperative for four reasons: First, the ontoethical principle does not address the *existence* of the imperative, "whether there really is such an imperative" ["daß dergleichen Imperativ wirklich stattfinde"] (GMS, AA 04: 425.08 f.), but only the question: "But why, then, ought I to subject myself to this principle […]?" ["Warum aber soll ich mich denn diesem Princip unterwerfen […]?"] (GMS, AA 04: 449.11 f.). The thesis answers a question of motivation. Second, the thesis therefore does not answer the question Kant poses in *Groundwork* AA 04: 429.02 of what the ground of the imperative is. There he addresses the question of the existence of the law (cf. GMS, AA 04: 426.22–25). Third, as such the ontoethical principle does not address why one should respect *others*, but merely why *I myself* should follow the law. Fourth, Kant does not utilize the ontoethical principle in the *Critique of Practical Reason*, and it is therefore possible that he himself has abandoned it.

But more importantly, the ontoethical principle does not argue for a metaphysical value property all human beings possess. Rather it talks about what "*is necessarily subordinated by reason*" ["*Was aber zur bloßen Erscheinung gehört, wird von der Vernunft nothwendig* […] *untergeordnet*"] (GMS, AA 04: 461.05 f.). This is different from affirming a value property in two respects. First: not every form of subordination relies on a moral value. One might subordinate something in terms of truth, beauty or purity, to name just a few. For instance, one painting might be more beautiful than another, but *by itself* this does not generate any moral obligation. Kant first introduces the conception of subordination in connection with the

**<sup>20</sup>** "[…] aus unserem eigentlichen Selbst entsprungen ist; *was aber zur Erscheinung gehört, wird von der Vernunft nothwendig der Beschaffenheit der Sache an sich selbst untergeordnet*."

**<sup>21</sup>** For a fuller account see my: "Kants Begründung des Kategorischen Imperativs". In: *Kants Begründung von Freiheit und Moral in* Grundlegung *III*. Ed. by Dieter Schönecker. Paderborn 2014, 233–249.

superiority of a thing as it is in itself in comparison with its appearance (cf. GMS, AA 04: 450.35–452.06). In this context it is not a moral distinction, otherwise everything as it is in itself – a pencil, a table or stone – would have absolute moral value. But, secondly, Kant explains what *reason subordinates*. He talks about an act of reason, something one's own reason does, not a metaphysical value property. Against Schönecker, the ontoethical principle in *Groundwork* III is no objection to my interpretation.²²

## **3 Kant's Constitutivism**

As Bojanowski (pp. 81 f.) and Schönecker (p. 74) rightly point out, in the book I do not fully elaborate or defend Kant's positive account of why one should respect others. Rather I merely sketch what I take such an account to be (cf. KoHD, 113– 118). The reason is that I started writing the book under the assumption that Kant conceives of dignity in the contemporary sense as a value that grounds human rights. The book focuses on the working through, and ultimately the rejection of that view, but not yet the positive account. The result of the book was therefore mainly negative, and resulted in a dilemma: If one wants to defend the contemporary conception of dignity, Kant does not provide the justification for it, and if one wants to follow Kant, one finds support for a different idea. It is only since then that I started to spell out Kant's positive account in a series of articles.²³

Bojanowski asks how one would defend and classify the position I attribute to Kant (cf. pp. 81 f.). On my view, Kant grounds morality on a direct command of pure reason: "Pure reason […] gives (to the human being) a universal law which we call the *moral law*."²⁴ (KpV, AA 05: 31.36 f.) Parallel to Kant's theoretical philosophy, the highest moral principle is something "our own cognitive faculty […] provides out of itself"²⁵ (KrV, B 2) As such the moral law is an "a priori proposi-

**<sup>22</sup>** Schönecker adds that value would play an important role in Kant's discussion of the scoundrel in *Groundwork* III (cf. p. 76). However, this passage (GMS, AA 04: 454.21–26) refers to the value of a good will, not the a value all human beings possess.

tion that is not based on any intuition, either pure or empirical"²⁶ (KpV, AA 05: 31.27 f.) Kant argues that the moral law – and this includes the requirement to respect others – has to be a priori because of its necessity and universality: "This principle of humanity […] is not borrowed from experience […] because of its universality […] so that the principle must arise from pure reason."²⁷ (GMS, AA 04: 430.28–431.09) Universality can only be achieved a priori: "Necessity and strict universality are […] secure indications of an *a priori* cognition"²⁸ (KrV, B 4). The imperative to respect others needs to be a priori too. This does not mean that the principle is innate. An innate principle that is given by God or – one can add – by evolution would not have the strict necessity since another law could have been given or gained during the process of evolution (cf. KrV, B 167 f.). Instead, the moral law has to be conceived of as "initially acquired" ["ursprüngliche Erwerbung"] (ÜE, AA 08: 221.29). If one is prompted to reason morally, one's reason "with complete spontaneity […] makes its own order according to ideas […] according to which it even declares actions to be necessary"²⁹ (KrV, A 548/ B 576).³⁰

Kant does not claim to spell out the mechanism of how and why reason prescribes this a priori law: "all human insight is at an end as soon as we have arrived at basic powers or basic faculties"³¹ (KpV, AA 05: 46.37–47.01). But one can identify that it is a priori and not a command of sensibility by using the criterion of necessity or strict universality: "We can become aware of pure practical laws just as we are aware of pure theoretical principles, by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes them to us"³² (KpV, AA 05: 30.04–07). Kant tries to demonstrate the necessity with one version of the gallows example: A prince demands that you give false testimony against a man whom you know to be innocent. If you refuse, you will lose your life on the gallows. Kant's point is not to

**<sup>26</sup>** "[…] Satz *a priori*, der auf keiner, weder reinen noch empirischen, Anschauung gegründet ist […]."

**<sup>27</sup>** "Dieses Princip der Menschheit […] ist nicht aus der Erfahrung entlehnt: […] wegen seiner Allgemeinheit […] mithin es aus reiner Vernunft entspringen muß."

**<sup>28</sup>** "Nothwendigkeit und strenge Allgemeinheit sind also sichere Kennzeichen einer Erkenntniß *a priori* […]."

**<sup>29</sup>** "[Vernunft …] macht sich mit völliger Spontaneität eine einge Ordnung nach Ideen […] nach denen sie sogar Handlungen für nothwendig erklärt […]."

**<sup>30</sup>** For a fuller defense of this view cf. my 2013 (note 23).

**<sup>31</sup>** "Nun ist aber alle menschliche Einsicht zu Ende, so bald wir zu Grundkräften oder Grundvermögen gelangt sind […]."

**<sup>32</sup>** "Wir können uns reiner praktischer Gesetze bewußt werden, eben so wie wir uns reiner theore tischer Grundsätze bewußt sind, indem wir auf die Nothwendigkeit, womit sie uns die Vernunft vorschreibt […] Acht haben."

explain a past action, and so he can construe the example in a way that no inclination speaks in favor of refusing: One does not believe in an afterlife, there is no hope of a reward or revolution etc. Nonetheless, one's pure reason judges the action to be morally wrong – the man is innocent after all. One realizes that one could act freely, independently of one's inclinations, and the moral law is the descriptive law of freedom (cf. KpV, AA 05: 29.12 f., 30.38 f.).

Bojanowski also wonders how one should classify the position I attribute to Kant, and in particular whether it is different from the view of Korsgaard, who argues that the requirement of universalization is constitutive of rational willing (cf. p. 82 f.). Our views seem indeed to be similar, yet as far as I can see there are important differences. Korsgaard's point seems to be that an action which is not universalizable does not count as an action at all. She gives an analogy with the principle of contradiction.³³ If your thoughts run in contradictions, they do not count as rational thinking. The law of contradiction is constitutive of what rational thinking is. Similarly, Korsgaard argues, the moral law is the constitutive law of rational willing. However, the willing Korsgaard is concerned with is an empirical willing, such as an intention to help others or to cheat on one's taxes. One should will universally in order to constitute oneself as an agent; for otherwise one's behavior would be a mere heap of inclinations. But since one cannot avoid behaving in some way, one has to will universally *if* one does not want to be a mere heap, but an agent.³⁴ My reading of Kant differs in two respects: First, on my reading, the Categorical Imperative is a constitutive principle not of empirical willing, but of *pure* willing. If you are tempted to give false testimony, your reason will prescribe that it is morally wrong, and the imperative is constitutive of that prescription. One's pure will is not under one's control, and the moral law describes how this pure will necessarily functions. But, and this is the second difference, the command to universalize is not just necessary if one does not want to be a mere heap. One's maxim could be internally consistent, although one would not want others to act on these maxims as well. One could be a well-functioning scoundrel. The moral law is necessary not to be a well-organized agent, but to be a morally good agent.

Schönecker questions how such an account could avoid the is-ought gap (cf. p. 73): If the moral law is the descriptive law of freedom, how can one get something normative out of a merely descriptive law? Kant's point, as I read him, is that the moral law is a descriptive law for perfectly rational beings, i.e., being who do not have inclinations that tempt them to act against the moral law. It is only

**<sup>33</sup>** Cf. Korsgaard, Christine: *Sources of Normativity.* Cambridge 1996, 235.

**<sup>34</sup>** Cf. Korsgaard, Christine: *Self-Constitution*. Oxford 2009, 72–76.

to beings like us who have rationality as well as inclinations that the moral law appears as an Ought: "for this 'ought' is strictly speaking a 'will' that holds for every rational being under the condition that reason in him is practical without hindrance"³⁵ (GMS, AA 04: 449.16–18). The ought expresses what a being wholly governed by reason would naturally will. This – and here I disagree with Klemme (cf. pp. 90 f.) – is all that is needed to explain obligation. Obligation expresses "an *ought* or a *necessitation*" ["ein *Sollen* oder eine *Nöthigung*"] (V-MS/Vigil 27: 488.38). The necessitation is "the determination of the human will […] through moral rules" ["die Bestimmung des menschlichen Willens […] durch moralische Regeln"] (V-MS/Vigil 27: 485.36–39), and "the action […] is made necessary by the moral law"³⁶ (V-MS/Vigil 27: 489.13–15). In order to explain obligation, one therefore only needs the moral law, and a will that is subject to inclinations which tempt one to transgress the moral law, not an extra end or value.³⁷ Accordingly, when Kant refers to the relation of a will to itself (cf. GMS, AA 04: 427.13–18, Klemme p. 89) he does not talk about ends, but objectively necessary laws. Obligation is explained by the relation of a will to its own, autonomous law: "The dependence upon the principle of autonomy of a will that is not absolutely good (moral necessitation) is *obligation*. This, accordingly, cannot be attributed to a holy being."³⁸ (GMS, AA 04: 439.30–33) Klemme could object that one needs an objective end in order to explain how pure reason can be practical, and I shall address this in the next section.

## **4 Moral Motivation and Ends in Themselves**

So far I have argued that one can explain the requirement to respect others, as well as moral obligation in general, without grounding them on a prior value. But three commentators object that one would still need a value in order to comply with the Categorical Imperative, or be motivated to be moral. Schönecker asks

**<sup>35</sup>** "[…] denn dieses Sollen ist eigentich ein Wollen, das unter der Bedingung für jedes vernünftige Wesen gilt, wenn die Vernunft bei ihm ohne Hindernisse praktisch wäre […]."

**<sup>36</sup>** "[…] die Handlung […] durchs moralische Gesetz nothwendig gemacht […] wird."

**<sup>37</sup>** Klemme's reference to Wolff (note 10) does not seem to support the need for an end since Kant distances himself from Wolff's approach as not being the pure philosophy Kant advocates (cf. GMS, AA 04: 390.19–391.15). For Kant's account of obligation see my forthcoming (note 15).

**<sup>38</sup>** "Die Abhängigkeit eines nicht schlechterdings guten Willens vom Princip der Autonomie (die moralische Nöthigung) ist *Verbindlichkeit*. Diese kann also auf ein heiliges Wesen nicht gezogen werden."

why one should be moral, on my account, and says that there is no reason for it. Bojanowski too raises the issue of why one should be motivated on my account (cf. p. 80), and Klemme notes that Kant introduces his concept of an end in itself, or a will that wills itself, in order to explain how moral action (not just obligation) is possible.

Schönecker asks flat out why, on my account, one should respect other human beings (cf. p. 73). I grant that it is a common view to think that every act must serve a good or value, and it is a common interpretation of Kant that every action needs an end; that moral actions need a special moral end; and that this end is humanity as an end in itself.³⁹ (Cf. Korsgaard 1996, ch. 4.) However, I do not believe that this reading is correct (cf. KoHD, 57–60). When we teach the first section of the *Groundwork* or the third chapter of the *Critique of Practical Reason*, we emphasize that reason can of itself be practical. What is more, we do not mention an end that is needed to motivate. To the contrary, we emphasize that one should do the morally right action merely out of respect for the moral law: "What is essential to any moral worth of actions is *that the moral law determine the will immediately*"⁴⁰ (KpV, AA 05: 71.28–30): immediately, not mediated by an end. If the will determines itself "*anywhere else* than in the fitness of its maxim for its own giving of universal laws […] *heteronomy* always results"⁴¹ (GMS, 04: 441.03–07) Yet, when scholars turn to the passage leading up to the Formula of Humanity (GMS, AA 04: 427.19–429.12), all of a sudden they affirm that an end is needed for determining moral actions. It seems to me that one cannot have it both ways.

Heiner Klemme presents strong evidence for the view that an objective end is needed for the self-determination of pure reason (pp. 88–92). I agree with most of his steps, but not with all, and consequently not with the result. Klemme focuses on the passage that leads up to the Formula of Humanity (GMS, AA 04: 425.01–429.12). The question Kant sets at the beginning is whether the Categorical Imperative is a necessary law for all rational beings (cf. GMS, AA 04: 426.22–25). Kant asks "whether there really is such an imperative" ["daß dergleichen Imperativ wirklich stattfinde"] (GMS, AA 04: 425.08 f.). To discover this, Kant wants to take a step into metaphysics, but he is quick to point out that he does not mean metaphysics here in the sense of insights into a supersensible realm of the kind

**<sup>39</sup>** Cf. Korsgaard, Christine: *Creating the Kingdom of Ends*. Cambridge 1996, 109 f.

**<sup>40</sup>** "Das Wesentliche alles sittlichen Werths der Handlungen kommt darauf an, *daß das moralische Gesetz unmittelbar den Willen bestimme.*"

**<sup>41</sup>** "Wenn der Wille irgend *worin anders*, als in der Tauglichkeit seiner Maximen zu seiner eigenen allgemeinen Gesetzgebung […] das Gesetz sucht, […] so kommt jederzeit *Heteronomie* heraus."

Kant had tried to repudiate in the *Critique of Pure Reason*. Rather Kant refers to a metaphysics of morals (cf. GMS, AA 04: 426.30), which he specifies as a "system of a priori cognition" ["System der Erkenntniß *a priori*"] (MS, AA 06: 216.28).⁴² The idea is that the Categorical Imperative is a necessary law for all rational beings if it is already connected with the concept of a will as such, and if this connection can be unfolded a priori (cf. GMS, AA 04: 426.25–27).

In order to draw this connection, Kant explains the structure of the will. A will is the capacity to act on the representation of laws, and ends determine the will. Some ends are based on inclinations or *stimuli* which are relative, others are based on *motiva*, or representations of reason (cf. GMS, AA 04: 427.26–30). Some motives are connected to happiness, others to the moral value of our persons (cf. V-Mo/Mron II, AA 29: 611.30–612.14). However – and here I disagree with Klemme – humanity as an end in itself is not something that is this end given by reason. On Kant's account, the ends given by reason which are valid for all rational beings are one's own perfection and the happiness of others, and they are explicitly said to *follow* from the Categorical Imperative (cf. MS, AA 06: 382.08–27). These moral ends are needed to counter the ends set by inclinations (cf. MS, AA 06: 380.25–381.03). Humanity, on the other hand is an "*independently existing*" end ["*selbständiger Zweck*"] (GMS, AA 04: 437.27). It is not something that "we of ourselves actually make our end" but something that "as an objective end […] ought as a law to constitute the supreme limiting condition of all our subjective ends"⁴³ (GMS, AA 04: 431.05–08). In short: A human being *exists* as end in itself (cf. GMS, AA 04: 428.07 f.).

At this point, many people go on to read the *Groundwork* passage as a justification for the requirement to respect others. Human beings are ends in themselves, and an end in itself is the ground of the Categorical Imperative (cf. GMS, AA 04: 428.03–06). However, I have already argued that this cannot be the case. Kant argues that value cannot be the foundation of moral requirements (see Section 2 above), and he does not present an argument according to which I value myself, and therefore have to value everyone else. For any such argument to work, I have argued, one recurs to the Categorical Imperative or an existing value (cf. KoHD ch. 2). But if being an end in itself alone is not the justification for morality, what then is an end in itself, and how does it ground the Categorical Imperative?

**<sup>42</sup>** I therefore disagree with Schönecker (cf. p. 73) and Klemme (cf. p. 92) who seem to read metaphysics as a reference to Kant's distinction between a phenomenal and intelligible world.

**<sup>43</sup>** "[… Gegenstand, den] man sich von selbst wirklich zum Zwecke macht, sondern als objectiver Zweck, der […] als Gesetz die oberste einschränkende Bedingung aller subjectiven Zwecke ausmachen soll […]."

In the book I argued that 'end in itself' is not *primarily* or *in the first instance*  a normative notion.⁴⁴ Of course, it does also have a normative connotation. It is Kant's view that what is an end in itself should be treated as an end in itself, and this view has some intuitive appeal. However, by itself this is not an argument. Just switch 'end in itself' with other beings or things: a rat should be treated as a rat, or a stone as a stone. What does it mean? By itself, being a stone or a rat does not explain how or why one should treat it in one way rather than another. Apply this to end in itself. What is an end in itself, and why should one treat it as such? In one meaning, end in itself could be used as meaning to 'value something for its own sake,' such as one should value the Categorical Imperative for duty's sake. However, in connection with humanity, an end in itself is not a way of specifying of how one values something. Human beings exist as ends in themselves, independently of what one values (see above). Klemme (cf. p. 93) and Schönecker (cf. p. 72) seem to agree with me that it is freedom that makes something an end in itself. How does freedom ground the Categorical Imperative? It is not that freedom as such is valuable (cf. again the Robinson Crusoe example). Rather, in a footnote (GMS, AA 04: 429.35 f.) Kant refers to the third section of the *Groundwork*  for an explanation of this idea. There he argues that the moral law is the causal law of freedom. Freedom is a form of causality, causality involves a law, and the moral law is the law of freedom (cf. GMS, AA 04: 446.07–447.10). If rational wills have freedom, and freedom is the ground of the moral law, then the moral law is a necessary law for all rational beings. The *Groundwork* passage on humanity as an end in itself therefore appears in a very different light, depending on whether one reads it in isolation, or against the background of his theory of value, the foundation of morality, and the emphasis on a priori elements.

However, Schönecker might reply that 'end in itself' means 'absolute value' and that it is the value that justifies why one should respect others. To this end he cites Kant's lecture notes "Naturrecht Feyerabend", where Kant says: "Der Mensch nemlich ist Zweck an sich selbst, er kann *daher* nur einen *innern* Wert d: i: Würde haben, an dessen Stelle kein Aequivalent gesetzt werden kann" (V-NR/ Feyerabend, AA 27: 1319.33–35; his emphasis). Does not the "*daher*" indicate that an end in itself has an inner value and should be respected? However, it is not clear what kind of relation the "*daher*" refers to. If it is meant as an argumentative step from one thing (end in itself) to another (inner value) then the two are not synonymous, and it is a further question why the one leads to the other. Kant

**<sup>44</sup>** For instance, I do not believe that one can just equate 'has absolute value' and 'exists as end in itself' as Klemme seems to do (cf. p. 90). For one cannot make the substitution when Kant says that only a good will has absolute value (cf. GMS, AA 04: 393.05–07).

explicitly states why one's own will is restricted by the will of another: "Diese Einschränkung beruht auf den Bedingungen der möglichsten allgemeinen Einstimmung des Willens andrer" (V-NR/Feyerabend, AA 27: 1319.30–32). On Kant's view, it is not the mere existence of the other that generates any obligation, nor is it the claims he makes (cf. V-MS/Vigil 27: 545.15 f. and 521.01–09). The only way a claim another makes on me "can be binding is through its qualification as a universal law"⁴⁵ (MS, AA 06: 393.20–22, cf. 451.04–19). It is this requirement, demanded by the Categorical Imperative, that grounds moral obligation.

However, to come back to Schönecker's initial question, why ought one follow the Categorical Imperative and respect others? The answer lies in Schönecker's ontoethical principle: Reason subordinates the claims of one's inclinations to the claim of one's moral law, since the moral law arises out of one's intelligence and proper self, while the inclinations are only part of one's appearance. But reason subordinates appearances to things in themselves: "*what belongs to mere appearance is necessarily subordinated by reason to the constitution of the thing in itself*"⁴⁶ (GMS, AA 04: 461.04–06)⁴⁷

### **5 Kant's conception of dignity**

Since the commentators mostly disagree with my reading of Kant's conception of value and ends in themselves, it is not surprising that there are also disagreements with my understanding of dignity. Schönecker questions my reading of Cicero, Bojanowski disagrees with my reading of Kant's *Groundwork* passage on dignity, and Bacin offers very helpful modifications to my account of the traditional conception of dignity, which lead me to modify my views of dignity in two respects.

To recapitulate: In the book, my interpretation of dignity comes after I have argued that Kant does not ground moral requirements on a prior and independent value, as in the contemporary paradigm of dignity, but that Kant bases the requirement to respect others on the Categorical Imperative (chapters 1–3). This is important, because if I am right about this, one cannot just read the contemporary conception of dignity into the passages where Kant uses the term 'dignity.' But how, then, does Kant use the term? Kant credits the Stoics for his account

**<sup>45</sup>** "[…] durch ihre Qualification zu einem allgemeinem Gesetz […] verbinden kann."

**<sup>46</sup>** "[…] *was aber zur bloßen Erscheinung gehört, wird von der Vernunft nothwendig der Beschaffenheit der Sache an sich selbst untergeordnet*."

**<sup>47</sup>** For a fuller discussion see again my forthcoming (note 21, 233–258).

of dignity (cf. RGV, AA 06: 57.08–58.20). In chapter 4 of the book I analyze the differences between our contemporary understanding of dignity, and the traditional notion inspired by the Stoics. I focus on four essential differences. In the traditional conception (1) 'dignity' is not the name for a metaphysical value property, but expresses a relation, namely that something is raised above all else; (2) 'dignity' has two stages: Human beings are initially raised above the rest of nature in virtue of certain capacities they have (e.g., reason or freedom), but one only realizes one's initial dignity if one uses these capacities properly; (3) dignity is not connected with rights, but duties; and (4) the duty with which dignity is connected is in the first instance a duty to oneself.

Dieter Schönecker disagrees with my first point. In particular, he believes that Cicero, the first source of the traditional Stoic conception of dignity (cf. KoHD, 155–157), conceives of dignity as a value, and that this value is used to derive duties (cf. p. 73 f.). Schönecker bases his interpretation on the claim that 'raised above' is a value judgment, and that the fact that something is raised gives rise to moral requirements. This is a crucial point. As far as I can see, the fact that something is raised above something else is not by itself a *moral* value that generates any rights or duties. It depends on the scale of comparison that is used. Something can be raised in terms of beauty, truth, or purity, for instance. The Stoic conception is based on an older, archaic conception of dignity which referred to the elevated position of one or a few in a group. This elevation might refer to the elevated standing of a senator, king, or priest, but in this sense Kant also talks about the dignity of mathematics (KrV, B 323), or of a teacher (cf. RGV, AA 06: 162.19). The phrase 'raised above' is elliptical. One still needs to specify in which respect something is higher than something else. This can be in terms of moral qualities but does not have to be. A senator is raised in terms of the political power he has, but he might be morally corrupt. Mathematics is raised above other disciplines in virtue of being more purely a priori. But by itself this is not a moral elevation. Otherwise we all would have a moral duty to become or look up to mathematicians, teachers, and senators.⁴⁸ Accordingly, I conclude in the book that Kant uses 'dignity' to express that something is 'raised above' everything else. But what is raised above and in which respect needs to be specified in every context. It can refer to the elevation of mathematics, the special abilities human beings have over the rest of nature in virtue of possessing freedom, or to the supe-

**<sup>48</sup>** I also disagree with Schönecker on the interpretation of Cicero. It is not that being raised generates an obligation towards other human beings, but there is an additional premise, to live according to nature (see KoHD, 156 f.).

rior standing of morality in terms of value.⁴⁹ But by itself, 'dignity' just expresses the relation that something is raised above something else.⁵⁰

Nonetheless, I now believe that I should modify my initial characterization of the four features of the traditional paradigm of dignity. Stefano Bacin's comments convinced me that my account of the differences between the contemporary and traditional paradigms needs to be refined. Bacin points to Pufendorf's usage of 'dignity' in order to argue for three points: (i) that even in the traditional paradigm the reference to dignity is sometimes used as an intuitively appealing argument that – even if it is elliptical and not valid by itself – is often used as a shorthand to convince people; (ii) that in this shorthand argument dignity is sometimes connected with rights, and (iii) that in this argument dignity is connected with the rights of others. In particular, Bacin points to the following passage in Pufendorf to make his case: "Surely I am not a dog or a beast but as much a man as you" (p. 3). Here it seems that the mere fact of being human and raised above animals is the reason why one can claim rights from others. If this were Pufendorf's ultimate justification, then he would use 'dignity' in a way that does not fit the pattern I have described in the book.

However, I think that the story is more complicated than that. The traditional paradigm of dignity, I have noted, is tied to a different, archaic pattern of thought. In this old notion, 'dignity' is reserved for only a few such as a king or senator. It is a complicated concept that has many facets. 'Dignity' refers to a rank, but it has further connotations, such as (i) the suitability and worthiness to occupy that rank, (ii) a visual impressiveness and excellence, (iii) the esteem one receives for occupying this rank (cf. KohD, 153–155). The high rank came with a duty to walk, speak, and behave in a certain way. But the rank or the excellence of its occupant might also exact esteem from the people below, and it would entitle the occupant to claim certain privileges akin to a right. It seems that Pufendorf mixes elements from the traditional and archaic conceptions of dignity. At first glance, one might think that esteem, or claiming a right because of one's rank, does not make sense in the traditional paradigm. In the archaic conception, the respect comes from the people below. The traditional paradigm, by contrast, talks about

**<sup>49</sup>** I therefore disagree with Schönecker's summary of the main claim of my book (cf. p. 69). I am not claiming that human beings have dignity only because they should be respected. There are many ways in which a human being might be elevated: as a teacher, free being, through a good will etc. Schönecker's initial critique of what he takes to be my main thesis uses 'dignity' and 'value' as synonyms, but this is exactly what I believe one cannot do.

**<sup>50</sup>** Schönecker does not seem right when he states that 'raised above all else' is not relational (cf. p. 74). The expression is relational since it refers to something else. Schönecker might mean that it is not relative, since what has dignity is absolutely raised, i.e., above all else.

the elevation of human beings over animals and plants. But if one meets a hungry lion in the desert, one is unlikely to be esteemed by the animal for one's capacity of freedom. Pufendorf argues that one human being can expect esteem from his equals for being raised above animals (cf. p. 100).

However, this is not Pufendorf's ultimate *argument* for why one should respect others – as Bacin agrees (cf. pp. 102–104). The further justification Bacin cites runs: "since one cannot lead a social life with someone by whom one is not esteemed at least as a man, it follows as a precept of the natural law that 'Everyone must esteem and treat other mean as his natural equals, or as men in the same sense as he" (p. 100). This justification rests on the premise that one should be social: "the fundamental natural law is: every man ought … to cultivate and preserve sociality"⁵¹ Why should one be social? For Pufendorf, this obligation ultimately rests on God (cf. his 1682, Bk 1, Ch. 2, Sect. 6). So the reference to "I am not a dog" is not the main argument, in my view, but merely an intuitively plausible shorthand for an obligation one owes to God. I think Bacin is right (cf. pp. 104–107) that Kant too uses such shorthands in the *Metaphysics of Morals* when he says, for instance, that certain vices would debase or lower oneself to the level of animals (cf. MS, AA 06: 427.21 f.).

What the example of Pufendorf brings out is that my classification of the differences of the contemporary and traditional paradigm of dignity has to be modified in two respects. Dignity is still (1) an elevation, (2) that has two stages, (3) and dignity is connected with duties, but (4) it is not always connected to a duty to oneself. What the traditional views of dignity have in common, it seems to me, is that duties are not grounded in a value of the other. However, different authors use different normative premises. One should live according to nature (Cicero), imitate God (Leo the Great), live up to one's standing in the chain of being (Pico della Mirandola), or follow God's command (Pufendorf). In the book I mentioned different premises (cf. KoHD, 155–161), but I went on to say that they all refer to a duty towards self. However, a duty towards God is not a duty towards self. This aspect – and here too I agree with Bacin – is Kant's special way of grounding moral requirements. On Kant's account, even the demand to respect others derives from one's own moral law within (cf. MS, AA 06: 417.24–418.03). This special Kantian way of grounding obligation is the autonomy of reason, or the view that moral requirements originate in one's own reason.⁵²

**<sup>51</sup>** Pufendorf (1682): *On the Duty of Man and Citizen According to Natural Law*. Ed. by J. Tully, trad. by M. Silverthorne. Cambridge 1991, Book I, Chapter 3, Section 9.

**<sup>52</sup>** Cf. my: "The moral importance of autonomy". In: *Kant on Moral Autonomy*. Ed. by Oliver Sensen. Cambridge 2012, 262 f.

The second modification I should make to my characterization of the traditional conception of dignity is that the elevation might still be connected to esteem, and often takes the form of a shorthand argument – exactly as Bacin points out. The traditional paradigm can therefore be characterized as follows (and the list still might not be complete): Dignity expresses (1) an elevation, which (2) has two stages, and (3) depends on some normative premise to derive duties, (4) a premise which is not grounded in a value of others; however (5) the elevation of oneself or others is sometimes used as an intuitive (but incomplete) argument to demand respect.

Bojanowski does not question that Kant uses the traditional paradigm of dignity, but he argues that he also uses the contemporary one (cf. pp. 83–86). In Chapter 5 of the book I analyzed the passages in the *Groundwork* and *Metaphysics of Morals* that seem to put forth the contemporary paradigm (cf. GMS, AA 04: 434.20–436.07; MS, AA 06: 434.22–436.13, 462.10–32). I argue that even those passages follow the traditional paradigm. Bojanowski disagrees with my analysis. He argues that a close reading of the phrase: "relative worth, i.e., price, but an inner worth, i.e., dignity" ["relativen Werth, d. i. einen Preis, sondern einen inner Werth, d. i. Würde"] (GMS, AA 04: 435.03 f.) shows that Kant uses 'dignity' as a definition of absolute worth, and that Kant wants to give the argument that – to paraphrase the crucial step – because morality has an inner value, humanity insofar as it is capable of morality also has an absolute value (cf. p. 85).

I grant that Bojanowski's version is the most natural reading of the *Groundwork* passage. If one reads the phrase about price and dignity in connection with the view that morality and humanity have dignity, then it seems as if Kant wants to say that humanity has an absolute value, and 'dignity' is the name for it. However, the argument from the value of morality to a value of humanity would not be sound: two different objects could not have the highest value (cf. KoHD 92), and this reading conflicts with Kant's main tenets that only a good will has unconditional value (cf. GMS, AA 04: 393.05–07), that not all human beings have a good will (cf. MS, AA 06: 463.08) but that all human beings should be respected (cf. MS, AA 06: 463.12–21). A close reading of the passage has to start earlier than the phrase about price and dignity, and include the question Kant aims to address. His question is why a morally good being follows the Categorical Imperative. Kant's answer is that one does not do so in order to gain an advantage but because of the dignity of morality (cf. KoHD 182–184). Morality has an inner value. In virtue of being raised above things that merely have a relative worth, morality might exact esteem as in the archaic paradigm of dignity. Before morality "*my spirit bows*, whether I want it or whether I do not"⁵³ (KpV, AA 05:

**<sup>53</sup>** "[…] *bückt sich mein Geist*, ich mag wollen oder nicht […]."

77.04). The inner worth of morality is a dignity or splendor, but not every dignity is tied to morality or an inner worth: One might esteem mathematics or a teacher. The *Groundwork* passage on dignity and price therefore does not introduce a new justification for why one should respect others; the passage is about why one should follow the moral law, and it even confirms the justification I have argued for above (cf. Sections 2 and 3), for Kant states: "For, nothing can have a worth other than that which the law determines for it."⁵⁴ (GMS, AA 04: 436.01 f.)

## **Conclusion**

If one reads Kant's passages on dignity and price, as well as on humanity as an end in itself in isolation, it appears as if Kant uses the contemporary paradigm of dignity. However, if one connects them to the main tenets of Kant's philosophy, and clarifies the terms Kant uses, I think that a very different picture emerges. Nonetheless, the challenges raised by my critics are the most important ones, and they have helped me to sharpen and reconsider my argument in important ways. The debate will go on.
