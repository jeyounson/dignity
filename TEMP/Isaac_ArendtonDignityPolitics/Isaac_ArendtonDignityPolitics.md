# A New Guarantee on Earth: Hannah Arendt on Human Dignity and the Politics of Human Rights

JEFFREY C. ISAAC Indiana University, Bloomington

T hile the writings of Hannah Arendt have received an extraordinary amount of scholarly attention, few commentators have seen her as a theorist concerned with questions of human rights. I argue that the problem of human rights was central to Arendt's political theory. While she does not elaborate a theory of human rights as such, and while she avoids the juridical approaches so common among human rights theorists and advocates, her conception of political action is intended to secure an elemental human dignity that is systematically jeopardized by the imperatives of national sovereignty.

Human dignity needs a new guarantee which can be found only in a new political principle, in a new law on earth, whose validity this time must comprehend the whole of humanity while its power must remain strictly limited, rooted in and controlled by newly defined territorial entities (Arendt 1973, ix).

annah Arendt is perhaps the most widely studied political philosopher of the twentieth century. Yet, little attention is paid to her views on human rights. While this is strange, it is not inexplicable, for in her constructive works she studiously avoided the vocabulary of rights, preferring instead to speak of "freedom" or "praxis." In the terms made famous by Isaiah Berlin, Arendt was a theorist of "positive" rather than "negative" liberty, one for whom problems of political participation and civic agency occupied center stage, and for whom the juridical strategies for limiting state power typically favored by liberals were not central (Berlin 1969; Shapiro 1986). She also drew inspiration from classical models of the ancient polis that had scant concern for human rights, models that advanced a conception of republican citizenship and patriotism which left little room for any conception of the human as such. These models exercised a powerful hold on Arendt's political imagination, particularly in those philosophical works most commonly interpreted by academic political theorists, such as The Human Condition, Between Past and Future, and, to a lesser extent, On Revolution.

Yet, the problem of human rights-understanding their intellectual foundations, securing their respectwas central to everything Arendt wrote. It was the subtext of The Origins of Totalitarianism and the pretext of Eichmann in Jerusalem, probably the two books most widely known outside the circle of professional political philosophers. It motivated her critique of nuclear politics in her essays on the Cold War, her dissent from maximalist Zionism, and her opposition to the Vietnam War. In each of these instances she criticized forms of official propaganda and hubris that obscured palpable threats to the rights of civilians, refugees, national minorities, and disobedients, those groups most powerless before the imperatives of national sovereignty.1 On a more practical level, a concern with human rights was the source of some of Arendt's most notable political involvements: as a worker for Youth Aliyah in the 1930s, in which capacity she personally transported Jewish refugee children to Palestine; as a supporter of Spanish refugee aid in the 1940s; and as an active member of PEN and Amnesty International (Young-Bruehl 1982).

While Arendt presented her political theory as an effort to restore an almost completely eclipsed public world, this effort was motivated in large part by the distinctively modern problems of displacement and degradation, what she called "worldlessness." In countering this worldlessness, she addressed a number of issues central to the problem of human rights: the incompatibility of national sovereignty with human dignity and civic responsibility; the need to rethink the ethical foundations of human rights at a time when liberal pieties about natural rights had lost all credibility; and the need for new forms of politics-international jurisprudence, regional and global forms of confederalism, unofficial forms of civic initiative-to afford political empowerment to ordinary citizens and ground a commitment to human dignity.

Arendt's lack of explicit attention to distinctively moral arguments of the kind to be found in more recent, standard classics of political philosophy, such as John Rawls's A Theory of Justice, has led many to overlook her concern with human rights; and this gap in her writing might well constitute a limitation of her thinking. While she does write favorably of Kant, perhaps she should have done more to engage directly the concerns of moral philosophers in the Kantian tradition of analytic reasoning. But her refusal to do so had its reasons. She believed that human rights were not a problem of moral speculation or legal philosophy so much as a problem of politics, a matter of mobilizing new and effective forms of solidarity and concern. Her political theory hardly offers an exhaustive account of the moral and legal issues involved in human rights, but it contains an indispensable insight, one not found in those more prominent works of moral philosophy that focus more centrally on the elaboration of human rights. Namely, the problem of rightlessness that has plagued our world since 1914 can only be remedied by a reconstitution of political identities and the formation of new forms of community which

challenge the hegemony of the nation-state. In her distinctively political approach to the problem. Arendt makes a contribution, often overlooked, that remains unsurpassed.

#### TOTALITARIANISM AND MODERN WORLDLESSNESS

"Human dignity needs a new guarantee." It is no accident that Arendt should introduce her analysis of totalitarianism with this thought. For the problem of human rights-the extent to which human rights is a profound problem, requiring new understandings and new practices-is the central concern of The Origins. She offers a well-known morphology of the "elements" of totalitarianism, but this account is lodged in a much broader analysis of the circumstances that made totalitarian genocide possible. While Arendt emphatically rejects the idea that totalitarianism is the necessary outgrowth of modern humanism,2 she views it as the terrifying apotheosis of certain tendencies of modern politics that render large numbers of people powerless and vulnerable to dangerous and often violent social and political forces.

This is the main theme of Part Two of The Origins, "Imperialism." Arendt's analysis of imperialism draws from Rosa Luxemburg, J.A. Hobson, and other turn-ofthe-century theorists who argued that imperialism is a form of expansionist politics driven by domestic surpluses of capital. But Arendt extends this analysis in important ways. First, she focuses, in hindsight, less on the causes than on the consequences of imperialism, a series of geopolitical conflicts which set in motion the two world wars that produced totalitarianism in Germany and the Soviet Union (Arendt 1973, 267). Second, she treats imperialism as part of a dramatic transformation of European politics, creating kinds of human suffering experienced in only extreme form by the victims of totalitarianism. As she notes: "Perhaps it may even be that the true predicaments of our time will assume their authentic form-though not necessarily the cruelest-only when totalitarianism has become a thing of the past" (1973, 460).

The "true predicament" of our time ushered in by the age of imperialism is the "superfluity" of large numbers of ordinary people, "the masses." The masses, a recent historical formation, are superfluous in the sense that their active participation becomes increasingly dispensable in economic and political life. This dispensability is produced in part by the processes of capital accumulation, which result in continual expropriations, occupational and demographic shifts, and unemployment.3 It is also created by the concentration of political power within bureaucratic structures and the ascendancy of "state employed administrators of violence," who become increasingly remote from ordinary citizens and from representative institutions, and who increasingly are indispensable to the operation of an imperial foreign policy (1973, 137). The result of such processes is the disempowerment and deracination of increasingly larger numbers of people. In such circumstances the ties of citizenship and class begin to lose their force, and nationalism becomes "a precious cement for binding together a centralized state and an atomized society" (1973, 231).

But this cement was to prove itself increasingly noxious, indeed fatal, to both peace and human security. While nationalism had been an important ingredient in the republican revolutions of the mid-nineteenth century, by the turn of this century it began to assume antirepublican, often protofascist, forms. The first taste of this was the Dreyfus affair, in which French nationalism was mobilized against the Jewish Alfred Dreyfus, cast as un-French, anti-French, Other. Against this anti-Semitic surge stood Clemenceau, one of the only "heroes" identified in The Origins, who articulated "the stern Jacobin concept of the nation based on human rights-that republican view of communal life which asserts that (in the words of Clemenceau) by infringing on the rights of one you infringe on the rights of all" (1973, 106). Clemenceau's appeal to universal principles wore thin at the end of the century; by the onset of the next its utter bankruptcy would clearly be demonstrated.

In countries such as France, an early nationalizer with a strong republican tradition, the ideology of nationalism was put toward increasingly antirepublican purposes, supporting centralized power, geopolitical intrigue, and a conception of "patriotism" with often authoritarian implications. In countries such as Germany, a later nationalizer with a weak republican tradition, this antirepublicanism was even more pronounced. And in Central Europe, yet more tribalistic, exclusivist forms of national identity appeared "as the nationalism of those people who had not participated in national emancipation and had not achieved the sovereignty of a nation-state" (1973, 227). The fact that these nationalisms defied existing state boundaries made them irredentist as well. As a consequence Europe became a tinder box of increasingly exclusivist, and increasingly competitive, nationalist claims. On August 4, 1914, the tinder box exploded, setting off "a chain reaction in which we have been caught ever since and which nobody seems to be able to stop" (1973, 267).

According to Arendt the First World War "shattered the facade of Europe's political system to lay bare its hidden frame-the sufferings of vast numbers of people "to whom the rules of the world around them had suddenly ceased to apply" (1973, 267). In one of most powerful chapters of The Origins, "The Decline of the Nation-State and the End of the Rights of Man," Arendt argues that the war underscored the contradiction between the nation-state and the principle of human rights. In the name of the national interest the leaders of Europe had wreaked havoc upon their continent. The war produced millions of casualties and dislocated millions more. Effacing the distinction between combatant and civilian, it demonstrated that in the face of modern

warfare, and the nationalistic imperatives that propel it, ordinary people had no safe haven.

While the postwar settlements-the Versailles Treaty, the League of Nations, the Minority Treaties-sought to heal some of the wounds of war, Arendt argues that these were hopeless efforts to solve the problem without addressing its fundamental cause, the principle of national sovereignty itself: "No paradox of contemporary politics is filled with more poignant irony than the discrepancy between the efforts of well-meaning idealists who stubbornly insist on regarding as 'inalienable' those human rights which are enjoyed only by the citizens of the most prosperous and civilized countries, and the situation of the rightless themselves" (1973, 279). Despite their good intentions humanitarian reformers were doomed to failure as long as they refused to see that the principle of national sovereignty, by imperiously asserting the identity of nationality, citizenship, and state and denying any other principle of global or human responsibility and authority, was at bottom what made the sufferings of so many possible.4

Arendt writes with great passion, no doubt informed by her own experience as a refugee, 5 about the mass denationalizations of Central Europeans following the war, which produced a veritable epidemic of displaced and stateless peoples. She notes that national laws of asylum and naturalization exclude these peoples, that international law is unable to secure even the most basic rights for them, and indeed its principal enforcement organ-Interpol-operates by controlling, regulating, and policing "aliens" in the name of legality. The only substitute for a home that is offered by the regime of nation-states is, Arendt allows, the internment camp, a site of prolonged homelessness, an institutionalized limbo (1973, 284-86).6 In this regard the First World War not simply precipitated but prefigured the Second World War; and the crimes against humanity committed by the totalitarian regimes were the most brutal, extreme examples of an indifference, and often hostility, to human rights that is inscribed in the very logic of national sovereignty.

According to Arendt these events demonstrate conclusively the emptiness and ineffectuality of the discourse of natural rights that heralded the modern republican nation-state. The plight of the refugees, and even more the sufferings of the victims of totalitarian genocide, make clear that "the Rights of Man, supposedly inalienable, proved to be unenforceable ... whenever people appeared who were no longer citizens of any sovereign state." Deprived of citizenship, the stateless were deprived of more than their home, property, and political status; they were subjected to "the most fundamental deprivation," the loss of "a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective" (1973, 293, 296). They were deprived, in short, of their

basic human dignity, of their ability to function as moral and political agents, enjoying security and freedom among their fellows, experiencing the mutual recognition that only citizenship confers. According to Arendt such deprivations, and the miseries and barbarities they engendered, offer ironic, bitter confirmation of Edmund Burke's critique of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The survivors of the death camps attest that "the abstract nakedness of being nothing but human was their greatest danger" (1973, 330). Shorn of law and convention, treated as a purely "natural" creature-a beast-man was left naked and shivering, a vulnerable, miserable creature, prey to hostile forces.

Arendt insists that human dignity needs a new guarantee because its old guarantee, the nineteenth-century, Kantian idea of a cosmopolis of peaceful republics respecting the natural rights of man, had been destroyed.7 The faith in human moral agency had been shattered by the complicity of so many in the evils of the century and by the indifference of so many more to these evils. The confidence in the republican nation-state as the repository of the rights of man had been undermined by the experience, for three decades, of the most civilized nations on earth destroying cultures and peoples in the name of their sovereignty and then ignoring the plight of the suffering in the name of a concern with "their own."8 The political world had now become the world, the earth itself rather than that small part of it known as Europe, and in many ways the relevant community had now become all humanity. In such circumstances the Kantian ideal had revealed itself as narrow and parochial despite itself, its universalist convictions undermined by its commitment to the principle of national sovereignty, a principle that supported not peaceful cosmopolitanism and moral respect but imperial expansion, geopolitical intrigue, enormous violence, and, perhaps most troubling of all, a pervasive indifference to human suffering outside the confines of the nation.9

Arendt reflected on the Nazi policy of genocide in a 1944 essay, "Organized Guilt and Universal Responsibility," and wrote of "the terror of the idea of humanity." While the architects of modernity had associated a growing awareness of humanity with progress, civility, and peace, from the perspective of the mid-twentieth century such optimism was no longer possible. For the two world wars had ferociously demonstrated a truth that the reigning political ideologies had long denied, namely, "how great a burden mankind is for man" (1978, 234-35). The scientific power of humanity had issued in technologies of mass destruction and global annihilation. The economic power of humanity had produced a

<sup>6</sup> Reflecting sardonically on her own experience in a French internment camp, Arendt wrote: "Apparently nobody wants to know that contemporary history has created a new kind of human beings-the kind that are put into concentration camps by their foes and internment camps by their friends" (1978, 56).

Rome, Paris, Assisi . . . who knows before they will join Warsaw, Bath, Coventry, Nuremburg, Frankfort, Kiev, Cologne, Palermo, Naples, Rotterdam, Cracow, London, and Berlin? It is like living in a house with a maniac who may rip up the pictures, burn the books, slash up the rugs and furniture at any moment" (Sumner 1996). 9 On this indifference, see Bauman (1989).

truly global economy, incorporating the entire species into an intricate, productive, and volatile web of interrelationships, governed by forces blind to problems of human security and dignity. The political power of humanity had produced a world of competitive nationstates concentrating human allegiances and mobilizing enormous human energies into causes that were all too often exclusivist and hostile. In the face of these terrific, terrifying feats of human initiative, what seemed most obvious, and most disturbing, was less the power than the frailty of humankind, the vulnerability of humans, who have created an enormously complex, interdependent world and now must learn to assume responsibility for living together in this world.

#### HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE HUMAN CONDITION

For Arendt, human rights are not natural. Pace Locke and Paine; they are not inscribed in the nature of human existence, discernible principles of reason that normal creatures cannot help but respect. Pace Smith and Hutcheson, they are not secured by a "moral sense" implanted in the human heart. Pace Kant, they are not necessitated by the conscious reasoning of all humans as free subjects. For Arendt, human rights are conventions, forms of recognition produced by human agreement, fragile artifacts of human living together. As conventions they require more than the ineffectual if well-intentioned lip service often paid to them by well-meaning liberals. But Arendt is not willing to go all the way with Burke. She acknowledges the "pragmatic soundness" of Burke's insistence that human existence as such confers no moral entitlements, that all such entitlements rely upon authoritative forms of recognition which can only be found in definite communities. She cannot agree. however, that one's moral status is determined exclusively by one's local habitus, wholly "the offspring of convention," for if this were the case there would be little ground on which to condemn the suffering and disempowerment of those stateless, homeless, marginal persons who fall between the cracks of national or other authoritative political identities and outside officially recognized categories of membership.10 And there would be just as little basis for the defense of the principle of human dignity, an emphatically universalist principle, one that Arendt insists must-the imperative is ethical-find a new guarantee.11

Arendt does not explicitly develop a theory of human rights as such, but her political theory centers around the problems engendered by the failure of the rights of man to secure human dignity. She seeks, in other words, to reframe human rights. As Julia Kristeva puts it, she sees that we must maintain "the requirement of a human, trans-historical dignity, whose content nevertheless needs to be made more complex, beyond the eighteenth century's optimistic naivety" (1991, 153). By a transhistorical dignity, Kristeva means a dignity that applies

to humans as such, one that is universally valid and not appropriate only for certain individuals or societies. Yet, such a dignity cannot rely upon naive claims about human nature of the sort contained in the natural rights arguments that the twentieth century has falsified and that Arendt, following Burke, has criticized. How does Arendt develop an account more nuanced and complex? The answer is contained in a place where few have found it, The Human Condition.

This book is about the boundary conditions of being human, conditions that frame human existence without absolutely determining it. It presents, in other words, a theory of human existence. Arendt seeks to retrieve the distinctively human capacity for creative, transfigurative action and to reclaim the practices of citizenship to which this capacity is related. This emphasis on citizenship is perfectly consistent with the Burkean argument of The Origins. In both cases what distinguishes humans is the capacity for membership and participation that is grounded in their autonomy and intersubjectivity. In both cases, when humans are stripped of such membership and participation, they are naked and shivering creatures, undignified, unfree, vulnerable, less than fully human.

While the upshot of The Origins is that some other foundation for human dignity is necessary, many interpreters have read The Human Condition as a book about the baseness of the merely human in comparison with the grandeur of the superhuman, virtuous, courageous citizen. George Kateb presents the most extreme version of this view, proposing that there is "a dark underside" to Arendt's conception of praxis, "a barely indicated sense that wherever the threat of death is missing, political action is not truly present." Without the risk of death, Kateb suggests, citizenship would lack the honor and greatness essential for Arendt (Kateb 1987, 612-13).12 Credence is given to this interpretation by Arendt's notorious assertion that "the politically most pernicious doctrine of the modern age" is that "life is the highest good," a point elaborated at length in Arendt's famous chapter on labor in The Human Condition.13 It might seem, then, that in her political philosophy Arendt articulated a profound animus toward the very idea of basic human rights or an elemental human dignity, preferring instead a kind of heroism appropriate only to an elite unconcerned with the mundane problems of human living and human suffering. While there are grounds for this interpretation, I would like to suggest an alternative reading. While Arendt does not present her constructive political theory as a theory of human rights as such, her account of praxis is intended to highlight atrophied potentials whose realization might alone secure human dignity for all.14 Indeed, Arendt's account of these conditions can be read as an answer to the problem of human rights set out in The Origins.

<sup>10</sup> See Burke (1970, 150).

<sup>11</sup> A similar point, drawn explicitly from Arendt, is made by Kristeva (1991, 151-54).

<sup>12</sup> For a similar view, see Jay (1978). For both Kateb and Jay, Arendtian action is disconnected from moral principles and thus inhospitable to the rights that are the achievement of liberal democracy. Jay explicitly links Arendt to the discourse of "political existentialism" also developed by Carl Schmitt and other protofascist writers. 13 Kateb (1987, 613) cites this assertion from On Revolution.

<sup>14</sup> On this see Isaac (1992, 110-18).

For Arendt, the human condition is an inherently limited condition, since life is bounded by birth and death. She builds her argument on the twin concepts of natality and mortality. Natality corresponds to the experience of birth or beginning, which she connects with the possibility of human initiative or freedom. This capacity to begin is closely linked to the human capacity for speech, which allows us both to represent and to transfigure our common world, a point first made, of course, by Aristotle.15 Mortality is the ultimate limit of human existence-finitude and eventual death. Mortality poses problems of subsistence and survival, to which work and preeminently labor are attempts at solution. But for Arendt there are no ultimate solutions to this problem. All human efforts to deal with the fact of mortality are provisional and, as far as human reason can comprehend, futile. In this sense "man is compelled to assent to a Being which he has never created and to which he is essentially alien" (1946, 37).

Influenced by the "existenz philosophy" of her teacher Karl Jaspers, Arendt goes only half way with Burke. She agrees that humans are fragile creatures. Beneath the drapery of human conventions she sees vulnerability and mortality, but she also sees creativity and power. For Burke the "super-added ideas" and practices of human communities are almost Providentially sustained havens for a heartless world.16 Humans, naked and shivering, if they are fortunate find themselves clothed in such "decent drapery" and are thus redeemed; as the beneficiaries of this legacy they can take comfort from a wardrobe they took no part in furnishing. But Arendt takes a more Enlightened view; for her, human communities are themselves the products of human agreement, actualizations of the human capacity to infuse the world with meaning and imperfectly to shape it in accordance with this meaning, a process accomplished in concert with those others with whom one shares the world. Labor, work, and action all involve this effort to humanize the world, to make it our own. Each is productive but also limited. Labor secures subsistence, but it suffers from a Sisyphean futility. Work produces relatively imperishable creations, but these are only relatively imperishable. They are fragile artifacts, produced through a violence upon nature with often malignant consequences (a point also developed by the Frankfurt school). And action involves us in a seamless and boundless web of interrelationships; our deeds, enormously productive, often escape us, in surprising and often grotesque ways that we neither intend nor even imagine.

The Human Condition, then, presents us with the generic features of being human-human power and human limit. In the light of the terrible human catastrophe recounted in The Origins, it is clear why action is so

central for Arendt. Action is the distinctive human capacity to reflect upon, communicate about, and actively shape our common human condition of vulnerability and power in ways that promote dignity and freedom. It is only in concert, on the basis of claims that are mutually recognized and agreed to, that human dignity can be secured and continually resecured in a recalcitrant world.17 If we fail to act we will simply be acted upon. Given the forces at work in the modern world, such a course is unlikely to afford either security or freedom.

Action, then, represents a kind of civic initiative whereby humans resist degradation and assert their dignity. When we act we define ourselves for ourselves, and in so doing we inscribe the world as our world.18 This sheds a different light on why Arendt laments the "politically pernicious doctrine" that life is the highest good. It is not because she devalues life but precisely because she values living freely-both terms are important here-that she places so much emphasis on the capacity to begin anew, the basis of courageous civic initiative. A careful reading of the chapter on labor in The Human Condition reveals that the "philosophy of life" Arendt deplores is not really a strong conviction about the dignity of the human personality or the sanctity of human life; it is the ethos of consumption that she associates with modern mass society, the idea that the essence of life is the appropriation of material objects, and that human productivity is the preeminent criterion of human well-being. It is this idea she resists. Yet, she is careful not to dismiss categorically the emphasis on basic material thriving that is the product of the Enlightenment. She describes it as politically rather than humanly pernicious. Why? Perhaps because she does not wish to deny completely the value of such an ethos but only to caution against its hegemony. The emphasis on basic human needs that has informed so much of modern moral philosophy has helped to advance the idea of an elemental, universal humanity, an idea Arendt does not reject but cannot embrace. For the irony is that the modern age, which proclaims the value of life above all else, is also the age of genocidal mass murder. This was surely not an irony lost on Arendt. I would suggest, then, that when she places action over life, she is not endorsing a mystique of heroic sacrifice or the existential confrontation with death but, rather, a conception of civic initiative that alone can affirm basic human rights and dignities. She wants to resist the enormous brutality and suffering characteristic of the twentieth century. She does so, however, not by appealing to a doctrine of natural rights before which men are passive recipients but by emphasizing the activity of human beings, who can only achieve their dignity by doing something about it. In a world filled with cruelty, mendacity, and callous indifference, such activity will surely often involve danger, and the person who acts will be a person of courage, willing to endure sacrifice and

<sup>15</sup> This Arendtian point is developed beautifully in Havel (1992).

<sup>16</sup> See Burke's lament that "all the pleasing illusions ... are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the superadded ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination . . . as necessary to cover the defects of our naked shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation, are to be exploded as a ridiculous, absurd, antiquated fashion" (1970, 171).

<sup>17</sup> This explains the importance of promising, consent, and dissent in Arendt's work (see 1958, 243-47; and "Civil Disobedience" in 1972, 83-102).

<sup>18</sup> A similar point is developed by Booth (1993).

perhaps risk death in the name of a higher value. But the risk is endured in the name of a higher value-human dignity-and not out of an existential attraction to limit-situations.

What Arendt has in mind can perhaps be clarified by considering the actions of Vaclav Havel, who in his 1975 open "Letter to Dr. Gustav Husak" denounced the Czech communist regime for promoting "the principle of outward adaptation," whereby the citizen is offered all the benefits befitting "an obedient member of a consumer herd" in exchange for his political quiescence. "All the evidence suggests that the authorities are applying a method quite adequate for dealing with a creature whose only aim is self-preservation. Seeking the path of least resistance, they completely ignore the price that must be paid-the harsh assault on human integrity, the brutal castration of the humanity of men" (1986, 12). It could be said that Havel underestimates the moral significance of a regime which can offer relative security and prosperity to its people, and that his criticism implicates some classical or Nietzschean conception of heroic virtue. But, of course, Havel was at this time a persecuted dissident on behalf of human rights, and the regime he opposed, while it offered comfort in exchange for quiescence, offered no security for such rights, either to him or to the more ordinary Czechs whose comfort was utterly contingent on the unpredictable policies of an authoritarian regime. It alone ruled as Guardian, and the citizens were expected to submit like sheep. He denounces "a creature whose only aim is self-preservation" not out of a dismissiveness about security and civil liberty but in their very name. His point is that Czechs, in order to secure their basic liberties and rights, need to develop and sustain a commitment to these rights and to take initiative on their behalf.19

As I read Arendt's criticism of "life," she is making much the same point. I would suggest that when she writes of "life" she is thinking about all of those who sat idly by during the interwar years, living in security and comfort and indifferent to the impending political crisis and to the suffering and degradation it could cause. And when she writes of "praxis" she is thinking of those Danish resisters during World War II who at great risk to themselves refused to comply with Nazi efforts to deport the Jews.20 Arendt does not disparage the desire to lead a normal life, but she does believe that in the dark times of the twentieth century one must have courage and be willing to take risks-one must act-in order to secure such a life. "Praxis," then, is preeminently a way of being that is essential to basic human dignity in late modernity.21

The theme of dignity is highlighted in Arendt's 1946 essay on existentialism, in which she invokes Kant's idea that "in every single individual humanity can be debased or exalted." In this spirit she recommends the philosophy of Jaspers, which "sounds the appeal to my freedom [which arises] through communication with others, who as my fellows and through the appeal to our common reason guarantee the universal." Jaspers retains Kant's cosmopolitan ideal, but instead of grounding it upon rational necessity he bases it on the efforts of feeling, thinking, speaking human beings. Furthermore, by maintaining, according to Arendt, that man inhabits "islands of freedom" in a "discordant" universe, Jaspers sees that human dignity can only be realized in partial, limited ways, in a world that we can never master. This is why the spaces of freedom and dignity (note the plural) are islands in a tumultuous sea and do not cover the entirety of the earth.

Isonomy-"neither to rule nor to be ruled"-is for Arendt the ideal form of politics because this arrangement corresponds to the generic qualities of humans as such, as beings who thrive and who suffer, capable of forming limited attachments in a world of many such attachments. Another way of saying this is that our world is what we make of it, that our rights and our dignity can only be assured by our own efforts and agreements. Arendt sees that our condition does not entail or necessitate human dignity; her argument in no way falls prey to the so-called naturalistic fallacy. She recognizes that our limited condition can bring forth one of two possibilities: Either we can work out our anxiety and vulnerability by seeking to demean and oppress others, or we can seek to develop arrangements that assure the security and freedom of all. She supports the latter because she sees that the former is nothing but a recipe for suffering and mutual recrimination, as the history of conflict in our century has shown. Isonomy is her ideal because it is true to the facts of our common human condition, because it refuses to privilege any special ethnos, class, or nation, and because, acknowledging the elemental humanity of all humans and the irreducible plurality of the human world, it allows matters to be settled "through words and persuasion and not through force and violence" (1958, 26-27).

While Arendt does not frame her discussion in terms of a theory of human rights, she does make clear what she considers to be the most significant wrongs of our century: mass murder, torture, displacement; the suppression or persecution of difference; the silencing of individuals; political disenfranchisement. What these wrongs share in common is the organization of human attairs through force and violence rather than through persuasion. To the extent that words are used they are spoken in a monologue, by a dictator, who treats those below as objects of rather than participants in political power. The clearest account of these wrongs is presented in The Origins. What, Arendt asks, does the loss of human rights suffered by "the rightless" mean? First, it means the loss of the homes, of the (of course, fragile) security of existence and the familiarity provided by "the entire social texture into which they were born." Second, it means "the loss of government protection," the com-

<sup>19</sup> A quite similar point is made in connection with the problem of Third World poverty by Sen (1994).

<sup>20</sup> Arendt writes that "one is tempted to recommend the story as required reading in political science for all students who wish to learn something about the enormous power potential inherent in nonviolent action and in resistance to an opponent possessing vastly superior means of violence" (1977, 171). For a discussion of the importance of resistance to totalitarianism as a model of praxis for Arendt, see Isaac (1992 and 1993a).

<sup>21</sup> Many commentators have failed to see the importance of these themes in Arendt's writing because of an unfortunate tendency to dehistoricize Arendt. See Isaac (1993b).

plete deprivation of legal status and the civil liberties and political freedoms that are based upon one's legal standing. Finally, and most profoundly, it means the loss of one's very humanity, the lack of any recognition whatsoever, the reduction of human beings to disposable, dispensable creatures. "The fundamental deprivation of human rights is manifested," Arendt writes, "first and above all in the deprivation of a place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective. ... This extremity ... is the situation of people deprived of human rights. They are deprived, not of the right to freedom, but of the right to action; not the right to think whatever they please, but of the right of opinion. Privileges in some cases, injustices in most, blessings and doom are meted out to them according to accident and without any relation whatsoever to what they do, did, or may do" (1973, 296). Totalitarianism represents the apotheosis of such rightlessness, where the deprivation of humanity is enacted through a policy of genocide.

A perusal of Arendt's corpus can leave no doubt that her political theory represented a revolt against such wrongs, an effort to think through what it might take to guard against them. From this it is clear what values she sought to advance; the safety and bodily integrity of individuals; security of home and place from invasion and deportation; the ability to articulate one's concerns and to be heard, not simply to speak to oneself; the freedom to associate and to participate in public discourse. The failure of the rights of man, the loss of rights for so many millions of people, represented a failure to protect these things. A new guarantee of human dignity would be a way to validate them.

Arendt does not develop this theme in terms of an elaborated theory of human rights. She never lists the above values and calls for their protection. But it is wrong to conclude from this that she is hostile or indifferent toward human rights. Their very loss is what drives her theory. She is quite clear about this in The Origins. "We became aware of the existence of the right to have rights (and that means to live in a framework where one is judged by one's actions and opinions) and a right to belong to some kind of organized community," she writes, "only when millions of people emerged who had lost and could not regain these rights because of the new global situation" (1973, 297-98). We-she includes herself-became aware of the right to have rights only after the decline of the rights of man. The right to have rights was an unspecified and thus unrecognized presupposition of the rights of man proclaimed in the eighteenth century. By treating one's basic humanity as springing immediately from the nature of man, the philosophes and their heirs failed to see just how fragile this status is, how much it relies upon forms of human artifice. The nation-state was the form of artifice that made it possible for them to think this human status natural. But the nation-state has now failed, and in the wake of world war it has become clear that the humanity of individuals needs a new guarantee. The question, Arendt avers, is whether "the right to have rights, or the right of every individual to belong to humanity, should be guaranteed by humanity itself." "It is by no means certain," she allows, "whether this is possible," but there

is no doubt that she considers it desirable, indeed, imperative.

In The Origins Arendt uses the language of rights, the right to have rights, in order to speak about a new guarantee for human dignity. In some of her more philosophical works she develops a different vocabulary, of "praxis" or "public freedom," but she does so in order to confront the same problem-the need to redress the rightlessness prevalent in the late modern world. The theme of dignity remains constant, a reminder of the Kantian problem that grounds her political theorizing.

Does this make Arendt a theorist of human rights? No. But it does make her a theorist of the politics made necessary by a world that despoils human rights. The "right to have rights," she believes, can only be secured by politics, by the civic initiative of those vulnerable to the vagaries of world politics and those in solidarity with them. Perhaps the reason Arendt refuses to articulate her constructive political theory in terms of human rights is that she believes such rights have been specified often enough. What has been lacking is an understanding of how such rights might be rendered valid. Arendt's principal point is that such rights do not speak for themselves; nor do weighty declarations of intent speak for them. Such rights are mute, and invisible, unless spoken for, unless made actionable.22 They cannot exist without a politics to back them up. Arendt's theory of politics-her conception of action, her emphasis on citizenship and the power that derives from concerted action-represents an effort to help back them up. It does so by emphasizing those generic features of human existence which make possible an elemental human dignity; which, paradoxically, can only be realized in partial communities, forms of national, ethnic, and other identity that are not all-encompassing; and which rest on political commitment and artifice rather than anything given in the human condition.

#### HUMAN RIGHTS AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICS

Arendt is fully aware of the paradoxical character of her argument. As she puts it in The Origins, it requires "new law on earth, whose validity this time must comprehend the whole of humanity while its power remains strictly limited." As heirs to Hobbes and Rousseau, we are accustomed to equating "validity" with "power" and to equating both with the principle of sovereignty. While such thinkers as Grotius, Locke, and Kant imagined the existence of valid principles of universal right, they, too, saw the state as the unproblematic vehicle of such principles; politically speaking, the only source of positive law, of validation, was the sovereign state. Arendt's paradoxical formulation seeks to shake us of this habit. She insists that, somehow, universal principles might have validity-might be effective, backed up, enforced, in a way in which they are not at present-amid a world of

<sup>22</sup> On this score there are, I believe, similarities between Arendt and Claude Lefort (1986), particularly regarding Lefort's notion of a "right to have rights," that is, the power to articulate rights claims. It is ironic that Lefort (1988, 55) misses this similarity in his essay on Arendt.

limited, bounded communities. In some of her more political writings she suggests how political institutions might validate such universal principles.

One such institution is constitutional government itself. A recurrent theme of Arendt's writing is the importance of limits in political life. While not a liberal, she shared the liberal view that constitutional limits on state power are indispensable to political freedom. This sentiment is developed in the conclusion of The Origins, where Arendt writes about how laws serve as "fences" establishing boundaries between men and protecting "essential freedoms" (1973, 465-66). It is also developed in her much later On Revolution, in which she contrasts the French Revolutionary naiveté about rights with the seriousness with which the Americans treated the "legal personality" of the individual, a seriousness demonstrated by the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution (1977a, 108). Perhaps Arendt's strongest statement of this theme appears in a 1953 criticism of McCarthyism, in which she vigorously defends the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. "Dissent belongs to this living matter |the republic| as much as consent does. The limitations on dissent are the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and no one else. If you try to 'make America more American' ... you can only destroy it. Your methods, finally, are the methods of the police, and only of the police" (1953b, 599).

The protection of civil liberties afforded by a constitutional republic represents a crucial hedge against the kind of "rightlessness" Arendt fears. But in a world governed by the logic of national sovereignty Arendt believed such a hedge to be doubly limited. One crucial challenge to constitutionalism is provided by the logic of "national security," which functioned, especially during the Cold War, to create a climate of fear and to empower unaccountable and in some ways extraconstitutional police and military agencies, "national security managers" unconcerned with civil liberties. This is a major theme of one of Arendt's later collections of essays, Crises of the Republic, though it was first developed by Arendt in the 1950s. The second limit of constitutionalism is presented by the exclusionary character of even the most constitutionally oriented nationstate. The problem, in short, is that constitutionally based civil liberties are only valid for those who fall under the "jurisdiction" of the nation-state and are considered "full members" of it. The stateless, the refugee, and the citizen of dictatorships beyond the bounds of the constitutional state are thus removed from its protections.23 While the constitutional republic was thus something of great value, it is not up to the task of remedying the crisis of human rights. Indeed, as a nation-state in a system of national sovereignties, it is part of the problem.

This is why Arendt saw more global institutions as being necessary. One such institution is an effective system of international jurisprudence capable of adjudicating human rights violations. This is a major concern of Eichmann in Jerusalem. Most commentators have focused on Arendt's treatment of Eichmann's "banality," but the last quarter of the essay deals in great detail with the legalities surrounding his trial. Arendt's argues that Eichmann's crime poses profound challenges to traditional standards of jurisprudence. Whereas the traditional categories for handling war crimes-"acts of state" and "on superior orders"-consider these crimes as deviations from the general proscription against murder assumed to be recognized among all civilized nations, the Nazi genocide presents the case of "a state founded upon criminal principles." The Nazi policy of extermination presents a kind of normalized criminality, with global aspirations, unanticipated by traditional jurisprudence. The postwar Nuremburg Charter and trials, which distinguished between "crimes against peace," "war crimes," and "crimes against humanity," marked a recognition of the need for a supranational conception of humanity and human rights. Genocide, Arendt avers, ıs "an attack upon human diversity as such, that is, upon a characteristic of the "human status" without which the very words 'mankind' and 'humanity' would be devoid of meaning." In the wake of genocide, she insists, it is necessary to find a new way of protecting this diversity, of giving some "validity" to humanity. She thus reproaches the Jerusalem court for charging Eichmann only with war crimes against the Jewish people and for not facing squarely the challenge posed by this new type of crime: "The supreme crime it [the court] was confronted with, the physical extermination of the Jewish people, was a crime against humanity, perpetrated upon the body of the Jewish people" (1977b, 255, 268-69).

Yet, Arendt sees that the Israelis were hardly unique in their narrow interpretation of the Nazi crimes. The Israeli trial, she maintains against its critics, was no different from the Successor trials held in Poland, Yugoslavia, and elsewhere in Europe to deal with crimes against nations. All of these trials, unfortunately, remained trapped in the framework of national sovereignty, exclusively focused on the crimes committed against their particular nationals. They thus passed over the chance to rethink the legal principles of human order and state sovereignty. That is, they used the trials to consolidate the nation-state rather than as an opportunity to rethink it.

In this light Arendt recommends the Genocide Convention adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1948, which provided that "persons charged with genocide . . . shall be tried by a competent tribunal of the States in the territory of which the act was committed or by such international penal tribunal as may have jurisdiction." She argues that this convention, when interpreted in light of the crimes committed by the Nazis against the Jewish people, has radical implications. The most significant is the possibility that the territorial principle might be reformulated in such a way that it applied to Israel, a

<sup>23</sup> Both of these limits, together, were experienced by Arendt in a very personal way during the 1950s, when she feared that her husband, Heinrich Blucher, might be deported for his radicalism under the terms of the McCarran-Walters Security Act, which allowed for the expulsion of foreign-born and thus tainted "subversives." See Young-Bruehl (1978, 288). As Blucher wrote to Arendt: "It seems that one can now deprive someone of citizenship with a simple denunciation. . . . And how soon these 'Born American' people could become a Master Race" (ibid., p. 275).

political community which, of course, was not in existence at the time of the Nazi genocide. Regarding this possibility, Arendt holds that "no State of Israel would ever have come into being if the Jewish people had not created and maintained its own in-between space throughout the long centuries of dispersion, that is, prior to the seizure of its old territory" (1977b, 262-63). The Jewish people, in other words, had until recently been a dispersed historical nation detached from any state or sovereignty. As such, they had been perennially vulnerable to persecution and unable confidently to claim the rights afforded to fully national citizens. Insofar as the Jewish people had lacked a state, they had lacked the recognition afforded to sovereign nations by international law. Thus, individual Jews lacked the security and freedom that could only be provided by membership in a recognized, sovereign nation. For jurisprudence to recognize, even retroactively, the crimes committed against the Jews, and to sanction adjudication of these crimes by Jewish authorities, would represent nothing less than "a new political principle," the principle that peoples might have authority in the absence of sovereignty and that their members might have recognizable rights in spite of their minority status within existing states. The principle of human rights, a principle of universal validity, would thus be sanctioned by authorities "rooted in and controlled by newly defined territorial entities."

Of course, this raises a thicket of practical problems regarding competing jurisdictions. To say that Israel, as the new political authority of the Jewish people, had jurisdiction over Eichmann for crimes committed against Jews is not easy to reconcile with a number of equally plausible claims, among them: (1) a number of nations, including Poles but also gypsies, equally without a state, could claim similar jurisdiction over Eichmann; and (2) an international body might claim jurisdiction, analogous to the Nuremberg Court, for crimes against humanity. Arendt does not explore these difficulties in any detail. But before one leaps too quickly to the conclusion that her suggestions are impractical, it is important to consider what they are designed to accomplish: the relaxation of the principle of sovereignty and a modification of the idea that there is any neat correspondence between territorial residence, communal membership, and legal responsibility.

The important principle she establishes is that individuals might have internationally recognized rights even when they are members of national minorities who lack any territorially based sovereignty. While the implementation of this principle does raise difficult questions, the institutions to which Arendt seems committed attempt to resolve them. In fact, the major constructive argument of Eichmann is not a defense of a redefinition of the territorial principle that would enable disenfranchised national minorities to adjudicate crimes committed against their people. It is the endorsement of a "permanent international criminal court" based upon the Nuremberg Principles, something also called for by Arendt's teacher Karl Jaspers (1977b, 270-73; see also Jaspers 1961). Such a court would have the power to

hear human rights cases brought by aggrieved individuals and groups and to render verdicts in these cases. Such verdicts would have the force of reason behind them. They would stand as symbols of justice, and the court would serve as a kind of moral conscience of the world.24 But it might also have a more potent political sanction if a more federal system of global politics could be constituted.

Arendt does not propose new forms of legal authority as mere adjuncts to existing national sovereignties. She offers them as alternatives to the exclusive claims of such sovereignties. Her position on this matter is spelled out most clearly in her "Karl Jaspers: Citizen of the World." This essay, published in 1968, more than a decade after The Human Condition, demonstrates Arendt's continuous and consistent concern with the problems of human dignity delineated in The Origins. Arendt tells us that she seeks to rehabilitate the Kantian cosmopolitan ideal in a world in which "the most potent symbol of the unity of mankind is the remote possibility that atomic weapons used by one country . . . might ultimately come to be the end of all human life on earth." She argues that the common vulnerability of humans should lead to a new "global responsibility ... a process of mutual understanding and progressing self-clarification on a gigantic scale" (1968, 83-84).25

How might such understanding come about? Arendt argues that it cannot be on the basis of "a universal agreement upon one religion, one philosophy, or form of government"; given the diversity of cultures in the world, such a unity could only be achieved by the force of imposition, at the cost of enormous bloodshed and cruelty. She thus rejects world government as an invidiously utopian ideal which ignores the real differences of nationality, culture, and political identity that constitute the world. Instead, she recommends the principle of federation, a principle consistent with both the diversity of communities and the need to relax the political energies and tensions bound up with national sovereignty. A federal arrangement would require "the renunciation, not of one's own tradition and national past, but of the binding authority which tradition and past have always claimed" (1968, 93). Arendt supports what Jurgen Habermas has more recently called a "posttraditional national identity," a political identity capable of renouncing any kind of chauvinism and reflexively acknowledging its own partiality in a world of many nations and communities (Habermas 1990, 1992; see also Tamir 1993, Kristeva 1994). She also calls for the establishment of new regional and international forms of cooperation that might override the centralizing tendencies of state forms and might encourage new forms of regional and international identity and moral responsibility. In such a world the verdicts of international tribunals might not appear as infringements of a national sovereignty that is treated as absolute but as statements of higher principles that are commonly acknowledged.

<sup>24</sup> For a recent endorsement of this idea, based explicitly on the writings of Arendt, see Finkelkraut (1992).

<sup>25</sup> This sentiment was developed in a very influential way by Schell (1979), who explicitly credits the influence of Arendt.

In a world in which the principle of national sovereignty, and its corollary principle of justice (one nation, one army), gave way to other forms of collective security, such verdicts might even have the force of arms. And in such a world new forms of national and regional autonomy short of sovereignty might be imaginable.

Arendt had hoped such new forms might come into existence in the postwar Middle East. Her writings on this subject provide the clearest picture of how the practice of human rights might function amid new forms of international politics. For Arendt the greatest tragedy of the Arab-Jewish conflict that broke out into full-scale war in May 1948 was that each side confronted the other with claims "which are nationalistic because they make sense only in the closed framework of one's own people and history, and legalistic because they discount the concrete factors of the situation" (1978, 201). In the face of such absolutist claims, she insisted that the only way to save lives and preserve the integrity of the peoples involved was to establish a binational, confederal state, based on forms of local self-government and Jewish-Arab economic cooperation. Rejecting national sovereignty as a recipe for disaster, she envisioned a political community with multiple and overlapping levels of authority, in which national identities would be respected but in which they would not be the exclusive bases of political power and citizenship.26

Lest this vision of regional and global federation be viewed as too "idealistic," it is important to see that Arendt considered it anti-Utopian in at least two senses. For her, it was precisely the existence of profound differences and antagonisms between and among individuals, communities, nations, and states that made federation superior to world government. It is world government, a politics based upon a naive vision of global citizenship and unmediated human identity, that is idealistic.27 It could never be effective, because it could never sustain a significant level of commitment and civic initiative in a world of deep and irremediable differences and antagonisms. These same differences and antagonisms, which had erupted in bloody conflict and demonstrated such callous inhumanity in our century, also made federation preferable to the laissez-faire principle of national sovereignty. Laissez-faire is simply a recipe for doing nothing, for allowing world politics to proceed as usual, while the millions who are refugees and national minorities remain displaced and disenfranchised, and the rest remain subjects to increasingly remote and irresponsible sovereign states. Federation, in other words, was for Arendt an arrangement made practically necessary by the failures of political responsibility in the twentieth century, a responsibility made imperative by the serious problems besetting us. Far from imagining an end to such problems, Arendt proposes federation as a way of managing them, of regulating national differences and of securing human rights in a world in which the need for such efforts has no terminus.

## THE PRAXIS OF HUMAN RIGHTS

Just as Arendt saw global federalism as a form of politics, a process of resolving differences, she also saw such institutions as themselves always relying upon more elementary forms of politics. Federalism is not a blueprint, much less a panacea. It is a possibility intimated by certain forms of existing politics, an always uncompleted project animated by vigorous political agencies. Arendt's political theory not only was driven by the distinctively modern problems of superfluity, displacement, and homelessness but also was inspired by contemporary forms of political action. The defense of Alfred Dreyfus spearheaded by Clemenceau and Jaures; the French and Danish resistance to the Nazis; the Ihud group of binationalist Zionists led by her friend Judah Magnes; the U.S. civil rights and antiwar movements; groups such as Amnesty International and PEN, all these efforts exemplify a politics of resistance to state actions that displace and degrade human beings in the name of oppressive ideologies. While they can be viewed as altruistic or humanitarian attempts to relieve human suffering, they are also forms of concerted action and political empowerment. The Danes who assisted Jews under the Nazi occupation, for example, were not simply acting out of altruistic concern for others. They were also acknowledging a connection with the Jews, the connection of a common subjection to Nazi power as well as a common humanity. And in acting on this acknowledgment they asserted their dignity in the face of oppression and danger. Thus, their humanitarianism, if you will, was transformed through their common opinions and their collective action into a politics.28

Such examples of political praxis illustrate two of the most important features of Arendt's vision of the politics of human dignity. The first is that the most important locus of such a politics is neither the nation-state nor the international covenant or tribunal. These are, of course, crucial loci of power. The nation-state is still the preeminent political actor on the world scene. Constitutional limitations on the exercise of state power, forms of federated authority, and international legal codes-each a way of placing a kind of constraint upon state sovereignty-are all necessary if the rights of minorities, refugees, and dissenters are to be secured. But the primary impetus for such rights will always come from elsewhere, from the praxis of citizens who insist upon these rights and who are prepared to back up this insistence through political means. The words of Albert Camus are apposite: "Little is to be expected from present-day governments, since these live and act according to a murderous code. Hope remains only in the most difficult task of all: to reconsider everything from the ground up, so as to shape a living society inside a dying society. Men must therefore, as individuals, draw up among themselves, within frontiers and across them, a new social contract, which will unite them according to more reasonable principles" (1991, 135-36).

Arendt's essays "Civil Disobedience" and On Revolu-

<sup>26</sup> On this subject see Isaac (1992) and Barnouw (1990). For a more recent argument along these lines, see Heller and Nusseibeh (1991). 27 Arendt writes: "Politics deals with men, nationals of many countries and heirs to many pasts" (1968, 81).

<sup>28</sup> See Arendt (1977a, 88-89) for an interesting discussion of the difference between the sentiments of compassion and pity and solidarity, the latter "a principle that can guide action."

tion take up this very theme of a new social contract. Both deal with the subject of resistance to moribund and oppressive power and treat this resistance as a prefiguration of a new politics centered upon voluntary associations and council forms rather than formal or official state institutions. The "lost treasure" of the revolutionary tradition is, for Arendt, the model of an associational politics that exists beneath and across frontiers, shaking up the boundaries of the political and articulating alternative forms of allegiance, accountability, and citizenship (see Isaac 1994). Echoing Camus, Arendt writes that if there exists an alternative to national sovereignty, then it is such an associational politics, which works according to "a completely different principle of organization, which begins from below, continues upward, and finally leads to a parliament." She quickly adds that the details of such a politics are less important than its civic spirit, a spirit that resists the deracinating tendencies of modern political life (1972, 231-33).29 That such a politics runs against the principle of sovereignty is for Arendt one of its strengths. As many commentators have observed, there is a deep pathos to Arendt's treatment of revolution, which is for her a glorious, empowering, and yet evanescent phenomenon, like a fire that burns brightly for only a moment (see Miller 1979). Arendt recognized the paradox of rebellion in the modern world, namely, that powerful associational impulses would be coopted by more official forms of politics. Yet, this can be viewed as the great virtue of this kind of politics-that it challenges the status quo and calls attention to itself in ways which demand redress and incorporation. In other words, such forms of resistance invigorate formal politics and keep it true to the spirit of human dignity. Their vigilant insistence gives force to the support for human rights that is proclaimed, but often honored in the breach, by more authoritative domestic and international bodies.

The second important feature of Arendt's vision of the politics of human dignity is that there is no single community, or single category of citizenship, that can once and for all solve the problem of human rights in the late modern world. One arena of human rights praxis is clearly the state itself, and one kind of citizenship appropriate to it is clearly what we think of as "domestic" citizenship-membership in the nation state as an American, or Italian, or Croatian. But it should be clear that the idea of "domestic" is simply an adjunct of the idea of sovereignty itself; it denotes those matters contained within the boundaries of sovereign power and subject to it. As such it encourages domesticity where vigor is also needed. For there is no reason to imagine that relevant human rights issues, or relevant communities, correspond to the boundaries of nation-states. Local, regional, and global forms of citizenship are equally possible and equally real. One can speak about the rights of aborigines, for example, as a Mohawk, as a Canadian, as a North American, as a human. In each case different forms of organization would be appropriate; in each case one would speak to a different, though

not necessarily mutually exclusive, audience. How human rights claims are articulated and mobilized can and will vary from case to case and from time to time, as political identities are transformed and new alliances forged.30

It would be equally mistaken to conflate ideas of community and citizenship with formal political organizations, be they states, nations, or confederations. In On Revolution Arendt writes about self-chosen "elites," groups of citizens distinguished by nothing but their deep interest and participation in specific public matters. She describes such elites as constituting, through their very own efforts, "elementary republics." In the Arendtian view it is possible to imagine a multiplicity of overlapping "republics," sometimes in tension with one another, sometimes in support of one another. The kinds of international legal institutions and federated state arrangements that she endorses would constitute ineffective security for human rights were they not authorized, empowered, and invigorated by a robust civil society of such "republics."

The Helsinki Citizens' Assembly, formed in 1990 as an outgrowth of links formed between East European dissidents and West European peace activists after the Helsinki Accords in 1975, is an interesting example of what Arendt might have envisioned.31 As Mary Kaldor, a co-founder, describes the assembly, "it is not addressed to governments except in so far as they are asked to guarantee freedom of travel and freedom of assembly so that citizens' groups can meet and communicate. It is a strategy of dialogue, an attempt to change society through the actions of citizens rather than governments . . . in short, to create a new political culture. In such a situation, the behavior of governments either changes or becomes less and less relevant" (Kaldor 1989, 15). The assembly has been described as a loose association of citizens acting together in self-organized associations, movements, and initiatives across national boundaries. It is hardly indifferent to the policies of governments; petitioning, demonstrating, and fostering debate about state policies regarding human rights have been central to its activities. But the power that its members have been able to constitute is an important force in its own right; indeed, it is only because of this power, an organizational and an ethical power, that it is capable of supporting more directly "political" efforts, such as legislation, and of influencing the course of state action. According to Kaldor, "we don't represent anyone except the movements and institutions in which we are involved. In many cases, we represent no one but ourselves. And our power rests not on whom we represent but in what we do-in what we say, in our ideas, in our quest for truth, in the projects we undertake. It rests on our energy and commitment" (Kaldor 1991, 215).

Groups such as the Helsinki Citizens' Assembly and Amnesty International embody the kind of associational politics central to Arendt's conception of modern citi-

zenship. They are forms of collective empowerment that might provide a new foundation for human dignity. They play an indispensable role in calling attention to human rights abuses, giving voice to the disenfranchised and persecuted, and empowering citizens to act in concert on behalf of the expansion of rights. They seek not only to alter state policies, for example, on matters such as minority and refugee rights, but also to offer their own, unofficial support for displaced or persecuted people. A group such as Spanish Refugee Aid, with which Arendt was involved, was no substitute for state policies hospitable to the rights of Spanish refugees, nor was it a substitute for diplomatic efforts to change a dictatorial regime; but the voluntary organization of relief efforts and forms of solidarity is itself an indispensable and preeminently political effort, without which more hospitable state policies would not be possible. Not a wholesale alternative to other, more inclusive or official, forms of political community, such endeavors themselves constitute vital forms of civic participation and empowerment. They can be viewed as "elementary republics" of citizens committed to human rights.

Our world is in many ways different from the one Arendt described in her Preface to the first edition of The Origins of Totalitarianism. Writing in 1951, with the recent experiences of world war and Holocaust seared into her memory, and another world conflict dangerously imminent, she noted that "this moment of anticipation is like the calm that settles after all hopes have died" (1973, vii). From her perspective the world, still reeling after the traumatic shocks of totalitarianism and mass destruction, seemed to be hurtling toward other, no less disturbing, forms of violence and human suffering.

In contrast, we are witnesses to the end of the Cold War. Our more optimistic contemporaries, invoking Hegel with apparent conviction, only yesterday proclaimed the end of history and the triumph of liberal democracy. Yet, few today are sanguine about the state of the world. As I write this essay millions of innocent civilians are starving in Rwanda and Kenya, the victims of brutal civil conflict. Kurds in Iraq and Turkey, Tamils in Sri Lanka, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, and countless other national minorities clamor for human rights. In the heart of Europe, Sarajevo is under Serbian siege, and Bosnian Muslims suffer a brutal, murderous campaign of "ethnic cleansing."32 German neo-Nazi youth regularly vandalize and burn refugee hostels, to the cheers of large crowds of sympathetic bystanders. Throughout France, Italy, and Germany there are increasingly audible calls to exclude "foreigners" in the name of "real citizens," "true" French, or Italians, or Germans who do not wish to share their country with the others. Across the Atlantic Ocean things are no different, as the Clinton administration recently turned back Haitian refugees fleeing a brutal dictatorship, just as its predecessors had done before with refugees displaced by economic trauma and civil war in El Salvador and Guatemala (see United Nations 1993, Zolberg 1989).

The 1992 Human Rights Watch World Report notes

that in the wake of the Cold War "respect for human rights faces a dangerous challenge in the rise of exclusionary ideologies . . . the quest for ethnic, linguistic or religious purity, pursued by growing numbers, lies behind much of today's bloodshed. By closing the community to diversity and stripping outsiders of essential rights, these dangerous visions of enforced conformity nourish a climate of often brutal intolerance" (1992, 1). Arendt, writing more than forty years ago, observed that "under the most diverse conditions and disparate circumstances, we watch the development of the same phenomena-homelessness on an unprecedented scale, rootlessness to an unprecedented depth" (1973, vii). Such a vision sounds grimly familiar.

While Arendt is not a theorist well known for her reflections on human rights, her writing is an indispensable resource for thinking about the threats to human dignity in the late modern world. As she recognized, human rights are not a given of human nature; they are the always tenuous results of a politics that seeks to establish them, a vigorous politics intent on constituting relatively secure spaces of human freedom and dignity. And as she saw, the nation-state, far from being the vehicle of the self-determination of individuals and peoples, is in many ways an obstacle to the dignity that individuals and communities seek. Those interested in human rights, who wish to provide a new guarantee for human dignity, have no alternative but to take responsibility upon themselves, to act politically as members of elementary republics, locally and globally, on behalf of a dignity that is in perpetual jeopardy in the world in which we live. As the Human Rights Watch Report makes chillingly clear, such a politics is hardly a matter of mere academic interest.
