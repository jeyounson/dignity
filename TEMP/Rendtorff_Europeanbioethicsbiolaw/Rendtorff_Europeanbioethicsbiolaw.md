**Abstract.** This article summarizes some of the results of the BIOMED II project "Basic Ethical Principles in European Bioethics and Biolaw" (1995–1998) connected to a research project of the Danish Research Councils "Bioethics and Law" (1993–1998). The BIOMED project was based on cooperation between 22 partners in most EU countries. The aim of the project was to identify the ethical principles of respect for autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability as four important ideas or values for a European bioethics and biolaw. The research concluded that the basic ethical principles cannot be understood as universal everlasting ideas or transcendental truths but they rather function reflective guidelines and important values in European culture. The method of the research was conceptual, philosophical analysis of the cultural background of the four values or normative ideas that people use and find important in their existence. Moreover, this was combined with analysis of empirical legal material and policy documents. Also, a number of qualitative interviews with relevant experts were carried out. Another important result of the BIOMED project was the partner's Policy Proposals to the European Commission, *the Barcelona Declaration*, unique as a philosophical and political agreement between experts in bioethics and biolaw from many different countries. The Policy Proposals are reprinted here at the end of the article.

**Key words:** autonomy, bioethics, biolaw, dignity, Europe, integrity, vulnerability

## **Introduction**

In this paper I will discuss the major themes of our investigation of basic ethical principles in European bioethics and biolaw in order to give an overview of our interpretation of the facts and opinions on the basic ethical principles in different European countries. The analysis of the principles simply presents a range of uses, descriptions and understandings of the principles in different biomedical contexts and cultures. The paper defines the scope of the principles and it indicates limits to the possible uses of the principles. In the first part, I discuss the definition of the basic ethical principles. In the second part, I present some of their applications in European legislations.

## **Why these principles?**

In the research project we started out with the methodological presupposition that the philosophy of the basic ethical principles, autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability, can provide a normative framework for the protection of the human person in

biomedical development (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000). The important question is "what do we want humanity to be like"? (Sève, 1994: 26). I would argue that the basic ethical principles express the necessary protection of humanity and the human person as guidelines for a future European politics in bioethics and biolaw. We can say that they indicate the political morality of the medical and legal systems in the European Union. In this regard, basic ethical principles may be mobilised to protect the "privacy" of the human person confronted with technological development. At the same time, the principles can be understood as the foundation of a European policy on human rights. The application of the principles can be extended to other fields of legal practice e.g. social law and administration. As indicating respect for persons as ends-inthemselves in a European legal culture the applications of the principles reflects the cultural differences and local variations in Europe (Häberle, 1997). Such a cultural regionalism is built on the idea of subsidiarity, where each European state makes use of the principles according to the particularity of their specific convictions.

We argue that the basic ethical principles are

applied in different ways in the various concrete fields of biomedicine (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 63–141). We can observe that they increasingly become an integrated part of medical practice in the health care institutions. Concepts of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability are not only deduced from universal standards, they are also and primarily induced from the particular situations of application. However, it is important to promote the principles in national legislation and legal practice, for example by the development of National Ethics Committees in all European states. The committees are necessary for shaping the ethics advisory function of development and application of the principles. But the principles are institutionalised in various ways in the different European countries (Rendtorff et al., 2000: 143–181). The result is that they are put to work in different ways either as a comprehensive biomedical legislation, as is the case in for example in France and Norway, where they are integrated parts of the constitution, or in a more liberal framework as in Denmark and The Netherlands. In such a manner the principles are of great importance as general guidelines for the harmonisation of European policies in bioethics and biolaw.

When we look at the practical applications in legal and biomedical practice in European countries we can perceive that the basic ethical principles are defined as "middle level" principles, between visions of the good life for the human person and norms for concrete cases of application. At a more basic level we can justify these applications by the fact that the principles may be presupposed to find their conceptual and empirical foundation in anthropology of the bodily-incarnated human being (Merleau-Ponty, 1945). We may say that the principles provide the normative foundations for required respect for the human body. Empirically, this argument is enforced by a continuing concern for the human body in European biolaw. Moreover, the principles evoke the concern of respect for the human body. There is an ongoing personalisation of the body (Lenoir and Matthieu, 1998). On this basis the basic ethical principles are promoted as guidelines for the required legal respect for the human body that can be included in the European legislations on bioethics and biolaw as respect for human persons. They are guidelines for biomedical ethics and in particular for medical deontology as a comprehensive part of clinical medical practice.

I want to emphasise that it is very important not to interpret the principles of dignity, integrity and vulnerability exclusively in an anthropocentric fashion. They should rather be built on the consideration of the human person in the larger life-context and life-world of living nature (Westra, 1994). We might discuss of to which extend the principles can be "common ethical principles" for human beings, animals and nature. We have investigated the extent to which the principles apply to animals and other living organisms as an indication of how the principles could be made into guidelines for legal practice and legislation on these matters. The extension of the sphere of legal and ethical concern to apply to the whole biosphere, nature and animals is necessary in an age of increased human intervention in the living nature.

## **The definitions of the ethical principles**

A very important part of our research has been to propose a conceptual clarification of the basic ethical principles as a methodological foundation of normative and empirical application. The following definition was based on hermeneutic analysis of the possible uses of the ethical principles combined with critical analysis of their philosophical content. We may justify the principles within a phenomenology of moral values in human intersubjective relations. The definitions were also based on empirical analysis of uses of the principles in different European countries.

Accordingly, autonomy is not only to be defined in the liberal sense as "permission" (Engelhardt, 1986, 1996). Rather, five important meanings of autonomy can be put forward: 1) autonomy as capacity of creation of ideas and goals for life, 2) autonomy as capacity of moral insight, "self-legislation" and privacy, 3) autonomy as capacity of decision and action with lack of outer constraint, 4) autonomy as capacity of political involvement and personal responsibility, 5) autonomy as capacity of informed consent (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 25). Autonomy should be considered as a principle of the self-legislation of rational human beings taking part in the same human life world. This does not exclude the recognition of pluralism as a political fact of modern society. But it is necessary to work with a more comprehensive idea of autonomy, recognising the tensions between different conceptions of the good. The republican sense of autonomy is based on the vision of "the good life for and with the other in just institutions" (Ricœur, 1990: 202). This vision is put forward as the basis for privacy, confidentiality and informed consent.

Autonomy is not considered as the only fundamental concept in bioethics and biolaw. Autonomy remains merely an ideal because of its structural limitations i.e. human dependence on outer factors, lack of information, reduced capacity of reasoning etc. This limitation of the concept of autonomy is also due to tension between the human existence as an unencumbered self and the embodied, embedded, character of human experience. We must recognise

the human person as a situated subject. In any case, autonomy is not a sufficient normative concept to ensure ethical and legal protection in relation to a number of subjects: minors, coma patients and the mentally ill, etc.

Dignity cannot be reduced to autonomy (Knoppers, 1991). Rather, dignity is defined both as an intrinsic value and as a matter for constructive morality in human relationships (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 31) It expresses the outstanding position of human beings in the universe. It refers to the inviolability of individual human life. It further expresses the moral responsibility of the human person. This idea of dignity must be respected in the intersubjective relations of the kingdom of ends-in-themselves. On this basis, I would argue that human dignity has the following meanings as an intersubjective concept: 1) It expresses the intrinsic value of the human being in a community or society. 2) It includes respect for the moral agency of the human subject. 3) It means that every human being must be considered as being without a price and unable to be commercialised. 4). This includes that human dignity refers to the indeterminant position of human beings in the universe – as they are able to create their own destiny. 5) Selfesteem, to be proud, shame, feeling of inferiority and degradation are essentially matters of human dignity expressed in the intersubjective relations between individuals. 6) Dignity can establish restrictions on interventions in human beings in taboo-situations, because of the necessity of human civilised behaviour. 7) Finally, dignity relates to metaphysical experiences of human beings in existential limit by degrading treatment. But the relation between rights and dignity is also essential. In that context human dignity expresses the intrinsic worth and fundamental equality of all human beings.

The principle of integrity may be said to refer to the totality of life saying that it should not be destroyed (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 38). Integrity is a coherence that in a certain sense must not be touched. This coherence, or rather "Lebenszusammenhang" is the narrative coherence of a person's life (the life story) or the narrative (historical) unity of human culture. On this basis, integrity has four meanings. 1) Integrity as a narrative totality, wholeness, completeness. 2) Integrity as a personal sphere of self-determination. 3) Integrity as a virtue of uncorrupted character, expressing uprightness, honesty and good character. 4) Integrity as a legal notion, where it expresses the moral coherence of the legal or medical system. In bioethics and biolaw the idea of integrity as an untouchable core, the personal sphere, which should not be subject to external intervention, is the most important. The personal body must be considered

in a phenomenological perspective of the self-mastery of the body. Integrity expresses bodily completeness in a private sphere. In medicine it is indispensable for trust between physician and patient. Because there is a close link between respect for identity and respect for integrity where a personal narrative expresses the life context of the individual. In this way, respect for integrity is recognition of the right to privacy and constitutes the virtues of the legal and medical systems.

Vulnerability of mental and corporeal life is closely linked to integrity. But it expresses more characteristics of the human condition (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 45). Protection of vulnerability is considered as the bridging factor between moral strangers in a pluralistic society and therefore respect for vulnerability is essential to policy making in the modern welfare state. Vulnerability should be considered as a universal expression of the human condition (Levinas, 1961) Moreover, it appeals to protection of both animals and the teleological auto-organisation of the world. However, vulnerability has been largely misunderstood in modern society, which has been guided by a so-called vulnerability reducing agenda, which aims to eliminate all vulnerability, i.e. suffering, abnormality, deafness and disability, in order to create perfect human beings (Kemp, Rendtorff and Mattsson, 2000; Callahan, 1993). Respect for vulnerability must find the right balance between this logic of the struggle for immortality and the finitude of the earthly presence of human suffering. As an expression of the destiny of finitude the moral receptivity of vulnerability, i.e. the respect for the vulnerability of the other, is the foundation of ethics in our time (Kass, 1985).

I would argue that medicine relates to suffering as expressed by this twofold vulnerability. It is called to re-establish the natural balance of the human body and organism (Ganguilhem, 1943). It is a normative science and art, even though modern medicine has its basis in the physiology of the organism. Because it must refer to bodily vulnerability where the human person is both object body and lived body. In this way the art of medicine is guided by the application of the basic ethical principles to the protection of the human person. Consequently, respect for vulnerability should be made more evident as the essential foundation of the treatment of human beings in the hospital and in the legal system.

On the basis of the proposed definition of the basic ethical principles, I would argue that they should be considered as legal and ethical guidelines for the patient-physician relationship in clinical practice. Respect for these principles contributes to better physician-patient communication (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 63). This implies that integrity and identity are becoming integrated accounts of the good

life. Understanding informed consent as a "pacte de soin" includes the integration of the basic ethical principles in the clinical process. Respect for persons in a communicative process is essential to the clarification of the physician-patient relationship. They are therefore the foundation of a good application of informed consent. This is a confirmation of the critical attitude towards physician paternalism that is already present in the Helsinki-Declarations concerning research on human subjects. And it is a support for the establishment of patients' rights in national legislations. It establishes self-esteem and self-respect as the foundation of informed consent. Informed consent should be extended to include patients' rights and patient democracy, as is, for example, the case in the Netherlands.

Another important methodological presupposition of the research is that the basic ethical principles should be promoted in the framework of solidarity and responsibility (Jonas, 1979). This includes the idea of a social progress towards a more developed society (Ricœur, 1995). The principles are an expression of the movement of society in the civilising process towards the "Kingdom of Ends" (Ricœur, 1995). Their application corresponds to the integration of the principles in an ethics of care. It is the task of this ethics to take care of civilisation and secure the self-realisation of human individuals in the welfare state. This involves that ideas of social insurance should be integrated in a collective responsibility of society. The basic ethical principles in the movement of civilisation constitute a change of interpretation from a contractual rights claim to a protective rights claim confronted with technological development. This shift in emphasis is the current condition for the application of the principles in the different fields of biomedicine.

## **The basic ethical principles and the European legal culture**

The conceptual and empirical clarification of the basic ethical principles was used as the foundation of empirical analysis of the applications of these values in different European countries. I want to stress the following findings in our BIOMED-II research project.

At the legal level the basic ethical principles may be viewed as expressions of important dimensions of a "European legal culture" (Häberle, 1997). They are in this way the guidelines for a European constitutional culture aiming at protection of human rights. Thus, respect for the basic ethical principles implies a move from bioethics to biolaw that situates the principles at the constitutional level. In this way the principles constitute respect for the common good and a common "Res Publica" in European societies as an expression of a just legal order.

It should be admitted, however, that the meaning and importance of the principles are very different in each of the European countries (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 143). Although there are some common frames for the discussion the principles are applied very differently in each country. Roughly, the situation in the different countries can be summarised in the following manner:

Biolaw and bioethics in *Austria* are marked by a pragmatic positivistic legal tradition that is limited by Catholic theology and a German inspired legal tradition for the protection of human dignity and integrity (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 147). There is an emerging criticism of medical paternalism that leads to an interpretation of autonomy and self-determination in a Kantian perspective on human being as end-inthemselves. Austria has no independent health law but only some regulation of singular biomedical problems.

The *Belgian* society can be seen as advocating a pluralistic approach to the bioethical problems in the context of which the notion of autonomy has a great importance (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 154). Belgium must find a balance between Northern and Southern European conceptions. Belgium is therefore an interesting test case for the formation of a Common Biolaw for Europe.

The *Danish* situation can be interpreted as being "weakly normative", where a pragmatic bureaucratic legal system has slowly become more open to ethical issues (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 161). There is still legal realism and a strong utilitarian trend present in the public debate. This has in an extensive public debate been opposed by arguments for the recognition of the basic principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability as a part of bioethics and biolaw.

The *Finnish* legal system is characterised by a mixture of Scandinavian pragmatism and German inspired natural law theory (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 170). Basic rights of freedom, dignity, integrity and equality are protected by the Finnish constitution. The principles have had some importance in relation to recent law on patient rights.

*French* bioethics and biolaw is marked by a strong principalist approach to the basic ethical principles. (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 173). The French laws on the human body apply the principles to the bodilyincarnated human person. The principles are therefore extensively present in the French debate as an interpretation of basic human rights.

*Germany* is characterised by a strong and extensive presence of the concept of human dignity in the regulation of biomedical ethics (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 181). Autonomy, integrity and vulnerability are seen in the perspective of respect for the inviolable dignity of every human being. Furthermore, there is great public scepticism towards the technological developments of biomedical science.

In *Greece* there is a relatively positive attitude to the new technologies, and the ethical principles are seen in the light of the Hippocratic tradition of medical ethics. (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 190). Due to the inspiration of Germany in Greek law the principle of human dignity is widely referred to in the Greek legislation.

The *Irish* situation is characterised by the ongoing search for peace. The Irish constitution is marked by a strong respect for human dignity related to the sanctity of life-doctrine (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 195). In particular, the state recognises the protection of the life of the un-born as essential to the idea of human dignity.

The *Italian* debate on the basic ethical principles is marked by the opposition between Catholic and secular bioethics (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 209). Also American principalism, the human rights approach and the personalistic philosophy have had an influence on the debate on bioethics. At the same time, in the reflection on natural law there is a movement away from a metaphysical conception of human nature towards a starting point in concrete bodily nature.

The *Netherlands* has a great tradition of tolerance and pluralism, due to the absence of a dominant state morality (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 209). This peaceful co-existence and self-determination is central for the regulation of bioethical problems. The Dutch regulation of patient rights is a good example of this. The liberal attitude to euthanasia also illustrates concern for autonomy.

*Norway* is a homogenous country with little pluralism. The Norwegian legislation is characterised by a strong Lutheranism and a secularised humanistic respect for human dignity and integrity. (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 217). This is opposed to utilitarian values of progress of the welfare state and industrial society. Norway has legislated a comprehensive bill on bioethical questions based on the notion of "mixed ethics".

The ideas of human dignity, integrity and autonomy are essential matters in the *Portuguese* Constitution, which is a modern welfare state constitution (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 225). But Catholic natural law thinking still has great influence as the basis of social solidarity. In Portuguese legislation on bioethics the basic ethical principles are highly valued as fundamental social virtues that are applied in each of the different fields of bioethics.

After the new constitution in 1975 *Spain* has accelerated into a pluralistic society in search of a common framework (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 231). The new utilitarian values are accompanied by the secularisation of Catholicism. The principles of autonomy, dignity and integrity have, however, great influence on the regulation of bioethics in the new democratic society. This society has a very liberal attitude to the bioethical problems.

Like the other Scandinavian countries marked by legal realism and pragmatism, *Sweden* had a constitution with little emphasis on human rights, but in 1975 dignity was introduced into the constitution (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 239). Therefore, the notions of dignity and integrity that have been related to the different fields of bioethics have increasingly determined the debate on bioethics.

*Switzerland* is marked by the most extensive use of the principles, due to the fact that the country has introduced the concept of the dignity of creation in its constitution (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 245). Bioethics is regulated in the constitution, but also locally on the level of the different cantons, so there is no uniform regulation of the different bioethical sub fields. Therefore, personal autonomy is very important, for example in relation to political selfdetermination.

The framework for the debate and discussion of bioethics in the *United Kingdom* is that of the conflict between utilitarian and human rights perspectives (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 251). The regulatory background is multi-layered and the culture is heterogeneous. The human rights perspective defends such rights as autonomy, dignity, equality and respect. Of special influence in the UK is the American principalist approach as well as the utilitarian position.

## **Towards European harmonization**

On the basis of the short description of the bioethical and legal role of the basic ethical principles in each country, we developed a comparative description of their status in the different European countries. Such a summarised picture should give an overview of their level and status of implementation in the various countries (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 258). Of special interest are the similarities and differences in the formulation of bioethics and biolaw. This is oriented towards clarification of the possible harmonisation of the principles in the European legislation in these matters. The description of the basic ethical principles in the European countries shows that pluralism is a basic fact in the interpretation and status of the principles. It is very difficult to harmonise the European legislations, which can be seen by an analysis of each biomedical field. However, it is possible to point to some general measures of interpretation of the principles in relation to different biomedical areas in the various European countries.

Most countries interpret the principles in the light of human rights. Thus bioethics and biolaw are matters of constitutional concern. Most constitutions protect the integrity and dignity of the human bodily-incarnated person and biolaw is a fundamental problem of constitutional interpretation. In Italy, Spain, Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Germany, and Sweden and to some extent France, dignity, integrity and human rights are explicitly written into the constitution, while countries like Denmark, the United Kingdom, Norway and Austria are more focussed on autonomy, though they do attach great significance to the ethical principles without defining them directly in their constitutions. But in these countries we also experience a move towards giving biolaw a constitutional basis. Moreover, looking at specific fields of law with a lack of comprehensive legislation we perceive that constitutional principles are mobilised in order to regulate the different fields of bioethics.

The basic principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability are not only ethical principles; they can also be shown to have significance for the development of international law in the EU and the Council of Europe (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 281). This legal protection of the human body is carried out in the European Commission, the European Parliament and in the Council of Europe, which has recently developed a Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine to be ratified by the various European Countries. The concept of human dignity is central to international biolaw. Moreover, European development is reflected in the formulation of Declarations in international law at the UN-level. Thus legal regulation based on the basic ethical principles should be considered as a "fourth generation of human rights" or "bio-rights" that imply a universal protection of the human person with intrinsic value as an end-in-itself.

On this basis, the work of the "Group of Advisors on Biotechnology of the European Commission" now the "European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies" has been and still is very important for the formation of a Common European Policy that is based on the respect for the basic ethical principles in a human rights framework (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 283). Moreover, the efforts of the European Parliament to make a common bioethical legislation on the basic ethical principles is also very significant. Thus the parliament should do more to secure a unified policy of harmonisation. The European Union needs more work to be done on a genuine implementation of the basic ethical principles as the foundation of human rights legislation, thereby securing the right to selfdevelopment of the human individual in the European societies.

The same sort of development can be shown in the legislative approaches of the Council of Europe. The Council's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine is an example of the implementation of the basic ethical principles in biolaw. There is a close link between protection of the basic ethical principles and protection of personal identity. But there is also an understanding of the necessity and positive value of scientific progress. The protection of the humanity of the person and its right to self-development include the formulation of a sphere of privacy based on the principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability, and linked to human rights such as the right to life, protection from degrading treatment in torture and the inviolability of the human body.

Moreover, this leads to the principle of noncommercialisation of the human body and its elements, that is: prohibition of the sale of human organs, embryos and genes. And for some it implies claims of anonymity of artificial procreation and organ transplantation. We can also mention the prohibition of germ-line therapy and human cloning, which aims to offer the best life conditions for future generations, containing the protection of their genome as a part of the rights to genetic integrity and identity: "The right to inherit a genetic pattern which has not been artificially changed". Thus, this is a new horizon for human rights in European and in international law.

However, important problems in the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine should be further discussed. Some have argued that the Convention has great difficulties in providing a European consensus. The problems of harmonisation of the use of embryos in research, organ transplantation and genetics are not solved in the Convention, which does not take a position on many important issues. Furthermore, the Convention is marked on many points by contradictions with national legislation. Although the Convention provides a common framework of minimum norms there is still a lot to be done to harmonise national and international regulation. A number of problems of the Convention, concerning protection of incapable people, the protection of the human body, the status of the embryo, organ transplantation etc. are therefore to be continuously evaluated.

## **Foundations and criticisms of the basic ethical principles**

On the basis of the analysis of the principles in Europe it is important also to present the different criticisms and justifications of the basic ethical principles in the light of social justice (Rendtorff and Kemp, 2000: 289). I would emphasize that the basic ethical principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity and vulnerability are not "free-standing". They do not exist in a "theoretical heaven" but they should be considered in the frame of justice. We are in a meta-ethical process of reconstructing the principles.

In the perspective of "soft" justification the principles should be considered as landmarks of a human rights culture at the end of the 20th century. A more ambitious justification goes even further and considers the principles in the perspective of a long road of justification based on contemporary European philosophies such as those of Paul Ricœur (1990, 1995), Emmanuel Lévinas (1961) and Jürgen Habermas (1992). On this basis the criticisms of the principles include general problems about justification, ordering and structuring of principles in bioethics and biolaw, the criticisms of the principles in different philosophical approaches; utilitarianism, casuistry, pluralism, relativism etc.

As a response to the different criticisms of the principles we can propose a vision of social justice based on the ethical principles. From the point of view of justice the principles are not interpreted as "ontological absolutes" but as reflective guidelines for bioethics and biolaw. The important justifications are the ethics of proximity (based on close encounters), universalism (based on a universal law), communitarianism (based on cultural traditions) and finally deliberative democracy (a conflict-consensual society). Thus, justification of the principles is based on a plurality of discourses and convictions in a society consisting of people with many divergent points of view.

Being aware of the wide presence of the basic ethical principles in European ethics and law we may promote them as the basis for future initiatives in bioethics and biolaw. We may consider the rights of the individual to his or her own body as fundamental human rights. Regulation of biomedical problems is considered as an exercise of reflective legal and legislative judgement guided by basic ethical principles. Moreover, this is present in the extension of human rights to include rights in relation to the human body and its parts. A special sphere of protection of human beings, between person and thing, is defined. The concepts of non-commercialisation and anonymity of donation of human body parts are mentioned as, for very different reasons, controversial supplementary principles.

Finally, biolaw and the implied bio rights may be considered as a vision of the person as an end in-it-self, an expression of "political morality" and "integrity" (Dworkin, 1986). Biolaw is determined by a large degree of exposure, or openness, of the judicial system to the outside world of politics and culture. On the basis of their pluralistic interpretations in the different European countries, the ethical principles are very important as guidelines and reflective ideas for developing a common policy, when it is thought appropriate, necessary and in accordance with respect for the principles of subsidiarity in the EU-institutions and the Council of Europe. This realisation of the basic principles helps to develop a new generation of human rights in international bioethics and biolaw.

## **Appendix: The Barcelona Declaration Policy Proposals**

To the European Commission, November 1998, by Partners in the BIOMED-II Project, Basic Ethical Principles in Bioethics and Biolaw

## *A. Preamble*

This document is the result of a process of discussion undertaken in a three-year EU BIOMED research project by a group of 22 partners based in different countries within the enlarged European Economic Community and coordinated by the Centre for Ethics and Law in Copenhagen. The partners were drawn from several different disciplines and horizons but their common interest was in ethical questions raised by the progress in modern biomedicine and biotechnology.

This process consisted of four big meetings (Copenhagen, Sheffield, Utrecht, Barcelona) and ongoing debate between the partners. It resulted in a two-volume publication (Basic Ethical Principles in European Bioethics and Biolaw Vol. I–II) together with a series of Working Papers as a first step towards stimulating and supporting a wide democratic debate about the most controversial questions in bioethics and biolaw. The first volume is co-authored by Jacob Dahl Rendtorff and Peter Kemp, but it was extensively discussed by the partners who participated at the final meeting in Barcelona in November 1998. The second volume contains particular papers by the partners relating to the project.

This short discussion document with policy proposals is aimed at a number of audiences, at decision-makers in the European Union at all levels, at educators at every level, researchers and practitioners, but most importantly at citizens generally within Europe (not just within the European Union). Its aim is to stimulate and assist a broader controversial public debate on some of the most vital and conflictual questions of our times. These questions have to be discussed not only in relation to the local European environment but in a globally sensitive way. The questions are not simply about the welfare of humans but also about social equity, the welfare of animals and the sustainability of the global environment.

In this document, you will find some remarks about the context within which the partners believe that the issues should be debated, four principles that the partners think are helpful guiding ideas in carrying forward the contemporary debate, and an agenda revealing some of the leading questions and some proposed pathway responses.

Indeed, the partners offer this document as experts but also in the spirit of responsible citizenship. In particular, it would be unethical for the partners to impose their specific proposals suggested below. Thus, it is the partners' explicit intention, and the purpose of this document, to facilitate critical democratic debate and responsive and accountable decision-making.

## *B. Context*

For the purposes of discussion of policy proposals, the partners worked with the idea that the value of "autonomy" (networked with integrity, dignity, and vulnerability) should be placed in the context of care for others – a context that already presupposes an ethic of solidarity, responsibility and justice (fairness). However, it is important that the idea of "autonomy in the context of care for others" itself should be placed in the broader context of biomedicine and biotechnology, economy, and culture in Europe in the late decades of the twentieth century.

First, the accelerated development of biomedicine and biotechnology – particularly in the area of genetics – has created (and is creating) many new possibilities but also it is posing many questions about the place of humans, animals, plants, and the environment (both natural and social). These are questions that the partners believe need to be debated as widely as possible and as a matter of urgency, but without the need being felt to arrive at hasty conclusions. However, there are considerable difficulties in articulating the terms in which such issues are to be framed and discussed, let alone resolved. The proposals below identify four key terms of reference for such a debate (namely the four principles of autonomy, dignity, integrity, and vulnerability) as well as outlining some policy suggestions indicated by these regulative basic concepts in a normative context.

Secondly, the proposals should be read as a contribution to a process of dialogue and debate about bioethical and biolegal policy in Europe. To a considerable extent, policy in Europe already reflects a culture of care for others – witness, for example, which was finalised while this project was underway. There is also considerable support in Europe for the principle of non-discrimination and the long-term sustainability of the environment. However, there can be little doubt that Europeans share the sense, first, of a responsibility for, and a responsivity to, others (the sense that others really do matter), and secondly a responsibility for ecological viability. Nevertheless, we are still marking out the conceptual terrain on which we can meet to express our agreement but also our disagreement. The four principles of

autonomy, dignity, integrity, and vulnerability, are, we think, important features of that terrain. It is not claimed, though, that these principles represent the whole of that terrain, nor indeed the only way of expressing an ethic of care for others and the quality of the global environment. The way they have been articulated is driven by the wish to achieve an open consensus. While the group agreed that the four guiding ideas are central to the analysis of bioethics and biolaw there was a considerable disagreement about a substantive interpretation of the guiding ideas and in particular the notion of dignity, while there were total agreement on the importance of articulating the notion of vulnerability. It should also be made clear that any application of the four guiding ideas will depend heavily on the particular interpretation of the principles.

Thirdly, the proposals offer a conceptual framework within which Europeans can debate issues of bioethics and biolaw. It should not be thought, however, that a common language implies an easy resolution of the matters to be discussed. Facilitating debate is one thing; resolving value differences is another matter altogether. Each of the four regulative principles presented in the next section should be regarded as guiding ideas for debate and decision-making. However, these principles are open to competing interpretations; the precise relationship between each of the principles will be informed by more general theoretical positions taken by disputants; and which life forms are to be included within the idea of the "other" (whether as a rights bearer or as one with interests to be protected and promoted) is contestable, as is the relationship between humans and the natural environment.

Fourthly, the framework is offered at one level for use within the European Union, as an economic community within the global market. Within this market, it must be understood, that biotechnology and biomedicine represent highly competitive global business. The market involves a process of exclusion which operates at a number of levels. At one level, citizens have difficulty in intervening in decision-making in this market. This document seeks to compensate for this democratic deficit. At another level, this post-national market operates to exclude the underprivileged throughout the world, North as well as South. Although this document has been drafted by Europeans for debate amongst Europeans, as we have emphasised, biotechnology is a global business. Whereas the significance of it being a global business is that the ethic of care for others knows no regional boundary, the significance of it being a global 'push' business is that ethics must address the commercial investment and imperatives driving modern biotechnology. That is to say, agreed positions within European bioethical debate will not be defensible if they neglect the interests of non-Europeans. Nor will they be effectively promoted if they fail to engage with commercial practice.

Finally, it is worth drawing out a crucial sense in which we (even the autonomous) are all vulnerable. The ethic of care for others is not simply a matter of protecting those who are incapable of acting autonomously (the most vulnerable forms of life). Rather, it is an ethic that builds on the premise that we are all capable of being wounded by the uncaring (and sometimes paternalistic) actions of others.

Despite recognition of complexities, in applying the four guiding ideas in context, the group was nonetheless able to tentatively agree on the following prescriptions, at least in principle.

## *C. Articulations*

- 1. Autonomy should not only be interpreted in the liberal sense of "Permission" given for treatment and/or experimentation. Five qualities should be considered: 1) the capacity of creation of ideas and goals for life, 2) the capacity of moral insight, "selflegislation" and privacy, 3) the capacity of reflexion and action without coercion, 4) the capacity of personal responsibility and political involvement, 5) the capacity of informed consent. But autonomy cannot express the full meaning of respect for and protection of the human being. Autonomy remains merely an ideal, because of the structural limitations given to it by human finitude and dependence on biological, material and social conditions, lack of information for reasoning etc. We must recognise the human person as a situated living body. Autonomy in relation to small children, persons in coma and persons that are mentally ill should remain an open question.
- 2. Dignity is the property by virtue of which beings possess moral status. There are several contested conceptions of dignity in European culture. Dignity is, variously, identified with the capacity for autonomous action, the capacity for experiencing pain or pleasure, being human (in the biological sense) or being a living organism or even system. Acknowledging various definitions our view is that it is nonetheless possible to argue successfully that human being have duties towards the nonhuman part of living nature.
- 3. Integrity. The idea of integrity expresses the untouchable core, the basic condition of dignified life, both physical and mental, that must not be subject to external intervention. Therefore, respect for integrity is respect for privacy and in particular for the patient's understanding of his or her own life and illness. Integrity refers to the coherence of life of beings with dignity that should not be touched and destroyed. In relation to human beings it is coherence of life which is remembered from experiences and therefore can be told in a narrative. It is the lifestory of a person, the narrative unity or history of human

society and culture. Some would also include the natural grown coherence in the life of animals and plants and finally the created wholeness of the world which makes the conditions for all life.

- 4. Vulnerability expresses two basic ideas. (a) It expresses the finitude and fragility of life which, in those capable of autonomy, grounds the possibility and necessity for all morality. (b) Vulnerability is the object of a moral principle requiring care for the vulnerable. The vulnerable are those whose autonomy or dignity or integrity are capable of being threatened. As such all beings who have dignity are protected by this principle. But the principle also specifically requires not merely non interference with the autonomy, dignity or integrity of beings, but also that they receive assistance to enable them to realise their potential. From this premiss it follows that there are positive rights to integrity and autonomy which grounds the ideas of solidarity, non-discrimination and community.
## *D. Applications*

- 5. The four guiding ideas or principles do not abolish cultural variations in Europe as long as they comply with the principle of subsidiarity.
- 6. The application of guiding ideas should not be restricted to the human sphere; dignity, integrity and vulnerability might also be considered as a basis for legislation and legal practice in relation to animals, plants and the environment.
- 7. Each country should have a national health service based on the principle of social insurance.
- 8. A Patients' Charter, specifying patient rights and a role for patients in health care policy decisions, should be enshrined in the legislation of all European countries.
- 9. Patients have the right to consent and refuse treatment and experimentation.
- 10. Lay persons should sit on research ethics committees.
- 11. Children born as a result of gamete donation have a right to information about their genetic parents, but donors should have no responsibilities or duties to such children.
- 12. Embryos should be accorded a proportional moral status according to their degree of development.
- 13. There should be protection of animals and the biosphere in legislation.
- 14. Anonymity of organ donors should be further discussed.
- 15. Euthanasia and other end of life decisions should be the subject of extensive debate and public consultation.
- 16. The commercialisation of human tissue, including the human genome and organ donation should be the subject of extensive debate and public consultation.
