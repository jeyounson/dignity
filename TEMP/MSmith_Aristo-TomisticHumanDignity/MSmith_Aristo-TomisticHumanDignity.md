### FOREWORD

Can one defend both the dignity of the human person and the primacy of the common good? Do they not appear, at first glance, to be mutually exclusive? And if they are not opposed one to the other, how are they related exactly? That difficult question is again at the center of present concerns, as it was in the recent past when such totalitarian regimes as Fascism and Stalinism divided Europe. The contribution of this study to a much desired solution to it and to related problems is quite remarkable. Not the least of its merits are the precision and economy of language it brings to the task - providing admirable proof that depth and clarity are not incompatible.

As is well known, there has been no lack of controversy, sometimes acute, on this issue in this century, especially amongst so-called traditional philosophers. Not only does Michael Smith bring out the main philosophical points of all parties in the dispute but he is able to show what progress in understanding we owe to these controversies. A great deal hangs on what is meant by a human person: "the ways in which we understand ourselves as persons has a direct bearing on the ways in which we organize ourselves collectively in political communities."

The dignity of the human person is at stake whenever fundamental human rights are threatened, and it is at the core of many present disputes in bioethics. Is the distinction between individual and person, of which much was made once,

a valid distinction? What is it that constitutes a human person? Could it be its spiritual soul alone, which would be for God, whereas our bodies, the material within us, would be for society and the State, and this would be the individual? As the author shows, on such a view a person qua person is spiritual only and we are therefore only partly persons. Any crudely dualistic view entails that the human body would enjoy no special dignity, taking on, in fact, the guise of an encumbrance to the soul -- as if the soul were to be better without it.

In other words, the solutions sought will derive no benefit from dualism. The author is quick to prove this in his first chapter. He goes on to explain that 'person' must refer "to the whole human being, in whom spirit is embodied", and that it cannot be parcelled out. The entire human being, body and soul, is a person. As he says, "It is not the rational nature alone, understood separately from the body, which gives a person his or her dignity; it is, rather, the fact that the whole person has a rational nature, and that the other faculties are ordered to that nature." Since rationality involves the ability to act by oneself, our dignity does consist in the ability to act intelligently and freely. Does this mean that the dignity of a particular person vanishes when the actual exercise of these higher functions is impeded because of severe· brain damage, say, or a grave mental handicap? In no way, answers the author: "Our perfection consists in our existence, and this perfection remains intact even when the actualization of certain capacities is impeded." In a word, then, a human person is one and indivisible, though not in the same sense as pure spirits: "Our perfection lies in the composition of body and soul, while the perfection of pure spirits lies in their simplicity. This composition is one of substantial (and not merely accidental) unity .... " One of the chief imports of the first sixty pages or so of this dissertation will have been to underscore the full meaning and the various implications of that unity. _

The second part of the dissertation, bearing more specifically on the common good, is no less commendable for its lucid treatment of a topic which many have found hard to understand. Going back, at the outset, to Aristotle, it reminds us that, in his view, politics is based on ethics and that although the good is worth })eing pursued even for only one man, the common good·· is better and "more divine" ( theioteron). The expression 'common advantage' (sumpheron koinon ), favoured by Aristotle, brings home the fact that the good in question is not the Good in itself, nor the Idea of the Good, but the good of someone or something. "In using the expression 'common advantage', Aristotle is spelling out the character of the good specific to the city: it is the good of all citizens." A privileged example of that common advantage is justice. It is the good specific to the political realm which serves to distinguish a just political regime from a corrupt one, and helps to explain why a government must be as inclusive and participatory as possible.

·The expression 'common good' has, however, several meanings. Further me<;t-nings of the expression are found in the works of Thomas Aquinas, taking us into theology. The communal aspect of our lives is extended, in Aquinas, to include the communion of all people under God. The dissertation spells out the difference between Aristotle's analysis of common advantage and Thomas Aquinas's analysis of the common good, while retaining their many agreements, particularly as regards the political sphere. The author firmly states in conclusion that the political common good and the good of each citizen cannot be reconciled if the common good is abstract. "A thing does not deserve to be called a common good unless it is also *my* good, and the good of each and every one of my fellow citizens."

This offers an e:x,cellent transition for the next part, in which the author gives a point by point account of the famous controversy which opposed I. Th. Eschmann (purporting to defend jacques Maritain) and Charles De Koninck. There has been so much confusion over that dispute, regarding both content and the persons concerned, that such a level-headed, well-informed summary as is found here would alone justify the publication of this outstanding study. All parties in the controversy sought to defend human dignity -- while each asking what exalts human dignity most of all. Both jacques Maritain and Charles De Koninck were, moreover, alive to the distinction to be made between the State as an administrative apparatus designed to serve the community, and the political community as composed of persons. A State may indeed go so far as to set itself against the good of the whole community and to become a super-individual.

But the person belongs to· communities other than the political, "and also to God as the highest common good." Hence, for De Koninck, the direct link between the primacy of the common good and the· promotion of human dignity. Rather than our dignity of nature, it is thus, in his view, our share in the common good which constitutes the greater part of our dignity. "A central point of De Koninck's thesis is that our dignity does not exist without our being linked to other people and especially to God." As Ralph Mcinerny put it, "that dignity will consist in man's ordination to a good which so far surpasses his capacity that he cannot be ordered to it except as to a common good." So disproportionate is that good that it "must necessarily be loved as a good in which many can participate." There are many kinds of proper goods, some of which we can share with others. The common good is never an alien good, as if it were the good of others and not of myself. In effect, it is my most desirable good.

These are the views which provoked Eschmann's attack against De Koninck. Michael Smith goes into a careful explanation of the points that were clarified by De Koninck in his reply to Eschmann, and shows that whereas Maritain's emphasis- was on the dignity of our nature, De Koninck's emphasis was on the dignity of our finality. "There is need for both explanations." Their views are "not only complementary,

but are indispensable to each other." This is because the relationship between the dignity of the human person and the common good is the relationship between our dignity of nature and our dignity of finality. This illuminating distinction is brought out extremely well, and repeatedly, in the dissertation.

v

Another way to elucidate the matter is to reflect on civic friendship, as the author does in another chapter. Friendship, in the broad sense of the term, makes a person part of a larger whole-- uniting husband and wife, or families, or other groups in society, or political communities themselves. It is obvious that, in the absence of anything common to share, genuine friendship is never possible; the same applies, then, to a political community if it is to be genuine. Civic friendship is therefore essential for a political community to hold together. The fact is that the quality of a friendship depends on the quality of the good shared among friends, and "fellow citizens are no exception." Like other forms of friendship it presupposes some form of equality and consists in the actual sharing of the goods of that community. Hence it is that a comparison can be made between the true forms and the corruptions of political communities, from monarchy to democracy, in the light of friendship as well as of justice. Civic friendship presents remarkable criteria to assess the quality of a political community.

In the light of those distinctions and considerations, a reinterpretation of individual and collective rights, as they have come to be called, becomes possible, providing further proof, if need be, of the value of those distinctions. This is what the final chapter manages to do, with no less felicity. But even a mere sketch of the reinterpretation proposed by Michael Smith would take us too far. Great riches are in store here again, as indeed in the whole of this very fine dissertation, for everyone who will read it.

## INTRODUCTION

In Catholic social teaching, there are two themes which serve as foundational pillars for social thought and action. One theme is the dignity of the human person. Every human person is of great worth. Every human person, by virtue of his or her nature, is endowed with inalienable rights -- rights which exist even when positive law refuses to recognize them.

The other central theme is the common good. Human society does not exist only for the sake of the private interests of its members. Nor does it exist for the sake of a kind of aggregate or sum total of these private interests. There is a good which is an end, a purpose which perfects a society. This good is that of the whole society, as well as the good of each member of society. It consists of an ethical life lived in common, a life characterized by justice and friendship. Where this common good is absent, there is, not political society, but rather a totalitarian State apparatus, or else anarchy.

These, then, are the two fundamental principles. But how are they related to each other? Is there not a contrariety between the dignity of the person and the common good? Does the person not have to conquer the recognition of his or her dignity over against the common good? In this dissertation, I intend to show that the dignity of each person is completed and perfected by the common good. It is impossible, in fact, to pursue the common good without recognizing the rights of persons and communities in positive law. And, without a society characterized by justice and friendship, the recognition

of rights is not sufficient to enable people to live well. It is this

relationship between human dignity and the common good which is the principal area of interest in this dissertation, and which constitutes its originality.

A word about methodology. The main presupposition of this dissertation is that there is a direct link between philosophical anthropology and political philosophy. The ways in which we understand ourselves as persons have a direct bearing on the ways in which we organize ourselves collectively in political communities. Conversely, the ways in which various peoples organize themselves presuppose particular ways of understanding the human person. A complete or integral humanism, to use jacques Maritain's exi>ression, can contribute to a society in which, however imperfectly, every aspect of a person's dignity and vocation is valued and fostered. ·sut a truncated or slanted view of a human person leads to a society in which one or more facets of a person's life are undervalued and oppressed. This linkage between philosophical anthropology and political philosophy is the starting-point of the dissertation.

The second methodological point is that although the subject-matter of the dissertation is of Christian and specifically Catholic inspiration, this is nonetheless a philosophical treatise. I am exploring, not Catholic social teaching itself, but some philosophical issues which are presupposed by that teaching. Readers, therefore, will be disappointed if they are expecting a comprehensive expose of the Christian vision of human persons and communities. Like any philosophical work, this dissertation confines itself to truths knowable by natural reason as distinct from supernatural faith. Those truths knowable only with the aid of Divine Revelation are beyond the scope of philosophy.

And yet, readers who expect a secularistic view of human persons and communities will also be disappointed. Faith, to be sure, does not replace reason, but it inevitably informs the reasoning process by prompting one to reason

about certain questions and areas of interest which themselves are properly philosophical. Thus, although this is a philosophical treatise, its interest for Catholicism will be obvious. My hope is that it will be understandable also to people of other faiths and of no faith.

This work is situated within a particular philosophical tradition. I shall draw heavily upon the works of Aristotle (384-322 B.C.) and St. Thomas Aquinas (1225?-1274). The principal twentieth-century authors to which I shall make reference are jacques Maritain (1882-1973) and Charles D; Koninck ( 1906-1965). While making every effort to be faithful to the text of each author's writings, I do not intend this work to be a treatise in the history of philosophy. Rather, in an effort to address a contemporary question, I shall draw upon some insights of each author, and shall leave others aside. I intend to take the discussion one step further in the final chapter, applying the resulting synthesis to human rights. The Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition, in short, offers a positive contribution to contemporary issues, provided that one build upon that tradition in fidelity to its spirit.

There are several reasons for which I believe this dissertation is a contribution to scholarship.

First, within the scholarly community in general, this dissertation will mark a contribution to a wide-ranging discussion on the common good. Writings on the common good have multiplied in the past five years or so, especially as a reflective response to the individualism of the 1980's. The dissertation presents the contribution which one particular religious and philosophical tradition can bring to this debate.

Secondly, within the Catholic community, the subjectmatter will be of interest in the fields of theology, philosophy, and Catholic social thought. In particular, the dissertation discusses a controversial debate which took place between Charles De Koninck and I. Th. Eschmann, O.P., in the 1940's. The debate sparked quite lively reactions at the time but, owing to its complexity and heated tone, it has not been

summarized and discussed at any length by subsequent scholars.

Thirdly, a contribution of the dissertation consists in the fact that it compares and contrasts the writings of Aristotle, St. Thomas Aquinas; jacques Maritain, and Charles De Koninck on the dignity of the person and the common good. These two topics are fundamental to Catholic social teaching, yet the relationship between these two themes has rarely been discussed to any great precision, much less synthesized. The dissertation has the advantage of bringing together the teachings of a philosophical tradition which has had profound influence on Catholic thought.

### PART ONE

# THE DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN PERSON

# CHAPTER ONE PERSON AS WHOLE: JACQUES MARIT AIN

We affirm in vain the dignity and the vocation of the human person if we do not work to transform the conditions which oppress him or her, and if we do not work to make it possible for that person to eat his or her bread in dignity.

jacques Maritain

I

One of the principal notions in jacques Maritain's philosophy of the human person is that the person is a whole. But what does he mean? Why is it so important? In order to under~tand what Maritain has in mind, and to understand its import for his philosophical project, it is necessary to trace back to Aristotle the precise meanings of words which are used extensively in the analysis of human persons. 'Part' and 'whole' figure prominently in this analysis, and since a thing is a whole to the extent that it is one, Aristotle's analysis of the one is also relevant to the discussion. Maritain traces the origins of his philosophical system to Thomas Aquinas and, through Aquinas, to Aristotle, hence the pertinence of these portions of Aristotle's philos6phicallexicon. Thomas' commentary on these particular passages will also be of help. Taken together, these two authors serve as the context within which Maritain's analysis of person and society can be understood.

My purpose in the following section is not to detail all the meanings of these words, but only to identify those particular meanings which shed light on the nature of the person.

- I I
TheOne

In Metaphysics V, 6, Aristotle writes that the one is that which is one by accident, and also that which is one by itself (kath'auto) (1015b17). Things which are one by themselves are so called either because they are continuous or because their substratum (substance) or genus does not differ in kind, or again because their definitions are the same. A human person is certainly continuous, but that is not the sense in which a person is most one:

> (T)he things that are primarily called one are those whose substance is one -- and one either in continuity or in form or in definition; for we count as more than one either things that are not continuous, or those whose form is not one, or those whose definition is not one (1016b8-10)l

The point here is that the trait which, more than any other, characterizes the one is iJ:ldivisibility. And a substance is above all things indivisible. When one observes that there are different kinds (genera) of things in the world, it becomes apparent that some genera can be divided into lower genera. For example, plane figures can be divided into triangles, quadrilaterals, etc. The lowest genera, in turn, can be subdivided by their differences into species. Within species, however, substances are the lowest level of divisibility. They

<sup>1</sup> Unless otherwise indicated, translations of Aristotle are taken from The Basic Works of Aristotle, (Richard McKeon, ed.), New York: Random House, 1941.

cannot be divided without undergoing a substantial change, without becoming another thing. It is in this sense that they are most one.

For a thing to be most properly one, it is not enough for it to be continuous. It must also form a whole; that is to say, it must be one not only in matter but also in form or species. Aquinas spells out the connection between oneness and wholeness in the following way:

> [Aristotle] says that whenever some things are said to be one on account of continuity alone, they are not [said to be one] unless there is some whole and complete thing. That indeed is the case when it has some one species, not indeed just as a homogeneous subject is said to be one in species ... , but to the extent that the species holds together in some totality requiring a determinate ordering of [its] parts. just as it is clear that we do not say "one something" -- to take the example of an artifact -~ when we see the parts of a shoe put together in any way whatsoever (unless perhaps to the exten't that the one is taken as a continuum), so we say that all the parts of a shoe are one when they are put together in such a way that there is a shoe, and that it has some one species; that is, [the species] of shoe.l ·

Ist. Thomas Aquinas, *In duodecim libros Metaphysicorum Aristotelis expositio.* (Cathala et Spiazzi, eds. Taurini: Marietti, 1950), V, 7, 870. "(D)icit, quod quandoque aliqua dicuntur unum propter solam continuitatem, quandoque vero non, nisi sit aliquod totum et perfectum; quod quidem contingit quando habet aliquam unam speciem, non quidem sicut subiectum homogeneum dicitur unum specie ... , sed secundum quod species in quadam totalitate consistit requirens determinatum ordinem partium; sicut patet quod non dicimus unum aliquid, ut artificiatum, quando videmus partes calceamenti qualitercumque compositas, nisi forte secundum quod accipitur unum pro continuo; sed tunc dicimus esse unum omnes partes calceamenti, quando sic sunt compositae, quod sit calceamentum et habeat aliquam unam speciem, scilicet calceamenti." [Unless otherwise indicated, ail translations from Latin and French are those of the author.]

A thing is most one when it is a whole. And a whole has to do not only with the presence of all the partsl of a thing, but also with the way in which the parts are ordered. It is by virtue of the ordering of the parts of a thing that a particular subject is recognizable as belonging to a species.

Aristotle notes (1016b31) that things can be one in different ways: in number, in genus, in species, or by analogy. A human person is one in number, but among themselves human persons are one in species. With all other animals, they are one with respect to the remote genus living thing. This fact must be kept in mind as a counterbalance to the uniqueness of each person. Each person is one, but each has characteristics in common with other persons, with other animals, and with other living things. In a note on 1016a27-31, jules Tricot explains Aristotle's statement that things are said to be one according to a higher genus, but not one according to their proximate genus:

> Beings falling under the same genus are one; but if this proximate genus itself is in a higher genus (the genus triangle, in the genus figure), its species [pl.] (last or not: for example, the isosceles triangle and the equilateral triangle) will be one with respect to this higher genus and not with respect to their proximate genus. In other words, isosceles triangle and equilateral triangle differ from each other in relation to their proximate genus (triangle), but are one in relation to their remote genus (figure). Ross (Eng. tr. ad hoc) gives a very clear explanation of Aristotle's thought: Horse, man and dog are one, because all are animals. But if we are to call

<sup>1</sup> It is not always the case that all the parts must be present for there to be a whole. In generation, a whole is already present in act, while at least some of its parts are in potency. The human fetus, for example, is a person in act (presuming that animation has taken place), even though at least some of its parts are in potency (i.e., are not yet developed). The same principle is at work in the case of a handicapped person. A handicap is the result of the frustration of a particular potency's being actualized.

At corruption (after death), there is not a whole even though all the parts (i.e., according to the quantitative sense of a part) may still be present. (cf. Metaph., N, 11, 1019a12-14)

them one something, we cannot call them 1 one (kind of) animal, but must to the higher genus [sic] and call them one (kind of) living thing. [Italics are those ofTricot.]2

Human persons are one with other animals in relation to the genus living thing, but we differ from other animals in relation to the genus animal. When one takes into consideration the fact that the genus living thing is divided into the lower genera plant and animal, human persons are one with dogs and horses in the sense that they are animals as opposed to plants. But within the genus animal, we are a distinct species and in this sense are not one with the other animals.

Aquinas' commentary notes that the analysis of the one is situated within the context of that which, taken altogether (communiter) is the subject of metaphysics. The analysis of a being (ens) is also part of the entire subject of metaphysics, as opposed to a substance, which is the principal intention of metaphysics. 3

Aquinas makes some clarifications on the issue of the one according to a form within a species. He writes that some things can be continuous in the same subject while still being of different species, as for instance gold can be contained in silver. These are one in quantity alone, but not according to the nature of the subject. "But if the whole continuous subject is of one form according to a species, it will be one both according to the explanation of a quantified thing and

lActually, it would be more correct to write, "One cannot truthfully call them one . . . . "

<sup>2</sup>Aristotle, La Metaphysique, tome I, commentaire par *].* Tricot. (Paris: Vrin, 1981), p. 264. "Les etres tombant sous un meme genre sont un; mais si ce genre prochain rentre lui-meme dans un genre plus eleve (le genre triangle, dans le genre figure), ses especes (dernieres ou non: par exemple, le triangle isocele et le triangle equilateral) seront une par rapport a ce genre plus eleve et non par rapport a leur genre prochain. En d'autres termes, triangle isocele et triangle equilateral different l'un de l'autre par rapport a leur genre prochain (triangle), mais sont un par rapport a leur genre eloigne (figure). Ross (tract. ang. ad hoc) donne une explication tres claire de la pensee d'Ar.: [The quotation from Ross is in English in the text.]

<sup>3</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, *op. cit.,* V, 7, 842.

according to the explanation of a nature." I The one defined according to continuity denotes a quantitative oneness, whereas oneness according to form within a species is qualitative.

Concerning oneness according to genus, Aquinas notes that this latter kind of oneness is different from the preceding one in that while oneness of form (or numerical oneness) has a subject undistinguished by forms, oneness according to genus has as its subject a genus which is divided by its specific differences.2 Here, Aquinas relates genus and difference to matter and form respectively. Although the one in genus is not the same thing as the one in matter, still the genus is taken from that which is material in things, while the specific difference is taken from the form of things. Aquinas spells out the application of this principle to the human person:

> For a rational soul is not the difference of man, since it is not predicated of a man. Rather, [the difference of man is] "having-a-rational-soul", which is what the word 'rational' signifies. And similarly sensory nature is not the genus of man, but a part. Also, "having-a-sensorynature", which is signified by the word 'animal', is the genus of man. And similarly, therefore, there is a close measure3 by which some things are one in matter and one in genus. 4

lJbid., V, 7, 859. "Si vero totum subiectum continuum sit unius formae secundum speciem, erit unum et secundum rationem quantitatis et secundum rationem naturae."

<sup>2</sup>Jbid. v, 7, 861.

<sup>3</sup>The literal meaning of 'modus' is "size". (Cf. John R. Gallup, The Original Meaning of the Latin Word Modus (doctoral dissertation. Quebec: Faculty of Philosophy, Laval University, 1963.) Oneness in matter and oneness in genus are literally of similar "size".

<sup>4</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, *op. cit.,* V, 7, 862. "Non enim anima rationalis est differentia hominis, cum de homine non predicetur; sed habens animam rationalem, quod significat hoc nomen rationale. Et similiter natura sensitiva non est genus hominis, sed pars. Habens etiam naturam sensitivam, quod nomine animalis significatur, est hominis genus. Simiiiter ergo et propinquus modus est quo aliqua sunt unum materia et unum genere."

A rational soul is part of a human being. We are not souls; we have souls. It should be noted that for Aristotle and Aquinas alike, all animals and plants have souls, but souls of different kinds. A sensory nature, as well, is a part of a human being. We are a composite of both, and it is the fact that both are taken together which makes a human being one. Having a rational soul (literally, having a soul with logos) is our specific difference; it is this logos, this ability to "count", to explain, to engage in discourse, which sets us apart from the other animals, We are not set apart merely by the fact that we have a soul, because any living thing has by definition a soul-- soul being the principle of life. Also, having a sensory nature -- and not the sensory nature itself -- is what we have in common with the other animals. Each of us has his or her own sensory nature, as indeed each of us has his or her own rational soul, and thus it is not this Sensory nature itself which we have in common with the animals; rather, we share the essential property of having such a nature.

Aquinas sheds further light on how it is that things of different species within the same genus are one in relation to the remote genus but not in relation to the proximate genus. Using the example of the equilateral and isosceles triangles, he writes that these two triangles do not differ from each other by the (sJ)ecific) differences into which the genus figure is divided. Rather, they differ by way of the differences into which the genus triangle is divided.! Similarly, we human beings differ from other animals according to the differences into which the genus animal is divided, but we do not differ according to the differences into which the genus living thing is divided.

lJbid., V, 7, 863. He adds, "Idem autem dicitur a quo aliquid non differt differentia." ("But the same is said of that from whch something does not differ [by way of specific] difference.") Two things of the same species are said to be one in relation to the proximate genus and not to the species. Two human beings, for example, are the same kind of animal, but ·they are not the same kind of human being. There are accidental, not specific, differences among human beings.

This analysis of the one has brought to light a number of points which are relevant to any treatment of the nature of a human person. A human person is one by him- or herself *(kath'auto, per* se) not only because the various parts of the person are continuous but also because each person is one substance, and one in form. There can be no divisibility without the person's becoming another kind of thing. For example, a dead body is not merely a living body which has undergone an accidental change; a dead body is not the same kind of thing as a living body. The separation of body and soul causes the body to become a different kind of thing, to undergo a substantial change. Similafly, a disembodied human soul is not the same thing as a person, but only a part of the person.

A thing can be one either numerically, specifically, generically, or by analogy. A human person, taken by him- or herself, is numerically ·one. With each other, human persons are specifically one. And with other animals, persons are one in relation to the genus living thing.

Taken by themselves, human persons are most one in the sense that they are a whole. They are composed of parts, and the parts are ordered to one another in a particular way. This fact pertains not only to the various parts of the body but also -- and especially -- to the union of body and soul as matter and substantial form. The union is such that 'person', as far as human beings are concerned, refers always and only to a body-soul composite.

#### *A Part*

The third kind of part which Aristotle describes is important to the discussion of a human person. What is called a part is that into which a whole is divided, or of that which constitutes a whole, 'whole' meaning either the form or that which has a form (1023b18-23). Here, Aristotle is referring not merely .to a division of a whole inasmuch as a whole is a quantified thing, as in the first sense ofa part. If the division

into parts were quantitative only, a part would be only a material part of a thing, such as a part of an animal's body. This third meaning is a recognition of the fact that a material cause is not what makes something to be a particular kind of thing. Matter is not indeterminate; it takes on various forms depending on the kinds of things of which it is a component. Now a soul is the substantial form of a living thing, and a rational soul is the substantial form of a human person. Thus, although a soul cannot be identified with any of the parts of the human body, and therefore does not fall under the first meaning of a part, it is nonetheless a part of a person in that body and soul (matter and form) together make a whole. Similarly, the sum of the material or quantified parts of a person (i.e., the human body in its entirety) is not the whole person. In a word, it is a mistake to identify a human person with one or more parts of that person.

Aquinas, when commenting on this third meaning of a part, uses the word 'species' instead of 'forma') Flesh and blood are not part of a species, but are part of "that which has a species" (i.e., the person as an individual being). The rational soul is part of the person as member of a species, of the person as one particular kind of thing.

#### A Whole

As we have already seen2, a thing is one (in one sense) if it forms a whole.

The primary meaning of a whole pertains most aptly to a human person (1023b26-28). A whole is that which does not lack any of the parts which are said to constitute naturally a whole. Jules Tricot notes3 that the main point of this first meaning is that a whole is a natural being. This point distinguishes the first meaning from the second, which posits

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* V, 21, 1095.

Zsee above, in the section entitled 'The One'.

<sup>3].</sup> Tricot, op. cit., p. 312 (note).

that a whole is that which contains the things contained, such that they form a unit. The genus living thing is a whole in that it is predicated of a man, a horse, and a dog. An individual natural being, however, is more properly a whole because its parts form an integral unit.

It is worthwhile to ask the question whether the second meaning of a whole pertains to human beings, not individually, but in society. The first part of the second meaning is as follows:

> 'A whole' means ... (2) that which so contains the things it contains that they form a unity ... as being each severally one single thing ... For (a) that which is true of a whole class and is said to hold good as a whole (which implies that it is a kind of whole) is true of a whole in the sense that it contains many things by being predicated of each, and by all of them, e.g. man, horse, god, being severally one single thing, because all are living things. (1023b26-32)

Neither 'society' nor 'political community' nor 'State' are predicated of its members taken individually. None of us can truthfully say, "L'Etat, c'est *moi".* A political community is not a species of which its members are individuated instances. We do, however, attribute membership in the *polis* to individuals by paronymy ('Canadian', but not 'Canada', is said of the individual). A political community is in no sense a substance; it is an accident (a relation, to be exact) which exists in and among human persons. Human persons form or constitute a political community; the community does not constitute them. 'Canadian' expresses a relation to a political community. The genus to which the individual belongs, in this case, is not Canada but Canadians. If the political community can be called a whole of which its members each form a part, it is by analogy. A person is to the *polis* as, say, an organ is to the

body, but the political community is not literally a body any more than the person is literally an organ. I

Those quantified things having a beginning, a middle, and an end, the position of whose parts makes a difference, are also called wholes. ( 1 024a1-3) The relevance of this meaning to the human person has already been discussed under the heading The One.

# III

Let us now turn to the major works of jacques Maritain dealing with the human person as whole. My approach in this section will be to take in chronological order the works of Maritain dealing with political philosophy, discussing those passages which refer to this theme.

#### Du Regime tempore] et de la liberte ( 1933)

The earliest mention of the person as whole is to be found in Du Regime tempore] et de la liberte, which serves as a seminal work for Humanisme integral, published three years afterward. Maritain introduces the theme of person as whole in the context of a discussion on human liberty. The main idea is that the liberty which is commonly called free choice is a consequence of the metaphysical structure of a human person. But there is yet another type of liberty, one which must be realized in the life of a person:

> But the notion of liberty is much more vast than [free choice]; free choice is the very root of the world of liberty. It is a metaphysical given. We receive it with our rational nature. We do not have to conquer it. It

<sup>1</sup> This example is cited by Thomas Gilby, O.P, in his notes on the Summa theologiae Ia Ilae, qq. 90-97. See Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologiae, [Blackfriars Edition, vol. 28] (London: Blackfriars, 1966), p. 172. Gilby notes that a -person relates as part to whole in subordinate groupings such as families, tribes, and economic partnerships.

appears as *initial* liberty. But this metaphysical root must bear fruit in the psychological and moral order. We are asked to become in our action what we are already metaphysically: a person. By our own effort, we must make ourselves persons, masters of ourselves, and a whole unto ourselves. There is thus another liberty, a liberty which we must win dearly: *terminal* liberty.l

This terminal liberty is what Maritain calls autonomy, an autonomy which views a person as a responsible moral agent, and which also takes into account the prerogatives of God in the formation of one's conscience. There are a couple of things which are puzzling here. First, Maritain is ambiguous as to whether he is describing a concept or a reality. He begins by writing that the *notion* of liberty is more vast than free choice, but then he writes of the form which liberty takes in reality. Secondly, it is not clear how a person can be a whole and yet not be a whole. In what sense can I be a whole as a metaphysical given and yet not be a whole in terms of my actions? The first kind of liberty is fairly straightforward: our freedom of choice involves our ability to choose, or to fall to choose, the appropriate means of achieving our good. This ability, as Maritain writes, is a metaphysical given, a part of our rational nature. We could call it a potency, or a disposition to act in a certain way. *Terminal* liberty, in this framework, is the actualization of that potency. When one applies this same analysis to a person as a whole, it is not difficult to see that our being a whole, a unity of a rational soul and a body, is the root

<sup>1</sup> Jacques Maritain, *Du Regime tempore] et de Ja Jiberte,* (Paris: Desclee De Brouwer, 1933), p. 35. "Mais la notion de liberte est beaucoup plus vaste que cela; le libre arbitre est la racine meme du monde de la liberte; c'est une donnee metaphysique, nous le recevons avec notre nature raisonnable, nous n'avons pas ale conquerir; il apparait comme la liberte *initiale.* Mais cette racine metaphysique doit fructifier dans l'ordre psychologique et moral; il nous est demande de devenir dans notre agir ce que nous sommes deja metaphysiquement, une personne; nous devons nous rendre par notre propre effort une personne maitresse d'elle-meme et qui soit a elle-meme un tout. Voila done une autre liberte-, une liberte que nous devons cherement gagner: liberte *terminal e."* 

of this potency for moral, human actions. It is not so obvious how, by actualizing this potency, one becomes a whole in some other way. Maritain seems to be suggesting that there is more . than one way in which a human person is a whole: a whole in moral action as well as a whole in ontological structure. One possible meaning could be spelled out as follows: A being endowed with a rational soul is capable of moral, human, free action. To realize this capacity is to act in the moral realm according to what one already is in the metaphysical realm. We act according to what we (already) are. We do not become what we were not already.

A passage in the same work spells out what Maritain In.eans by 'person', and what he does not mean:

> The notion of person is an analogical notion, which is realized in different degrees and on essentially different ontological levels. The human being is a person; that is, a universe of a spiritual nature, endowed with freedom of choice and designated for freedom of autonomy. He or she is not any more a *pure person* than a *pure intelligence.* On the contrary, since he or she is at the lowest degree in the scale of intellectuality, he or she is also at the lowest degree of that of personality. To forget that would be to confuse the human person with the angelic person or the divine person ... .1

For Maritain, the notion of person comes from theology: it goes from the Divine Persons to angelic persons and finally to human persons. Maritain's approach is theological. For political philosophy, it is the human person who is immediately being considered. On Maritain's view, we are persons by virtue

lJbid., pp. SSf. "La notion de personne est une notion analogique, qui se realise a des degres divers et sur des plans ontologiques essentiellement differents. L'etre humain est une personne, c'est-adire un univers de nature spirituelle, doue de la liberte de choix et destine a la liberte d'autonomie: il n'est pas plus *pure personne* qu'il n'est *pure intelligence.* Au contraire, comme il est au plus bas degre dans l'echel~e de l'intellectualite, il est aussi au plus bas degre dans celle de la personnalite. Oublier cela serait confondre la personne humaine avec la personne angelique ou avec la personne divine .... "

of that part of us which is spiritual or intellectual. Maritain is careful to point out that this spiritual part of us is not the only part. This point raises a few questions. On the one hand, Maritain wants to maintain that a human person is a whole; on the other hand, that in us which is "person" is being described as a part. Would it not be more consistent to hold that a human being-- body and soul-- is a person? On such a view, it is the body-soul unity, and not ju~t the presence of a body, which makes a human person different from an angel or from God. For our soul, being ordered toward union with a body, is not the same kind of intellectual being as an angel or as God. All by itself, it is only part of a person. It is difficult, at least at this point, to see how Maritain's view that a person is a whole, can be reconciled with his view that our personhood is only part of us.

Another difficulty is of a terminological nature. Maritain uses the ambiguous expressions 'the notion of person' and 'the human person', which raise doubt as to whether he is talking about notions or real human persons. To say 'the human person' instead of 'a human person' gives the impression that what is being talked about is an abstract idea rather than a concrete reality. The expression 'the human person', in this context, could also mean 'all human persons'. If so, good, but this is not clear. I am mentioning this terminological difficulty at the outset, and will henceforth presume that Maritain is writing about all concrete human persons, unless the context seems to point to another interpretation.

#### Humanismeintegral (1936)

In this pivotal work in which Maritain formulates his vision of a new Christian humanism, Maritain draws out in more detail the philosophical anthropology previously introduced in Du Regime temporel et de la liberte . At the very outset of the first chapter, he distinguishes between the

Aristotelian view of man on the one hand, and what he calls the medieval view of man on the other hand. Noting that the Aristotelian view posits man as an animal endowed with reason, Maritain extrapolates that this makes man a spirit by virtue of the principal part of man. Man's being an animal endowed with reason entails that he must have superhuman (surhumaines) aspirations, but it also entails that because this spirit or mind (esprit) is that of an animal, it is the weakest of spirits and that, in fact, man lives more often in the senses than in the spirit.! To this view Maritain compares what he calls the medieval view, which depicts man as a person. Maritain repeats the definition of 'person' from Du Regime temporel , and then he makes some modifications. A person, once again, is a universe or world (univers) of a spiritual nature, endowed with freedom of choice, and nonetheless constituting an independent whole before the world (monde). This time, Maritain omits the reference to terminal liberty. Instead, he adds that neither nature nor the State can eat away at this universe which is a human person. God respects the freedom of a human person while dwelling within that person; he draws or attracts (sollicite) the person and never forces him or her. Maritain further adds that the human person is wounded, a reference to original sin.2 To be a person, according to Maritain, is to be a world within the larger world. According to Maritain's reading of the medieval view, the soul of a human being is something more than the soul as described by Aristotle. It is a spiritual being distinct (although not separate) from nature. Maritain does not say whether the "medieval view" is in fact the Augustinian view, but Maritain's language makes it sound as though he were describing the soul as a substance in its own right, rather than as the substantial form of a body-soul composite substance. That being said, it is

ljacques Maritain, *Humanisme integral: problemes temporels et spirituels d'ime nouvelle chretiente,* (Paris: Au bier, 1936), p. 17. 2 *Ibid.,* p. 18.

doubtful whether Maritaln would have wanted to make such a claim. 1

As for the relationship between a person and the political community, there are two passages in the Summa theologiae of Thomas Aquinas which Maritain identifies as encapsulating this relationship. The first passage is a corrective to an individualist view of society, a view which places an excessive emphasis on the individual at the expense of the political community as a whole. Aquinas writes, "Each singular person is compared to the whole community as a part to a whole" (ST lla Ilae, 64, 2).2 It is by analogy that a person

2"(Q)uaelibet persona singularis comparatur ad totam communitatem sicut pars ad totum." Quoted by Maritain in Humanisme integral, p. 147. Actually, this is part of an argument in favor of capital punishment in the Summa . "Evey ... part is ordered to the whole as the incomplete to the complete, and therefore every part is naturally for the sake of the whole. And so we have seen that if the amputation of some member is necessary for the health of the whole human body (because, say, it is rotten and corruptive of the others), it is praiseworthy and salutary to amputate it. But every singular person is compared to the whole community as part to whole. And therefore if some man is dangerous to the community and corruptive of it on account of some sin, it is praiseworthy and salutary to kill him, so that the common good will be preserved." (Omnis ... pars ordinatur ad totum ut imperfectum ad perfectum; et ideo omnis pars naturaliter est propter totum. Et propter hoc vidimus quod si saluti totius corporis humanis expediat praecisio alicujus membri, puta cum est putridum et corruptivum aliorum, laudabiliter _ et salubriter abscinditur. Quaelibet autem persona singularis comparatur ad totam communitatem sicut pars ad totum. Et ideo si aliquis homo sit periculosus communitati, et corruptivus ipsius

lin Scholasticism and Politics, Maritain is more explicit: "(T)he human soul constitutes, with the matter which it informs, a unique substance, both spiritual and fleshly. It is not as Descartes believed: the soul is not one thing -- thought -- existing as a complete being; and the body another thi11g - extension -- existing in its own way as a complete being. But soul and matter are two substantial co-principles of one and the same being, of a single and unique reality whose name is man. It is because each soul is made to animate a particular body (which derives its matter from the germinative cells from which it springs with all their load of heredity); it is because each soul has a substantial relation, or rather is a substantial relation with a particular body; it is for these reasons that it has in its very substance individual characteristics which differentiate it from every other human soul. For man, as for all other corporeal beings, -- as for the atom, the molecule, the plant, the animal, -- individuality has its primary ontological root in matter." (Scholasitcism and Politics, London: Geoffrey Bles, 1954 [originally published in 1940], pp. 48f.)

is said to be part of a whole. Thus, a person is to the political community *as* a part is to a whole. A person is already a whole, and also a substance with its own act of existence. The relationship to the whole community is part of the definition of a person, but it does not exhaust that definition. The example of parts of a body is helpful here. No bodily part has its own act of existence; each is defined exclusively in terms of its function vis-a-vis the entire body. A person is part of the whole community in a different way, however. The existence of each person is presumed before there is any mention of his or her being related to the community, and the function of a person within the community is derived from what it means to be a person. In the case of a body, however, the existence of the body is presumed before there is any mention of its parts, and the function of each part is derived from what it means to be a body. The point of Aquinas' statement is to affirm that a person's disposition to social or political life is part of that person's nature. This is a corrective to any individualist view which would hold that we are fundamentally pre-social beings who may or may not agree to form a community.

The second text of Aquinas which Maritain cites is a corrective to totalitarianism!: "Man is not ordered to the political community according to himself [as a] whole and

propter aliquid peccatum, laudabiliter et salubriter occiditur, ut bonum commune conservatur.)

It is one thing to argue that the political community has the right to execute some criminals under some circumstances; it is another thing to claim that those circumstances obtain here and now, and that there is no alternative course of action.

1 Maritain defines totalitarianism as "every conception in which the political community (either the State in the strict sense of the word, or the organized collectivity) claims for itself the whole and entire man: either to form him, or to be the end of all his activities, or to constitute the essence of his personhood and his dignity." *Ibid.,* p. 147, note 1. (" . . . toute conception dans laquelle la communaute politique, -- soit l'Etat au sens strict du mot, soit la collectivite organisee, -- revendique pour elle l'homme tout entier, ou bien pour le former, ou bien pour etre la fin de toutes ses activites, ou bien pour constituer !'essence de sa personnnalite et de sa dignite.") according to everything which is his" (ST Ia llae, 21, 4 ad 3).1 The first thing noticeable is the fact that in this passage Aquinas puts homo as the subject of the sentence, whereas the preceding passage has quaelibet paersona singularis as the subject. The word homo is ambiguous; it can mean either one man (the same as vir), or the species, or each member of the species. In this case, it is obvious that Aquinas is referring to each member of the species taken individually. What is striking is that in the first passage Aquinas explicitly states that each singular or particular person (persona singularis) is compared to the whole community as a part to a whole. The word 'person' is explicitly stated. When we put the two complementary passages together, the composite picture is that each particular person is indeed compared to the political community as part to whole, though not according to that person as a whole, nor·according to everything which belongs to that person.

Maritain gives a somewhat different explanation of the first passage. On Maritain's view, we are subordinate to the whole community precisely by virtue of that part of us which, he writes, is not "person". We are not pure (i.e., divine or angelic) persons, subsisting spiritually; we are also individuals, individuated fragments of a species.2 We are parts of the

l"(H)omo non ordinatur ad totam communitatem secundum se totum et secundum omnia sua". This quote is part of an article of which the subject of inquiry is "whether a human act inasmuch as it is good or bad has the nature of merit or demerit before God". The consequence of the statement quoted by Maritain is that "not every human act must be the object of reward or punishment by the political community." (" ... non oportet quod quilibet actus ejus [i.e., hominis] sit meritorius vel demeritorius per ordinem ad communitatem politicam.")

<sup>2</sup> Jacques Croteau, O.M.I., points out a distinction between the principle of individuation and individuality. The former is a cause of the latter. Matter, for composite substances, is the principle of individuation, but it does not follow that to be individual is to be material. To be individual, above all, means to be incommunicable: to be indistinct in oneself and distinct from others; It is a concrete substance whci is individual. When there is a composite, concrete sunstance, individuality is a characteristic not only of its matter but also of its form. In other words, an individual is a whole, not a part. In light of this, it would seem that Maritain has confused the principle of

whole community in that we are material. (Matter, we recall, is the principle of individuation.) And we transcend the community in that we are persons, or spiritual. This division of a human being into person and individual is somewhat confusing. For one thing, it is one and the same human being whom Maritain is calling both a person and an individual. If only the spiritual part of me is a person, then two consequences follow:

1. A person qua person is spiritual only.

2. We are only partly persons. I

And yet, Aquinas writes that the singular person is (analogically) a part of the whole community, while Maritain would have it that we are (analogically) part of the whole community inasmuch as we are, not persons, but (material) individuals. Rather than trying to opt for one or the other position, it would be better to stand back and examine the apparent dichotomy created by the person-individual distinction. The distinction does not place enough emphasis on our being a body-soul unity. To call only part of us "person" ·is to create an artificial division between our bodies and our minds. These two parts of ourselves are distinct, but at no time during life are they separate. If we are to be called persons, as we should, then 'person', to do justice to the unity of body and spirit, must refer to the whole human being, in whom spirit is embodied. Such an approach would avoid the apparent parcelling-out of a person, with language that sounds

individuation with individuality. See jacques Croteau, O.M.I., Les Fondements thomistes du personnalisme de Maritain, (Ottawa: Editions de l'Universite d'Ottawa, 1955), pp. 122-125.

1 In Scholasticism and Politics, published four years after Humanisme integral, Maritain clears up some of ;the ambiguous language in the distinction between person and individual. On Maritain's view, it is not the case that we are only partly persons; rather, we are persons by virtue of a part of us. "I am wholly an individual, by reason of what I receive from matter, and I am wholly a person, by reason of what I receive from spirit: just as a painting is in its entirety a physicochemical complex, by reason of the colouring materials out of which it is made, and a work of beauty, by reason of the painter's art." (op. cit., p. 52.)

too much as though our bodies belonged to the State and our souls to God. God has an ultimate, absolute claim on the whole person, bOdy and soul. The problem is to determine the limits of the proximate, relative claim which the political community has on each person. The political community has an autonomy which is rightfully its own; the problem is to specify the nature and the limits of that autonomy.

Maritain provides some clues as to how our spiritual and temporal vocations are joined. He writes that there is a state of tension proper to the temporal life of a human being. He refers to temporal life as a common task (oeuvre) to be accomplished by the social whole as such. All persons, as parts ("analogically" is always understood) of the whole, are subordinate to this common task. The fact that Maritain describes temporal life as a task, as something to make or build, helps us to refonilulate the problem. The question is not so much, "Which parts of a person make him or her a part of the whole community?", as, "Which tasks are done in common with others in the political community, and which are not? Which goods are common goods, and which are not?" To complete the picture, it is worth noting that one and the same human being belongs simultaneously to several communities, many of which overlap: a family, a clan, one or more citizens' groups, different levels of political communities, a religious group, the Communion of Saints. Different human tasks are more properly ordered to some communities than to others. If we have a clear understanding of who we are as persons, then we can know which activities are rightly ordered to which communities.

But what precisely is this common task to be carried out in the temporal order? After ruling out various possibilities, Maritain writes, in another passage, that the common task to be carried out is not the medieval idea of an empire of God to be built here below, and it is even less the myth of Class, Race1 Nation or State, but it is, rather:

the idea-- not Stoical or Kantian, but from the Gospel- of the dignity of the human person and of his or her spiritual vocation, and of the fraternal love which is due to that person. The task of the political community would be to bring about a common life here below, a temporal regime truly in conformity with this dignity, this vocation, and this love. We are far enough away from [such a regime] to be sure that we have our work cut out for us!l

This is not to say that the spiritual vocation of a human person is the only vocation, or that, specifically, civic friendship is all that is required for life in common. What makes a society just or unjust is not only its spirit but also its structures. Maritain balances the preceding remarks with the following:

> Such a conception [of a temporal regime] would be utopian if the fraternal friendship which we are talking about were seen as the only bond linking the temporal community and its only basis. No, we know that a certain material and in some sense biological weight of common interests and drives -- and of social animality, so to speak-- is indispensable to life in common.z

This is more than just a theoretical statement. It comes only after Maritain has spelled out some of its implications on such issues as freedom of the press, joint ownership of the means of

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 217f. " ... l'idee, -- non pas stoicienne ni kantienne, mais evangelique, -- de la dignite de la personne humaine et de sa vocation spirituelle, et de l'amour fraternel qui lui est du.

My intention is not to chronicle what Maritain has to say about each of these issues; concrete applications for France in the 1930's obviously need some adjustment for North America in the 1990's. There are particular points, however, which can give us some idea of the sort of thing Maritain has in mind. On the issue of joint ownership of the means of production, for example, Maritain writes that corporate organization must be thought of as being established from the bottom up (de bas en haut), according to what he calls personalist democracy. This involves suffrage and active personal participation of all concerned at the grassroots, together with the unions which represent them.2 Being a shareholder is not enough; in fact, Maritain mentions the critique that being a shareholder often means nothing more than cutting out coupons. He is arguing for an active role for all concerned, and the underlying presupposition is that despite the inevitable conflicts in industrial relations, labor and management have a common interest in the running of a business.

Another application which Maritain provides is the role of technology} Maritain criticizes communism for having trapped human beings-- despite every claim to the contrary- in a society in which a science of the non-human, a science of the production of things, dominates the lives of humans. Even within the Marxist framework, and not only within industrial capitalism, human beings are at the service of technology and industry. Neither capitalism nor communism, in other words, have succeeded in liberating human beings from the producerconsumer dialectic. And Maritain states the reason: if the task of the social whole is not ordered to the higher goods of the person, it cannot claim the entire person for itself, for God is the supreme interest (interet) of the person. The solution

*<sup>2</sup>Jbid.,* p. 203:

<sup>3</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 208.

which Maritain envisages is not indeed to repudiate technology and industry, which are good in themselves, but to place them at the service of a genuinely human ethic which subordinates technology to the good of human beings. Maritain is not merely pushing for the reform of the present economic system; he is arguing for a fundamental readjustment of priorities. He does not reject the technological ethic outright, but he wants this ethic to be subordinated to a higher law. It is a question of choices based on a value system which puts the good of human persons first. Or, as Maritain writes in another place:

> It is a question of a total and as though substantial recasting [of the temporal order], of a reversal of the principles of culture, since it has to do with arriving at a vital primacy of quality over quantity, of labor over money, of the human over the technical, of wisdom over science, of common service to human persons over individual greed for infinite wealth or Statist greed for unlimited power)

Maritain was, and is, correct in saying that we have our work cut out for us.

I *Ibid.,* p. 222. "(C)'est d'une refonte totale et comme substantielle qu'il s'agit, d'un renversement des principes de la culture, puisqu'il s'agit d'arriver a une primaute vitale de la qualite sur la quantite, du travail sur !'argent, de l'humain sur le technique, de la sagesse sur la science, du service commun des personnes humaines sur la convoitise individuelle d'enrichissement infini ou la convoitise etatiste de puissance illimitee."

Compare John Paul II, Encyclical "Redemptor hominis", para. 16 (Acta apostolicae Sedis 71 [1979], p. 290): "But what properly signify that 'kingly duty' [i.e., of political leaaders] and that 'dominion' of man over· the visible world, assigned to man by the Creator himself as a duty, if not to put ethics before technology, the person before things, spirit before matter?" ("Quid autem proprie significant illud 'regale munus' illudque 'dominium' hominis in mundum visibile, homine ab ipso Creatore ut munus tributum, nisi ethicam antecellere rei technicae, personam rebus praestare, spiritum materiae praecedere?")

#### Les Droits de l'homme et la loi naturelle ( 1942)

The works already cited furnish the essential elements of Maritain's treatment of the human person as whole. His subsequent works go over much ground which has already been covered. My intention, in the next two subsections, is to deal only with those points which constitute a development of what has already been discussed.

In Les Droits de l'homme, Maritain spells out, although in somewhat less technical language than in Humanisme integral, his fundamental thesis that the person is a whole, and that this wholeness is the foundation of human dignity.

Maritain begins by insisting that a human person is not only a piece of matter. He holds that all other animals are material only. He does not mention animals' having souls, but the presumption is that he holds, with Aristotle, that the souls of animals other than humans are a potency of matter. A human being is an individual (in the sense already described) who takes himself in hand by understanding (intelligence) and will:

> {H)e [man] does not exist merely in a physical way; there is a richer and higher existence in him. He superexists spiritually in knowledge and love. He is thus in some way a whole, and not only a part. He is a world unto himself, a microcosm in which the entire, larger world can be contained by knowledge, and who can give himself freely out of love to those who are like other selves to him. It is impossible to find the equivalent of this relationship in the whole physical world. I

<sup>1</sup> Jacques Maritain, *Les Droits de l'homme et la loi naturelle,* (New York: Editions de la Maison Fran<;aise, Inc., 1942), p. 15. "(l)l n'existe pas seulement d'une fa<;on physique, il y a en lui une existence plus riche et plus elevee, il surexiste spirituellement en connaissance et en amour. Il est ainsi en quelque maniere un tout. et non pas seulement une partie, il est un univers a lui-meme, un microcosme. d<ms lequel le grand univers tout entier peut etre contenu par la connaissance. et qui par l'amour peut se donner librement a des etres qui sont a lui comme

If we push too far the notion that a person is a whole, there is a risk that human persons will be portrayed as self-sufficient, atomic units, not needful of any social relationships. The statement in the above quote that a person is a world unto him- or herself could easily be interpreted in that vein. Maritain is aware of this risk. He is quick to add that a human person is not a closed whole but an open whole I, who tends by nature to social life and communion with others. This is the case not only because we need others in order to meet the needs of our earthly existence, but also because our natural generosity and desire to communicate and to love, necessitate life with others. Society is a requirement of human nature. How, then, do we describe the relationship between a person and society if a person is already a whole? Maritain's answer is that society is a whole composed of parts which are themselves wholes. Each part, each person, is endowed by the Creator with freedom, and therefore persons are not parts of an organic whole. The task (oeuvre, once again) and the good of society are not the same as the task and the good of a particular person, but since a society is composed of human persons, its task and its good must be human if society is to do justice to human persons. This is the fundamental notion behind Maritain's claim that a just society will embody an ethic which puts persons over things.

But which is more important, the whole or its parts? Does the political community exist for the particular good of each of its members? Maritain is clear on this point. To put human beings before things is not to subordinate the political community to its individual members. And the good of the political community is not the sum of the goods of its members.2 Maritain calls such a view anarchy. In fact, he

refers to an individualistic society as having anarchist tendencies; that is to say, such a society may claim to put each individual first, when in fact it gives the rich and powerful free rein to dominate the poor and weak. The good of the political community is the, common good which diffuses itself to each member of society.

The picture which Maritain presents of the relationship between the soul and the body is his way of accounting for the fact that the common good of the political community is not the same thing as the sum of the particular goods of its members. Besides repeating the notion that the human person is on the lowest level of personhood on account of his or her being joined to a body, Maritain writes that if human society were a society of pure persons, the good of society and the good of each person would be one single good. But since the human person is not a pure person, the person is that of "a poor material individual, of an animal which is born more deprived than the other animals ... [the human person is] stripped and miserable, ... poor and full of needs."l That humans are animals, there is no doubt; that our bodily nature has many needs which must be met, this is beyond controversy. The difficulties occur when we seek to spell out the consequences of our composite (i.e., body-soul) nature. One gets the impression that the body, on Maritain's view, is an encumbrance to the soul, and that the soul would be better off without it: the soul would not be weighed down by material needs. Once again, it is the distinction between person and individual which is at work here. The distinction does have its merits: it seeks to explain our being part of a political community, although not completely a part of that community. Our social nature surely has a limit, but perhaps this limit is not coterminous with the limit between body and soul.

<sup>1</sup>*Ibid.,* p. 25. "(L)a personne humaine est celle d'un pauvre individu materiel, d'un animal qui nait plus depourvu que les autres animaux ... [la personne- humaine est] denuee et miserable ... .indigente et pleine de besoins."

There are clues in subsequent pages as to how various aspects of our lives are subordinate to the political community and others are not. According to Maritain, a human person surpasses and is superior to all temporal societies by virtue of his or her relation to the absolute, in that he or she is called to a life and· a destiny beyond time. I This absolute to which a person tends includes the highest requirements of personhood as such, and the temporal common good is subordinate to these demands as an intermediate end. Quoting the same two passages from the Summa theologiae which illustrate the tension in our relationship to the political community2, Maritain formulates the paradox that we can commit ourselves entirely to the political community, even to the point of giving our lives, and yet we do not commit ourselves according to everything that is in us. Maritain's examples illustrate what he means by this paradox. Philosophers and runners give their whole selves to their respective activities, but they do not carry out these activities by virtue of their whole selves but by virtue of their understanding and running ability respectively) In other words, a philosopher's reasoning faculty is part of that person, but not the whole person. A runner's coordination and physical strength and speed are part of that person, but not the whole person~ It is difficult to see how the political community can claim for itself the whole person, unless there is simultaneously a higher law than the temporal order at stake. 4

Our relationship to the political community is not the only aspect of our lives. There are goods and interests which supersede the political sphere. The example cited by Maritain

<sup>4</sup>It is one thing to claim that various aspects of a person's life are ordered to realities higher than the political community, and it is another thing to claim that the person transcends the political community. _ The first claim does not entail the second. See Chapter Four of this thesis, on the controversy between Charles De Koninck and I. Th. Eschmann, o. P.

is instructive: mathematicians learn their profession by means of certain educational institutions which would not be possible without the political community, and the community can call upon these people to teach mathematics. However, the community cannot force them to hold certain mathematical propositions as true, nor can the community make them put mathematics at the service of an ideology, whether that ideology be of the Left or of the Right.l Mathematics concerns the order of absolute goods of the person as such. The temporal order is indispensable in serving that order, but precisely in serving, not in co-opting, realities which do not fall within its grasp.

## La *personne et le bien commun* (1947)

In this work, Maritain spells out more clearly than before the exact nature of his philosophical project. The fundamental question is: Does each one of us exist for society, or does society exist for each one of us? If we answer an exclusive "yes" or "no" to either of these questions, then we are making a mistake.2 Personalism is in effect a reaction against a categorical answer to either of these questions. It seeks to formulate a balanced view between individualism (the belief that each of us belongs to him- or herself) and totalitarianism (the belief that each of us belongs to the State). Personalism is, not one; but several positions between these two extremes, with some coming close to either of the extremes. In setting up this theoretical picture, Maritain is making the point that he does not associate himself with each and every system of thought which calls itself "Personalist". He identifies himself more as a Thomist than as a Personalist.

The reason for which each person belongs to him- or herself, to the State, and in an absolute sense to God, is that

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 31.

<sup>2</sup>Jacques Maritain, *La personne et le bien commun,* (Paris: Desclee De Brouwer, 1947), p. 8. ·

there is an order of goods, and that a person serves each of these goods in proportion to its level of importance:

> Each intellectual substance is made (1) for God, the separate common good of the universe, ( 2) for the perfection of the order of the universe (to the extent that it is not only the universe of bodies but also of spirits), and (3) for itself; that is, for the (immanent and spiritual) action by which it perfects itself and fulfills its destiny .I

There are two presuppositions underlying this ordering of goods. First, the temporal realm, as part of (human) nature, falls under the order of the universe. We are parts of a political community in that we were made for the ordering of the created universe. Secondly, the universe does not, in the Christian cosmology, stand between a person and God. The fact that God is the common good of all of creation does not prevent him from being the supreme (although obviously not private) good of each person.

The passage from Aquinas to which Maritain refers illustrates how it is that rational or intellectual creatures stand apart from the rest of the universe in their relation to God:

> Among the parts of the universe, each and every creature is for the sake of its proper act and perfection. Secondly, the more ignoble creatures are for the sake of the more noble, just as creatures which are below man are for the sake of man. Further, individual creatures are for the sake of the perfection of the whole universe. And further, the whole universe, with each of its parts, is ordered to God as its end, in that by some imitation of divine goodness, the glory of God is made present in them -- although rational creatures above [all] in some

<sup>1</sup> Ibid., p. 13 (footnote). "Chaque substance individuelle est faite, 1° pour Dieu, bien commun separe de l'univers, zo pour la perfection de l'ordre de l'univers (selon qu'il est non seulement l'univers des corps mais aussi des esprits), et 3° pour elle-meme, c'est-a-dire pour l'action (immanente et spirituelle) par laquelle elle se parfait et accomplit sa destinee".

special way have God as their end, whom they can attain by their operation, knowing and loving. I

It is our being ordered to the good of the universe which accounts for the fact that we belong to a political community; the good of the universe is in the order of nature, and being social or political animals is part of our nature. Secondly, it is our having a rational nature which orders us immediately to God. This is why the political community does not have an absolute claim on us. More precisely, its domain over us does not extend to those things which pertain to our knowing and loving: religion, the arts and sciences, family relationships, and all other forms of friendship. And yet, all these other activities and relationships are made more difficult in a society which is not just. When, however, the temporal realm is in good health, it serves these other aspects of human life and enables them to flourish.

None of this takes away the built-in tension in the relationship between a human person and the social whole, nor does it take away the perennial risk of either insisting too strongly that a person is a whole, or of interpreting univocally the fact that a person is a part of the political community. The reason, acc:ording to Maritain, is that there are two different orders of goods at stake. When comparing the good of the person with the good of the community, Maritain writes that the good of the community is greater than the good of the person in terms of those earthly values by which a person is a member of society. Examples of such values are justice and

<sup>1</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, *Sf* Ia, 65, 2. "(I)n partibus universi, unaquaeque creatura est propter suum proprium actum et perfectionem. Secunda autem, creaturae ignobiliores sunt propter nobiliores, sicut creaturae qui sunt infra hominem sunt propter hominem. Ulterius autem, singulae creaturae sunt propter perfectionem totius universi. Ulterius autem, tatum universum, cum singulis suis partibus, ordinatur in Deum sicut in finem, inquantum in eis per quandam imitationem divinae bonitatis repraesentatur ad gloriam Dei-- quamvis creaturae rationales speciali quodam modo supra habeant finem Deum, quem attingere possunt sua operatione, cognoscendo et amanda."

civic friendship. In the sense that a person tends toward values which transcend the political community, however, it is the good of the person which has primacy.l Aquinas puts it this way:

> The good of the universe is greater than the particular good of one [person], if each [good] is taken in the same genus [i.e., of nature]. But the good of grace of one person is greater than the good of nature. of the whole universe.2

Attempts by any political community to own people will ultimately meet with failure. At the same time, a person's attempts to live an individualistic life will meet with frustration, because an asocial life is a sheer impossibility. This tension is part of our human existence, and we do violence to some part of ourselves if we try to resolve it in one direction or the other.

# IV

In conclusion, we have seen that our understanding of what it means to be a human person has a direct bearing on the way in which we formulate the relationship between human persons and society. The analysis of Aristotle's and Aquinas' treatment of the one, a part, and a whole, show us

lMaritain, op. *cit.,* p. 72f. A personbeiongs to several communities at once. The good of a person as member of a higher community than the polis (e.g. religious groups) has primacy over the good of a person as member of the political community. One ambiguity in Matitain's text is that transcendent goods of the person are made to sound like private goods. This ambiguity creates a problem for the interpretation of the text.

<sup>2</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, op; *cit.,* Ila IIae, 113, 9 ad 2, quoted by Maritain in a footnote on p. 14. "(B)onum universi est majus quam bonum particulare unius, si accipiatur utrumque in eodem genere. Sed bonum gratiae unius majus est quam bonum naturae totius universi." It must be emphasized that this does not mean that every good of grace is a private good. Any common good of grace is greater than the good of grace of one person alone.

that a human person is one of those beings whose substance is one, and which is one in form. When we say that a person is a whole, this implies that the various aspects of a person's life (the various parts of that person) are ordered in a certain way. In particular, the relationship between the body and the soul, the relationship between the material and spiritual parts of us, is one of substantial unity, such that 'person' is said of a bodysoul composite substance. The genus under which a person falls (i.e., having-a-sensory-nature) is taken from that which is material in the person, while the sensory nature itself is only part of the person. The specific difference (i.e., having-arational-soul) is taken from that which is non-material in a person, while the rational soul itself is only part of that person.

A whole, according to one meaning, is a natural being. An individual being is more properly a whole than is a group of individuals. It is by analogy that a person is said to relate to society as part to whole, and yet the disposition to form human societies is part of human nature.

jacques Maritain, in his distinction between person and individual, seeks to come to grips with the fact that we are both spiritual and material, and that this has consequences in public life. He rightly identifies the tension involved in a person's relationship to society: namely, that we are in some sense part of a political community, all the while tending toward goods which themselves transcend the political realm. The weakness in Maritain's position lies in his insufficient emphasis on the unity of the spiritual and the material within us. Rather than dividing the claims of the State upon us along the lines of the limit between body and soul, it is preferable to view the issue of person and society in terms of a person's relationship to an entire order of communities with a corresponding order of goods, the highest of which is God. The perennial challenge, with its corresponding tension, is to distinguish clearly the material and spiritual values to which we order our lives, all the while avoiding any semblance of dualism.

# CHAPTER TWO PERSON AS AN INDIVIDUAL SUBSTANCE OF A RATIONAL NATURE: THOMAS AQUINAS

The person is that which is most perfect in the whole of nature; that is, something subsisting in a rational nature.

Thomas Aquinas *ST,* la, 29, 3.

## I.

The word 'persona' in Latin has a long and complicated history, a history closely related to that of the Greek 'pros6pon'. Before delving into the philosophical meaning of 'persona' when used by Thomas Aquinas, it is useful to make an etymological note, not in order to provide any definitive etymological study of 'pros6pon' and 'persona', but in order to underline the fact that these two words, like all technical terms, have literal meanings which facilitate the understanding of their more technical use.

Maurice Nectoncellel notes that it was only after much development that 'pros6pon' came to signify an individual human being. 'Soma' (body) was first used to denote the individual:

1 Maurice Nedoncelle, "Prosopon et persona dans l'antiquite classique" *Revue des sciences religieuses* (1948), pp. 277-299.

When, in the fourth century, Lycurgus speaks of the *'soma'* who handed over the city, it is impossible not to translate: the individual, or even the personality or dignitary of the city. For it was a term of nobility and did not apply to slaves at first. It even happens that it designates juridical individuality, the group of rights which constitutes a free man, a bit like *caput* in Latin.l

In a footnote, Nedoncelle adds that Xenophon refers to both free and servile *'somata',* which indicates the extent of meaning even at that early date. Modern English has retained a similar use of the word 'body' to mean an individual human being, as found in the words 'everybody', 'anybody', 'somebody', and 'nobody'.

The original, literal meaning of *'pros6pon'* is "face" .2 From there, it came to mean the front surface or fac;:ade of a thing. The ancient meaning for which *'pros6pon'* is best known is that of a theatre mask, a kind of second face.

Subsequent developments had *'pros6pon'* meaning the personage or character in a play, the role played by an actor.3 The meaning then evolved into the role played in life, one's social personality. The final development consisted of *'pros6pon"s* coming to mean an individual or person in general. In the writings of Polybius (c. 201-120 B.C.), we find the full extent of the evolution of the meanings of *'pros6pon'* to that point in time. According to Schlossmann, as cited by Nedoncelle, *'pros6pon'* in Polybius' writings means, not yet an indivdual *tout court,* but an aspect or role, sometimes an individual who plays a role. It can also mean a person who distinguishes him- or herself in a group; also moral dignity, the

lfbid., p. 278. "Lorsque Lycurgue au Ne siecle parle du 'soma' qui a livre la cite, il est impossible de ne pas traduire: l'individu, ou meme, la personnalite, le notable de la ville. 11 arrive meme qu'il designe l'individualite juridique, le groupe de droits qui constitue un homme libre, un peu comme *caput* en latin." 2Jbid., pp. 278f. 3Jbid., p. 281.

dignity even of a group. Polybius writes of the name and prosope of Hellas.

It was not until the Christian era that 'pros6pon' began to mean an individual or a person. In Latin, however, this evolution took place earlier for 'persona'. About a half-century before Christ, Cicero used the word in that sense. 'Persona *Laelii'* means Laelius himself, with a bit more solemnity.!

'Prosopon.' is found several times in the New Testament. Examples include Acts 10: 34, Rom. 2:11, Gal. 2:6, James 2: 9, and Jude 16. In every case, the Vulgate translates 'pros6pon' as 'persona•.z All these passages except the one from jude make reference to being a respecter of persons; that is, to show partiality. There is also, in the New Testament, the expression 'kata pros6pon' which means "in the presence or• or "by the mandate or·.

The development of the meanings of 'persona is quite different from that of 'prosopon'. Whereas in Greek the original meaning of 'pros6pon' is "face", the original meaning of 'persona' is "mask".3 'Personare' means to resound, to make a loud noise, literally to send sound through something, much as one lets his or her voice resound through a mask. It is a point of controversy whether 'persona' is derived from 'personare' because the "o" in 'persona' is long, while the "o" in 'personare' is short.

As for the likelihood of 'persona''s being derived from 'pros6pon', Nedoncelle raises the question of there having been an intermediate Latin word 'perso(p)a'.4 He points out that there is a problem with this theory on account of the fact that 'pros6pon' is neuter whereas 'persona' is feminine. How could there have been a change of gender in the derivation? One

1 Nedoncelle does not give the reference. *2Ibid.,* p. 282. 3 *Ibid.,* p. 28Sf. 4 *Ibid.,* p.291.

possibility, though not mentioned by Nedoncelle, is that 'persona' could have come from the neuter plural'pros6pa'.l

In an effort to limit himself to the least adventuresome possibilities among the various competing theories, Nedoncelle draws the following conclusions concerning the origins of the word 'persona':

> 1. 'Persona' takes its origin either from the proper name 'Persepona' or from an archaic adjective related to 'phersu' ["mask" in Etruscan].

> 2. We have no reason to think that there is a root common to 'pros6pon' and 'persona'; even less can we believe that the latter word derives from the former.

> 3. 'Personus' (= that which resounds) and 'persona' must have come together early in the subconscious of the Romans. The first masks probably enlarged the head without reinforcing sound. From the psychological standpoint, however, they invited the actor to project his voice. Later on, masks probably included devices which made it easier to let one's voice carry.2

After signifying a mask, 'persona' next came to mean the role played by an actor. The word then came to mean, in grammar, the person of a verb. It was only after this

<sup>1</sup> I am deliberately leaving aside the discussion of the Etruscan word *'phersu',* and of the possibility that *'persona'* is derived from this word. _The details of this discussion are interesting, but not to the point of this thesis. I refer the reader to Nedoncelle's article.

development that 'persona' came to mean an individual human being.

The whole gamut of meanings is to be found in Cicero. Most significantly, an early philosophical meaning is already present: namely, human nature, either in that it is strictly individual, or in that it participates in reason.!

After Cicero, only a few more developments took place. Some nuances were added, and some rare usages became commonplace. Valerius Maximus, who lived under Tiberius Caesar, uses the expression 'necessariae personae' to mean relatives, or members of an extended family.2 More generally, Noooncelle speculates that 'persona' gained more prominence once 'vir' ("individual man", as opposed to the species man) disappeared from common usage, such that 'homo' (usually the species) came to mean most often an individual man. It is interesting to note that, in contemporary English, 'person' is gaining prominence as part of the effort to use genderinclusive language. 'Man' is coming to mean most often an individual man rather than the species. One problem, as we shall see later, is that 'person' is neither the name of a species nor that of a genus.

# II

Let us now turn to the principal writings of Thomas Aquinas on the human person.

#### Summa tbeologiae

The definition of 'person' which Aquinas adopts is that of Boethius: "A person is an individual substance of a rational

I "Intelligendum est duabus quasi nos a natura indutos esse personis, quarum una communis est ex eo quod omnes participes sumus rationis ... ; altera autem quae proprie singulis est tributa." (De off., I, 107) Quoted-by Nedoncelle on p. 298. 2 *Ibid.,* p. 298.

nature." (De *duabus naturis,* 3 ).1 A person by definition is something singular or individuated. It is not a class of things, whether that class be a species, a genus, or a category. Rather, persons are to be found within the category (supreme genus) of substance. Persons are those individuated substances which have a rational nature. The expression 'rational nature' here denotes an intellectual nature; it is analogical, not univocal like a genus or a species. The word 'person' is attributed to Gcx:i in an eminent way. Human persons are not the only kind of persons; there are also angelic2 persons as well as the Divine Persons of the Trinity. One special characteristic of persons is their capacity to act by themselves. If the general and the singular are to be found in a particular way in the genus of substance, the individual is in that genus in a special and perfect mode:

> But yet in some more special and more perfect mode, that which is particular or individual is found in rational substances, which have dominion over their actions, and are not only acted upon as though by another substance, but act by themselves. But actions are in singulars. And therefore among other substances, singulars of a rational nature have some special name, and that name is 'person'. And therefore in the above definition of 'person', 'individual substance' is placed, inasmuch as it signifies a singular in the genus of substance; but 'rational nature' is added, inasmuch as it signifies a singular among rational substances.3

"Sed adhuc quodam specialiori et perfection modo invenitur particulare et individuum in substantiis rationalibus, quae habent dominium sui actus, et non solum aguntur secundum sicut alia, sed per se agunt. Actiones autem in singularibus sunt. Et ideo etiam inter ceteras substantias quoddam speciale nomen habent singularia rationalis naturae, et hoc nomen est 'persona'. Et ideo in praedicta

More will be said later about the precise meaning of each word in the definition of 'person', what each word is intended to include and also exclude. In the meantime, the principal point to be kept in mind is that 'person' always signifies a singular being, an individual, and that, having a rational nature, these individuals are capable of acting by themselves and not only by virtue of another.

We must be clear as to which meaning of 'substance' is being used in the definition of 'person'. By 'substance' Aquinas means primary substance, the same as *'hypostasis'* in Greek. In Latin, *'substantia'* is ambiguous: it can mean either a singular being existing by itself and capable of assuming accidental being, or it can mean the essence of a thing, that whiCh makes a thing to be the kind of thing that it is. Aquinas specifies that *'hypostasis'* or *'substantia prima'* excludes from the definition both universals and parts of things. 'Man' as said commonly of all people is not a primary substance; also, a hand or some other part of the person (including the soul) is ruled out of the definition because, although singular, it is only a part. A person is a singular being who is also a whole.

To use the word 'individual' in the definition is not exactly the same thing as to affirm that a person is a primary substance. Something else is being added. A thing is individual when it is indistinct within itself and distinct from others.l An individual substance, besides being a primary

definitione personae ponitur 'substantia individua', inquantum significat singulare in genere substantiae; additur autem 'rationalis naturae', inquantum significat singulare in rationalibus substantiis.'

Boethius gives the word 'rationale', which is fitting for God, angels, and humans. Cf. De Potentia 9, 3, ad 7, last sentence in response. (Quaestiones disputatae, Vol. II, Taurini: Marietti, 1953).

lJbid., Ia, 29, 4, c.: "Therefore 'person' in each and every nature signifies that which is distinct in that nature; just as in human nature it signifies this flesh, these bones, and this soul, which are individuating principles of man; which indeed, although they are not from the meaning of 'person' in common, are nevertheless from the meaning of 'human person'."

substance, is one which is not assumed by another, is not taken on by another. To make this point clear, Aquinas uses an example from theology. The human nature of Christ is not an individual substance because it has been assumed by something greater: namely, the divine essence.! An individual (primary) substance, rather, is one which is its own proper subject of existence, and which does not exist by virtue of another.2

For the sake of precision, it is useful to spell out three ways of understanding a singular being: as a subsistence, as a thing of a certain nature, and as a hypostasis or primary substance:

> A thing is called 'subsistence' to the extent that it exists by itself and not in another; for we say that those things subsist which exist not in another but in themselves. But to the extent that it supposes some common nature, it is thus called 'a thing of [some] nature', just as this man is a thing of human nature. But to the extent that it supposes accidents, it is called 'hypostasis' or [primary] 'substance'. But what these three names signify in the genus of substances as a whole, the name ··person' signifies in the genus of rational substances.3

<sup>(&#</sup>x27;"Persona' igitur in quacumque natura significat id, quod est distinctum in natura illa; sicut in humana natura significat has carnes, haec ossa, et hanc animam, quae sunt principia individuantia hominis; quae quidem, licet not sunt de significatione 'personae' in communi, sunt tamen de significatione 'personae humanae'.") l]bid.

<sup>2</sup>cf. De Potentia, 9, 3, ad 7. "Although there are no accidents in God, nevertheless there are personal properties in him. Hypostases stand under these personal properties." ("Ad septimum dicendum quod, licet in Deo non sint accidentia, sunt tamen in eo proprietates personates, quibus hypostases substant.")

<sup>3]</sup>bid. la, 29, 2, c. "Secundum enim quod per se existit et non in alio vocatur 'subsistentia'; illa enim subsistere dicimus quae non in alio sed in se existunt. Secundum vero quod supponitur alicui naturae communi sic dicitur 'res naturae', sicut hie homo est res humanae naturae. Secundum vero quod supponitur accidentibus dicitur 'hypostasis' ~el 'substantia'. Quod autem haec tria nomina significant communiter in toto genere substantiarum, hoc nomen 'persona' significat in genere rationalium substantiarum."

The referent is the same in all three cases. These three terms are called intentional names, in that they refer to the singular being under certain aspects, and thus aid the understanding in grasping the structure of a particular reality. For a rational substance, the word 'person' includes everything that is understood by the three intentional names just mentioned .. A perSOJ?. exists by itselfl and not in another; a person is also of a certain nature, whether divine, angelic or human. Finally, a person is a primary substance which has accidental being existing in it. (For God, however, everything in him is his essence. There is no accidental being in God.)

A consequence of the fact that a person is a singular being is the fact that individuality is part of what it means to be a person. Aquinas spells this out by distinguishing between the meaning of 'essence' and the meaning of 'person'.2 It is the· essence of composite beings, for example, to have both matter and form. 'Essence' refers to the principles of the species to which certain singular beings belong, but it does not refer to individuality. In other words, the essence of composite beings is to have matter and form, but nothing is said of *which* matter or *which* form. It is individuality which identifies *this* matter and *this* form. To use Aquinas' example, it is part of the explanation of man to have a soul, flesh, and bones, but it is part of the explanation of this man to have this soul, this flesh, and these bones. A person is this particular body-soul unity.

The discussion of personhood in the writings of Aquinas is primarily a theological discussion. As he writes in the commentary on the *Sentences* of Peter Lombard, "The word 'person', as to the thing signified, pertains first and more truly to God than to creatures, but as to the mode of signifying and the imposition of the word, it is suitable more usually to

<sup>1</sup> I am using the word 'itself' here instead of 'himself' or 'herself' because I ani referring to all persons, and not just human persons. 2Jbid., Ia, 29, 2, ad 3.

creatures."l There is a close relationship between the various impositions of the word 'person': what is said of God is useful in understanding what is said of human persons. This is particularly the case in Aquinas' treatment of the relationship between personhood and dignity. First of all, Aquinas writes that 'person' signifies that which is most perfect in the whole of nature; that is, something subsisting in a rational nature.2 In the case of human persons, it is true that, as mentioned above, the entire human being, body and soul, is a person. It is by virtue of the person's rational nature, however, that a human person derives that dignity which is not shared with other material creatures nor even with other animals. It is not the rational nature alone, understood separately from the body, which gives a human person his or her dignity; it is, rather, the fact that the whole person has a rational nature, and that the other faculties are ordered to that nature. And yet, to have a rational nature is different for human beings from what it is for angelic beings and for God. Aquinas quotes Richard of St. Victor (De Trin., IV, 22, PL 196, 945) who writes that 'person', when said of God, means incommunicable existence of divine nature.3 In the case of God, a rational nature does not refer to discursive reasoning but to God's ability to understand all things at once. And when we say that God is individual, 'individual' here does not mean being an individuated member of a species but rather to be incommunicable; that is to say, it is impossible for there to be more than one Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. And 'substance', when said of the divine Persons means, not a being which supposes accidental being, but rather a being which exists by virtue of itself. Human dignity consists in our

Ist. Thomas Aquinas, *Scriptum super libros Sententiarum magistri Petri Lombardi, episcopi Parisiensis.* (R. P. Mandonnet, O.P., ed., Paris: Letheilleux, 1929), I, 25, 2, ad 3. "Ad tertium dicendum, quod hoc nomen "persona", quantum ad rem significatam, prius et veri us est in Deo quam in creaturis, sed quantum ad modum significandi et impositionem nominis familiarius convenit creaturis."

<sup>2</sup>sr, Ia, 29, 3, c. " ... persona est id quod est perfectissimum in tota natura, scilicet subsistens in rationali natura." 3 *Ibid.,* Ia, 29, 3, ad 4.

ability to understand, not as God understands, but according to our own mode of understanding. And since rationality involves the ability to act by oneself,· our dignity consists in the ability to act intelligently and not just according to the dictates of instinct; to act freely and not just according to the dictates of necessity)

# *Commentary on the Sentences* of *Peter Lombard*

The section of the *Sentences* dealing with personhood pertains primarily to the Trinity. My purpose is not to go into the meanings of 'person' as referring to the Persons of the Trinity, nor to repeat what is written more concisely in the *Summa theologiae,* but to spell out the common meaning of 'person', whatever the nature of that person. The applications to human persons can be deduced from the common meaning ..

Aquinas distinguishes between the meaning of 'hypostasis' (primary substance) and that of 'person':

<sup>1</sup> Although the capacity to understand and the capacity to act freely are the distinguishing characteristics of human dignity with reference to the species, this does not mean that the dignity of a particular person is confined to the actual exercise of these higher functions. Existence is a cause of which activity is an effect. Our perfection consists in our existence, and this perfection remains intact even when the actualization of certain capacities is impeded. To cite an extreme case, when a person is impeded from carrying out rational activity because of severe brain damage or a severe mental handicap, this privation does not entail any diminution of human worth. For more on this topic, see Philip Smith, O.P., "Personhood and the Persistent Vegetative State" Linacre Quarterly 5712 [1990], pp. 49-58.

See also *sr,* lila, 19, 1, ad 4. "It is of the nature of a person to exist and to act, but one in one way and the other in another. For to exist pertains to the actual realization of a person, and so as such it is to be considered in the explanation of a limit [i.e., that in which the perfection of a being consists] .... But activity is a certain effect of a person according to some form or nature." ["Actual realization" is the translation given by the Blackfriars Edition.] ("Ad quartum dicendum quod esse et operari est personae a natura: aliter tamen et aliter. Nam esse pertinet_ ad ipsam constitionem [sic] personae; et sic quantum ad hoc se habet in ratione termini .... Sed operatio est quidam effectus personae secundum aliquam formam vel naturam.")

(T)hat which is distinguished can be signified either concretely, thus the word 'person'; or in the abstract, thus the word 'hypostasis'. Or in another way: because it can be signified as distinguishable (by the word 'hypostasis') or as that which is distinguished (by the word 'person'). Or again: because it is either signified as distinct by some determinate property pertaining to nobility, thus the word 'person'; or as distinct absolutely from any property, hence the word 'hypostasis'. I

The context is a discussion of how the divine Persons of the Trinity are distinct one from another. Two points can be kept in mind here. First, the word 'person', rather than being an intentional name, designates a singular being of a particular form, of a particular designated matter (if material), and of a particular nature. 'Person', taken commonly, does not specify which form, matter, or nature, but 'a human person' specifies one particular body, one particular soul, and one particular human nature. Secondly, Aquinas points out that a thing is called 'person' by virtue of some property pertaining to dignity or nobility.2 In the case of the divine Persons, 'person' pertains to the divine nature, bur in the case of a human person, that nobility or dignity is taken from that person's human, rational nature. The reason for which animals are not called person is that they lack this rational nature.

lin I Sent. 23, 1, 1, sol. "Distinctum potest ... significari vel in concretione, et sic est nomen "persona", vel in abstractione, et sic est nomen "hypostasis". Vel aliter: quia potest significari ut distinguibile, et sic significatur nomine "hypostasis"; vel ut distinctum, et significatur nomine "personae". Vel aliter: quia vel significatur ut distinctum aliqua proprietate determinata ad nobilitatem pertinente, et sic est nomen "personae", vel distinctum absolute quacumque proprietate, et sic est nomen "hypostasis".

<sup>2</sup>Peter Lombard's definition of 'person' is: "a hypostasis distinct by a property pertaining to nobility" (hypostasis distincta proprietate ad nobilitatem pertinente -- In I Sent., 25, 1, 1, end of article). StThomas gives this definition only passing mention because, as he writes in the same passage, Peter Lombard's definition deals with a distinguishing property of a person, while Boethius' definition identifies the rational nature of a person as the distinguishing property. Actually, it is this rational nature by which a person derives its dignity, a dignity not shared with non-personal beings.

Aquinas' definition of 'person' mentioned in the commentary on the *Sentences* is somewhat different from Boethius' definition ("an individual substance of a rational nature") also mentioned in the same commentary. The definition quoted in L. 23, art. 2, ad 2 is "something complete in an intellectual nature" (quid *completum in natura intellectuali).*  A variant of it is "something subsisting by itself in an intellectual nature" *(per se subsistens in intellectuali natura,* cf. solution of the same article). Aquinas seems to be using the word 'intellectual' instead of the word 'rational' in order to apply the defmition broadly to all persons including the divine Persons of the Trinity. 'Rational', though correct, has its root in *ratiocinari,* to engage in discursive reasoning. As for the use of . 'something complete' or 'something subsisting by itself' instead of 'an individual substance', Aquinas is placing the emphasis on the perfection or wholeness of the singular being calleq 'person'. A person is a being in its complete state. In the case of a human person, this involves the fact, albeit accidentally, that a human person is a composite being:

> For since 'person' means something complete in an intellectual nature, and since completeness can be found in human nature only through the greatest composition, therefore 'person' accidentally signifies composition in nature. I

It is to be recalled that 'something complete' is a variant of 'an individual substance'. If, for a human person, to be complete means to be a composite of body and soul, then to be an individual substance also means to be a composite of body and soul.

Aquinas spells out a number of ways in which the words 'individual' and 'person' can be understood. We have already

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* 25, 2, ad 2. "Q}lla enim "persona" dicit quid completum in natura intellectuali,_ et in natura humana non invenitur complementum nisi per maximam compositionem; ideo per accidens significat compositionem in natura."

seen that in one sense 'individual' means something complete or whole. 'Individual', writes Aquinas, can be understood in two ways. One way is to see it as a word of second intention. 'Individual' or 'singular', in such a case, does not mean a singular thing; rather, it refers to singularity or individuality. Also, 'individual' can be a word of first intention; that is, it can refer to the thing itself of which individuality is a characteristic. 'Person' is an example of a word of first intention. Aquinas adds that we can speak of the word 'person' in two ways: either by itself, in that we speak of what 'person' means by itself; or accidentally, in that we understand 'person' for what it means in a particular nature) A person, then, is an individual in the sense in which 'individual' refers, not to a quality, but to a concrete object bearing that quality. Also, the two ways of understanding the meaning of 'person' account for the analogicity of 'person' when used of different kinds of persons:

> By itself, ['person'] means an individual intellectual substance, whichever that might be, and in whichever way it might be individuated [i.e., by matter or otherwise]. But if a human person is understood, it means that which is subsisting in such a nature [i.e., a human nature], and which is distinguished by such a distinction as is suitable to human nature; that is, a determinate nature.2

In the case of one of the divine Persons, 'person' still means an individual intellectual substance, only this time it means that which is distinct existing in the divine nature. In the analogy of personhood, it is individuality (or incommunicability) and intellectuality (in its various forms) which remain constant

<sup>1</sup> Ibid., 23, 1, 3, sol.

<sup>2</sup>Jbid., "Per se quidem significat substantiam intellectualem individuam, quaecumque sit illa, et qualitercumque individuetur. Si autem accipiatur persona humana, significat hoc quod est subsistens in tali natura, ·et distinctum tali distinctione qualis competit naturae humanae, scilicet per naturam determinatam."

throughout. The difference in the analogy is due to the differences resulting from various natures.

# Disputed Questions on the Power of God

By a process of elimination, Aquinas identifies what the defmition of 'person' includes, and also what it excludes:

> Therefore because [a person] is called 'substance', accidents (none of which can be called a person) are excluded from the explanation of 'person'. But because (a person] is called 'individual', genera and species of substance in the genera (which cannot be called persons either) are excluded. But because 'of a rational nature' is added, inanimate bodies, plants, and brutes (which are not persons) are excluded.!

Within the genus of substance, and only within that genus, 'person' denotes only individuals, and only those individuals which have a rational nature, whichever that rational nature might be.

If 'person' denotes an individual or singular being, and not a kind or class of beings, then how is it that the various referents of 'person' have anything in common, such that 'person' is capable of definition? Responding to the objection that singular beings cannot be defined, Aquinas answers that 'person' denotes a particular nature's mode of existing.2 There are three things to consider in a particular substance:

> ( 1) the nature of the genus and species existing in singular beings.

lDe *Potentia* 9, 2, c. "Per. hoc ergo quod dicitur *substantia,* excluduntur a ratione personae accidentia quorum nullum potest dici persona. Per hoc vera quod dicitur *individua,* excluduntur genera et species in genera substantiae quae etiam personae dici not possunt; per hoc vera quod additur *rationalis naturae,* excluduntur inanimata corpora, plantae et brilta quae personae non sunt." [ *2Jbid.,* 9, 2, ad 1.

(2) that nature's mode of existing.

In each individual there exists the nature of a species and genus as proper to that individual and not as common to many. A nature can exist only in individuals, and is common if there are at least two individuals. To use Aquinas' example, there is no man who is not some particular man, except in the opinion of Plato, who held that there are separated universals.

(3) The third thing to consider in a particular substance is the principle from which that way of existing is caused.

This is the principle of individuation, and it is not common but proper to the individual. As Aquinas puts it, one principle of individuation is in one particular &ubstance and another principle is in another substance, because this singular being is individuated by this matter, and that singular being by that matter.

Now, the words which signify each thing to consider in a particular substance are common or proper in aq:ordance with the things which they signify. Thus,

> (la) The word which signifies a nature ('man' or 'animal', for example) is common and can be defined.

> ( 2a) The word which signifies a nature's mode of existing ('hypostasis' or 'person') is also common and also can be defined.

> (3a) But a word whose meaning includes a determinate principle of individuation ('Socrates' or 'Plato') is not common (unless by pure equivocation, although Aquinas does not mention this), and cannot be defined.

'Person', as signifying a nature's mode of existing, is common to more than one singular being just as that nature (e.g., human nature) is common to more than one singular being. But when it is taken as a word of first intention, 'person' has one singular being as its referent. Much as there is no man who is not some particular man (number 1 above), there is no person who is not some particular person (number 2 above). "Person' is common to more than one singular being; what makes 'person' different from 'man' or 'animal' is that the word 'person' is used to signify a thing subsisting in such and such a nature, not an individual from the point of view of its nature. A person is not a species but a special mode of existing. As Aquinas puts it in the Summa theologiae:

> "It is worth noting that 'some man' signifies an individual from .the point of view of nature with a way of existing suitable to singulars; but the word 'person' is not used to signify an individual from the point of view of nature, but rather a thing subsisting in such and such anature."l -

One final word about the meaning of 'nature' in this context.2 As Aquinas points out, 'nature' in Boethius' defmition is not being used in the Aristotelian sense of a principle of motion, but as Boethius defines it in De duabus Naturis: "each and every thing which is giving form by a specific difference."3 Now, the specific difference of a thing completes its definition and determines the species of that thing. For this reason, writes Aquinas, 'nature' is more suitable to the definition of 'person' than is 'essence', which is much more general. The genus under which 'person' falls is that of substance; the

<sup>1</sup>ST, Ia 30, 4, c. "Hoc ... interest quod 'aliquis homo' significat individuum ex parte naturae cum modo existendi qui competit singularibus; hoc autem nomen 'persona' non est impositum ad significandum individuum ex parte naturae, sed ad significandum rem subsistentem in tali natura."

<sup>2</sup>DePot., 9, 2,ad 11.

<sup>3&</sup>quot;unumquodque informans specifica differentia". No reference is given.

specific difference is that of having-this-or-that-rationalnature.

# III

In conclusion, the niajor writings of Thomas Aquinas on personhood provide a developed and nuanced treatment of the meanings of the word 'person'. Aquinas' original intention was to use this word in order to express how there can be something distinct within the divine nature without there being more than one God. It is only secondarily that Aquinas uses the word 'person' to refer to individual beings other than God, human beings included. And yet, it is in relation to Aquinas' discussion of God that we gain insight into what it means to be a human person.

'Person' is a word used commonly of individuated instances of various natures within the genus of substance. When used of human beings, it refers to particular individuals as whole beings in their complete state, and not only as parts of some larger entity, such as a species or some subordinate group within the species. However, 'person' does also include, like "some man", the point of view of human nature, but it signifies the thing subsisting in such a nature.

To call a human being a person is to refer not only to that person's mode of being but also to that person's mode of acting. A human person has dominion over his or her actions. We act as a consequence of the deliberation and decisionmaking of which we are capable by virtue of our ability to understand and to will. We are capable of acting upon the reality which surrounds us and, although we are material and therefore live within the horizons of material reality (space and time), we are not completely subject to necessity. With regard to all other material beings, however, it is more true to say that they are acted upon than to say that they act. We, however, bave some measure of understanding and some measure of freedom.

Besides pointing to a particular referent, the word 'person' also carries with it a richness of meaning which includes several intentional names. 'Person' means a subsistent, existing by itself and not by virtue of another or in another. It also means a thing of a certain nature (res naturae), a singular being inasmuch as its extension is that which gives form by a specific difference. Thirdly, 'person' denotes that individual thing inasmuch as it .is a primary substance, inasmuch as it "stands under" (substat) accidental being. 'Person', then, denotes one and the same referent under three different forms of intentionality.

Finally, the meaning of 'person' denotes an individual being with reference to a property pertaining to dignity. That property is rationality as delimited by a particular rational nature. It is by virtue of their rational natures that human persons are the most perfect among material beings in nature. Our perfection lies in the composition of body and soul, while the perfection .of pure spirits lies in their simplicity. This composition is one of substantial (and not merely accidental) unity of matter and substantial form.

Since Aquinas' writings on personhood are primarily about the Trinity, it is to be expected that the passages dealing' with human persons leave out much that needs to be said.l One such lacuna is the relationship of each person to his or her environment, and specifically to other human persons. That is the topic of the next section.

lThere is much to be said about the dignity of human persons in strictly theological terms, beyond the scope of philosophy. For a theological treatment of this subject, see Servais Pinckaers, "La Dignite de l'homme selon Saint Thomas d'Aquin" De Dignitate hominis, (Freiburg-im-Breisgau: Verlag Herder, 1987),-pp. 89-106. See also Hans Urs von Balthasar, "On the Concept of the Person" Communio 13 (Spring, 1986) 18-26. For a philosophical treatment which pays particular attention to the relationship between personhood and intimacy, see Kenneth L. Schmitz, "The Geography of the Human Person" Ibid., pp. 27-48.

#### PART TWO

## THE COMMON GOOD

# CHAPTER THREE COMMONADVANTAGEANDCOMMONGOOD

I

During the 1930's and 1940's, there was a great deal of debate, sometimes quite intense, on the nature and limits of the common good. Is the common good a final cause, the greatest good of a human person? Or, is it a means by which a· person attains his or her private good? This debate took place in a particular historical context, that of the Fascist and Stalinist totalitarian regimes in Europe. The philosophers involved in this debate confronted the challenge of formulating a political philosophy which, all the while recognizing the value of the role of the State, emphasizes the dignity of the human person -- without, however, reducing this dignity to the interests of the individual in the classical liberal sense.

The problem of the common good is still relevant today, at a time when political discourse often seems to oppose the good of the political community to that of each of its members. In this context, reference to 'the common good is often interpreted as opening the door to totalitarianism, as constituting an implicit if not explicit threat to the rights ·of the individual. By the same token, the good of a human person is sometimes perceived in opposition to that of a people or a nation, with the latter being reduced to the role of a mere means.

In this chapter, I intend to trace the roots of this debate in Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics and his Politics. Then, I shall describe the way in which Thomas Aquinas takes up this discussion in his philosophical and theological writings. As this inquiry will show, Aristotle poses the question of the common advantage, not in opposition to the advantage of a particular citizen, but in opposition to the private interests of those in power. Aquinas poses the question in the same context. The development which Aquinas brings to this discussion consists of specifying that the political common good is situated in a hierarchy of common goods, and that it is not the only common good which must be considered.

#### I I

For Aristotle, politics is based on ethics. Legislation must foster the good life so that each citizen can live happily. In Book I, Chapter 2 of the Nicomachean Ethics (1094b8-ll), Aristotle writes that it is more "godlike" to obtain and preserve the good of the whole political community than that of one man alone, although the good is worth being pursued even for only one man. In this regard, Thomas Aquinas notes that the good is a final cause. Now, a cause is more powerful when it extends to several effects. The good of all citizens, therefore, takes precedence over that of one person. In commenting on the word "godlike" ( theioteron) used by Aristotle, Aquinas explains that God is the ultimate cause of all goods, and that the political good is godlike (divinum) by similitude.! Thus, the common good is "divine" (like God, or-- according to Aristotle-- like the god) in the sense that the political good is the last final cause in a given order. that of human affairs.

The good is that which is desired for itself, as an end in itself and not as a means subordinate to an end. Referring to

<sup>1</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, In decem libros Ethicorum Aristotelis ad Nicomachwri expositio. (Raimundus M. Spiazzi, 0. P., ed. Taurini: Marietti, 1964), I, 2, 30.

the political good, Aristotle speaks of the self-sufficiency of the good (1097a35-1097b22). Happiness, which Aristotle identifies with the ultimate good, is "sufficient" in itself; it alone makes life complete and lacking in nothing. Aristotle takes care to note that the sufficiency of happiness, and therefore of the good, is not conceivable in a strictly individual perspective. In order to be complete, happiness must extend to one's spouse, one's children, one's relatives and fellow citizens. As we shall see later, happiness is a common good, of which the personal possession is not to be found without a life in common, which is the sharing of happiness.

In his commentary, Aq\linas notes that the selfsufficiency of the good implies the fact that happiness is the good in its complete state.l The endpoint of a natural movement, he writes, must be complete (integrum), since nature is not lacking in what is necessary. Thomas uses the example of the end of human generation: just as this end is the generation of a complete human being and not of a human being lacking one of its members, so the ultimate end of life must be the complete and entire good. Happiness, being what suffices to make life complete, is precisely this complete good.

At the very end of the Nicomachean Ethics, in Book X, Chapter 10, Aristotle develops the notion that the good life presupposes life in common, and he makes the transition from ethics to politics (1179b31-1180a13). On his view, legislation is necessary to train people in virtue. Few of us heed the force of argument, but most of us are prepared to accept necessity. Those who live for pleasure are sometimes motivated by the fear of pain. While few accept constraints imposed by another person, most are willing to accept a given state of affairs if the law obliges them to act in a certain way. It is the educative aspect of the law which Aristotle wishes to insist upon. The good life, far from being an asocial or pre-social condition, implies the existence of a set of laws which make citizens

1 Ibid., I, 2, 107 ..

happy by fostering virtue, for happiness, on Aristotle's view, consists in virtuous action.

# III

In making the transition from ethics to politics, Aristotle moves from the ultimate gcxxl of human life to the common advantage of all members of the political community. In order to understand the way in which Aristotle situates the common advantage in his political theory, we must first consider the finality of the political community. As Aristotle states at the beginning of the Politics, the city is the most complete of all communities, and it encompasses all other communities. No community exists only for itself; each has an end to which it tends, and this end is a gcxxl (12 5 2a 1-6). And since the city is the highest of all communities, it follows that the good to which this community tends is also the greatest good, or at least the greatest good accessible in the sublunar sphere.

In his commentary on this passage, Aquinas notes that

[Aristotle] is showing that the good to which the city is ordered is the highest among human goods, for this reason. If all communities are ordered to a gcxxl, then the highest community must be the most apt to discern the good which is the highest among human goods. For the proportion of things which are means to an end must be according to the proportion of ends.l

There are two aspects which should be pointed out here. First, Aquinas emphasizes the fact that the gcxxl in question is a

<sup>1</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, *In libros Politicorum Aristotelis expositio.*  (Raimundus M. Spiazzi, O.P., ed. Taurini: Marietti, 195 1), I, 1, 11. *"Ostendit quod illud bonum ad quod ordinatur civitas est principalissimum inter bona humana, tali ratione.* Si omnis communitas ordinatur ad bonum, necesse est quod illa communitas quae est maxime principalis, maxime sit coniectatrix boni qui est inter omnia humana bona principalissimum. Oportet enim quod proportio eorum quae sunt ad finem, sit secundum proportionem finium." (The emphasis is that of Aquinas].

human good. As we shall see later on, the political good, for Aristotle, is a good relative to the citizen. Now, since every political community is composed of human beings, and can be composed only of human beings, the good to which the political community tends is a good relative to humans, and attainable by humans. Secondly, Aquinas makes explicit the analogy of proportionality between the hierarchy of human communities and the hierarchy of ends to which these communities are ordered. The common advantage is closely linked to the political community in that this community is identified with justice and friendship. The common advantage defines the political community and makes it an end: the end toward which the lower communities (families and villages) are ordered.

In fact, Aristotle points out that the development of the political community is a process of nature (1252b27-1253al). The city has its origin in a group of villages which are populous enough to be more or less self-sufficient. Each of these villages is organized around the rudimentary needs of life; that is the good to which it tends as to an end. A group of villages develops naturally to become a political community. This time, however, the goal of political organization is not merely to provide what is basic for survival. Rather, the goal of the political community is the good life: the possibility of attaining happiness, of engaging in virtuous actions, of participating in the government of the city and, in general, of sharing the benefits which only life in common can provide. This common life is in harmony with nature in the sense that the nature of a being is the perfection of that being in its complete state or full development. Now, life in common finds its perfection in the formation of a self-sufficient and self-governing political community. The political community is thus the end of a natural process.

At this juncture, it may be useful to explain a point of terminology. Aristotle uses most often the expression 'sumpheron koinon' (common advantage), and only rarely does

he use the expression 'agathon koinon' (common good). Aquinas, in commenting on Aristotle's works, most often uses 'utilitas communis' (common advantage or utility), but he uses 'bonum commune' (common good) as well. Is there a distinction between these two manners of speaking? It seems that 'utilitas communis' and 'bonum commune' are interchangeable in the writings of Aquinas. But are they really interchangeable? It seems to me that we must spell out the specific character of Aristotle's conception of the political good, in order to point out why Aristotle speaks of the common advantage right after stating that every community organizes itself in order to pursue a good. It is not the Platonic Gocxl which is in question here -- that Good which transcends all levels of the "divided line" of the Republic (509d-Slle), and which transcends even philosophic wisdom itself. The Platonic Good is present, to be sure, at every level of knowledge, and it is true that, for Plato, even true opinion participates in this Good. Nonetheless, in order to accede to the eternal and unchangeable essence of the Good, one must look beyond the changeable world of appearances. For Aristotle, however, the good of a being, just as the form of that being, is to be found in that singular being. The good of a being is distinct from the Idea of the Good, or the Good in itself, which is at the summit of the hierarchy of Ideas. To put it another way, the good, for Aristotle, is the good of someone or something. The common good is the good of all members of a political community once these members have actualized their disposition to live in common. They organize themselves in view of the good which political life can provide them; they enjoy the advantages of life in common. And these advantages can vary from one period of time to another, and also from one place to another. just as the good of a singular being is capable of finding concrete expression in different ways according to the contingencies of place and time, so the advantages of political life are not the same at all times and in every place. In using the expression 'common advantage', Aristotle is spelling out the

63

character of the good specific to the city: it is the good of all citizens. Such a terminology would have been inconceivable for Plato.

Is it possible to name the good to which the political community tends? In formulating the meaning of 'z6on politlkon' (political animal), Aristotle answers that question:

> Now, that man is more of a political animal than bees or any other gregarious animals is evident. Nature, as we often say, makes nothing in vain, and man is the only animal whom she has endowed with the gift of speech. And whereas mere voice is but an indication of pleasure or pain, and is therefore found in other animals (for their nature attains to the perception of pleasure and pain and the intimation of them to one another, and no further), the power of speech is intended to set forth the expedient and the inexpedient, and therefore likewise the just and the· unjust. And it is characteristic of man that he alone has any sense of good and evil, of just and unjust, and the like, and the association of living beings who have this sense makes a family and a state (1253a7-18).1

A privileged example of the common advantage is justice. Adhesion to this right rule consists in the use of language in order to promote and to defend the good of all citizens, and to cast aside what is harmful to them. It is interesting to note that in the context of political life, the role of language is not so much to express truth as to communicate concerning what is just and useful.Z In order to promote justice in the political community, it is necessary, among other things, to assure justice in the distribution of wealth and responsibilities. So that these deliberations can be carried out, there has to be a common forum where a public debate is held. In other words, political life is deliberation and decision, hence the importance

lAll translations of Aristotle's works are taken from The Basic WorkS of *Aristotle,* (Richard McKeon, ed., New York: Random House, 1941).

<sup>~</sup>My thanks -to Prof. John R. Gallup who, in conversation, drew my attention to this point.

of language. Among animals other than man, even among gregarious animals, everything is done by instinct. The actions of other animals do not belong to the moral sphere. But human beings are free, political animals who consequently have a sense of the just and the unjust. All common human undertakings presuppose civil communication.

The essential point to be kept in mind here is that politics is a fundamentally practical or moral activity, and not a speculative or metaphysical enquiry. That is why, in emphasizing the importance of language in public affairs, Aristotle does not mention the True as such, but the True in the order of justice and utility. Inasmuch as it is a moral activity, politics has as its goal what is true in the practical order, what is truly for the good of the political community. And the common advantage is the good specific to the political realm. That does not mean that the True as such has no place in public life. For Aristotle, the contemplative life (i.e., the life of rational activity) is the end or goal of the practical life. But the practical life comes before the contemplative life. The common advantage precedes the contemplative life and makes it possible, in that the common advantage consists in the practice of the virtues, especially justice. More than that: the common advantage extends to the contemplative life, which is the pinnacle of all the activities of the political community.

# IV

In addition to being the end to which the political community tends, the common advantage also serves to distinguish a just political regime from a corruption thereof.

A sign which Aristotle gives to indicate that political leaders are administering the community for the common advantage is that they are ready to take turns governing (1279a7-21). Civil authority seems to consist in an exchange: citizen A cares for the interests of citizen B for a certain number of years, and then it is citizen B's turn to look after the

interests of citizen A. Both citizens are on an equal footing in that each is willing to govern and to be governed. What is remarkable here is that Aristotl~does not posit any conflict between the common advantage and the particular good of each citizen. If political leaders serve the common advantage, then the interests of particular citizens are well served at the same time. This harmony deteriorates, however, when a political leader governs not for the common advantage but for his own advantage: either the enjoyment of public revenues, or the pursuit of the prestige which accompanies an office or function. To illustrate this point, Aristotle uses the somewhat colorful image of a man who seems to need political power in order to remain in good health. Thomas Aquinas, in his commentary on this passage, makes explicit what is at stake in the comparison. He writes:

> But afterward, men ... want to be always governing, as though to govern were to be healthy, and as though not to govern were not to be healthy. For it is thus that men seem to desire governance like sick people desire health.l

Health is a private gooq, a good which belongs only to the person who possesses it, and which cannot be shared with others; In a similar way, a corrupt leader desires the advantages of governance as a private good which cannot be shared. And that is what distinguishes a true from a corrupt political regime.

Even though Aristotle discusses at length the relative merits of government by one person alone, by a small number, and by the multitude, he emphasizes that the distinction among governments according to the number of rulers is not the primary distinction in his analysis. The true forms of

<sup>1</sup>st. Thomas Aquinas, *In Ill Polit.,* 5, 389. "Sed postea homines ... volunt semp_er principari, ac si principari esset sanum esse, et non principari, esset infirmum esse. Sic enim videntur homines appetere principatum, sicut infirmi appetunt sanitatem."

government are those by which the leaders carry out their function in view of the common advantage, whatever the number of rulers.! The principle at stake here is that citizenship implies participation in the advantages of life in common (1279a28-33). We can see in this principle the centrality of citizenship in the Aristotelian schema of justice. The reason for which Aristotle does not envisage the participation of slaves in public life is that a slave, by definition, is not a citizen. When we try to account for the difference, in this regard, between the city-state as described by Aristotle on the one hand, and modern States on the other hand, we see that the difference consists primarily in a new conception of citizenship: throughout the centuries, the progressive widening of admissibility to citizenship necessitated a parallel widening of the recognition of rights. In the 19th century, the tailing into question of slavery in the United States was provoked, among other things, by the fact that slaves had already been recognized as citizens several

lAquinas comments: "From what has just been said, [Aristotle] concludes the distinction between upright and unjust political communities. For, since it is thus that the governance of free people is ordered to the advantage of the subjects, it is obvious that in each political community where the political leaders oversee the commmon advantage, these are upright political communities according to justice taken by itself. But in each constitutional government where only the leaders' advantage is cared for, those communities are perverse, a kind of corruption of an upright political community. For what is just is not to be found there simply, but in a restricted sense ... For [the political leaders] govern an authoritarian political community using the citizens as slaves; that is, for their own use. And that is against justice, because a political community is a community of free people. A slave is not a citizen, as has already been said." (In III Polit., S, 390)

<sup>(&</sup>quot;Concludit ex dictis distinctionem rectarum politiarum ab iniustis. Cum enim ita sit quod principatus liberorum sit ordinatus ad utilitatem subditorum, manifestum est quod in quibuscumque politiis principes intendunt communem utilitatem, illae sunt rectae politiae secundum iustitiam absolutam: in quibuscumque vero politiis intenditur sola utilitas principantium, illae sunt vitiatae et corruptiones quaedam rectarum politiarum: non enim in eis est iustum simpliciter, sed iustum secundum quid ... Principantur enim dominativae civitati utentes civibus sicut servis, scilicet ad suam utilitatem: et hoc est contra iustitiam, quia civitas est communitas liberorum: servus enim non est civis, ut supra dictum est.") [The emphasis is that of Aquinas.]

decades earlier. It was then a matter of recognizing the rights which flow from citizenship, so that these individuals could be citizens in fact and not only on paper. And to be a citizen in fact, one must have the possibility of participating in the advantages of public life, of governing as well as being governed-- a task which, at least in the treatment of minority groups, is still not complete in most countries, and has not even begun in others. The common advantage is theadvantage of citizens: the capacity to participate in the advantages of public affairs presupposes citizenship.

In order not to give a mere caricature of Aristotle's relatively narrow conception of citizenship, we must bear in mind that, for Aristotle, citizenship, though quite restrictive, is not a function of wealth (128lb33). Following Solon and some other legislators on this point, Aristotle gives the poor the right to vote as well as the right to nominate magistrates. He believes that the dominant classes would have a better judgment if they acted in conjunction with the poor. Aristotle does not, however, admit the possibility of the the poor governing alone.

Whereas in Book I Aristotle analyzes the common advantage in terms of the hierarchy of communities (the highest being the political community), in Book III he sees the common advantage from the point of view of the hierarchy of sciences. just as each community is organized in view of a certain good, each science, also, is carried out for the sake of a good. Now, political science is the highest of practical sciences, and the good which it envisages is justice. Here, Aristotle identifies justice with the common advantage (1282b15-19).1

<sup>1</sup> Peter of Auvergne, ·who completed the commentary . of Thomas Aquinas on the *Politics* after Aquinas' death, explains the hierarchy of sciences in the following way: "In the first point, [Aristotle] says that in all arts and in all sciences (i.e., practical arts and sciences), the end is a certain good, because all teaching and all art (but similarly, action and operation) seem to desire a certain good, as is said in the first book of the *Ethics.* But if the end of any art and any science is a certain

As he continues, he notes the consensus of his contemporaries to the effect that justice implies a sort of equality. Specifically, he states that proportional equality takes the form of a distribution of responsibilities according to the excellence of the candidates; that is, inasmuch as they possess the qualities required for a particular function. He considers excellence in other domains as less important than the capacity to exercise the office for which a person is elected or chosen. And if the best candidate occupies a lower social status than the other candidates, this fact does not disqualify that candidate. It is to the common advantage that the political community be governed by the best people, and precisely by people who are excellent in governing. ·

Aristotle makes another mention of the common advantage, this time in Book IV (1296a32-36), where he explains the reason for which, on his view, constitutional governments were rare in Greece. The reason is that the rich and poor were concerned only for the interests of their preferred form of government (oligarchy and democracy respectively), without being concerned for the good of the

good, then the end of the best and highest art and science is the best and highest good, because among things taken by themselves, just as what is simply is to what is simply, so the more is to the more, and the most is to the most. But political science is the highest among all practical, active sciences, as has been shown in the first book of this work; for the end of political science should be what is highest and best. But the good aimed at in politics is what is just simply; i.e., in the order of that to which the just tends simply. And this is the good which is conferred in common. Thus, the good conferred in common is the end in politics." *(In* III *Polit.* 10, 441)

<sup>(&</sup>quot;In primo dicit quod in omnibus artibus et scientiis, scilicet operativis, finis est aliquod bonum, quia omnis doctrina et ars, similiter autem actus et operatio bonum quoddam appetere videtur, sicut primo *Ethicorum* dicitur. Si autem cuiuslibet artis et scientiae finis est aliquod bonum, principalissimae est finis optimum et principalissimum; quia in his qui sunt per se, sicut simpliciter ad simpliciter, ita magis ad magis, et maxime ad maxime. Sed inter omnes scientias practicas activas politica et [sic] principalissima, ut ostensum est in primo huius: quare finis eius debet esse principalissimum quid et optimum. Sed bonum intentum in politica est illud quod iustum est simpliciter, idest in ordine ad quod attenditur iustum simpliciter, et tale est bonum conferens communiter: ergo bonum communiter conferens est finis in politica.")

entire political community. For Aristotle, the best form of government, in most cases, is a constitutional government established and governed by the middle class. He considers this form as a just mean between governments of the rich and those of the poor because, in both of the other cases, social relationships are characterized by domination and servitude. By favoring the middle class, Aristotle hopes to promote a situation in which social relationships have some measure of equality, where some people govern and others are governed in view of the advantage of all. Such governments were rare in antiquity, and it is realistic to expect them to be no less rare in ourownday.

From what has just been said, it is not difficult to conclude that there are many cases in which the common advantage does not exist at all. In Book V, Chapter IX, Aristotle provides a portrait of such a scenario:

> Neither should we forget the mean, which at the present day is lost sight of in perverted forms of government; for many practices which appear to be democratical are the ruin of democracies, and many which appear to be oligarchical are the ruin of oligarchies. Those who think · that all virtue is to be found in their own party principles push matters to extremes; they do not ,consider that disproportion destroys a state. A nose which varies from the ideal of straightness to a hook or snubmay still be of good shape and agreeable to the eye; but if the excess be very great, all symmetry is lost, and the nose at last ceases to be a nose at all on account of some excess in one direction or defect in the other; and this is true of every other part of the human body. The same law of proportion equally holds in states. Oligarchy or democracy, although a departure from the most perfect form, may yet be a good enough government, put if anyone attempts to push the principles of either to an extreme, he will begin by

spoiling the government and end by having none at all (1309b17-34).1

In either form of government, there are policies and measures which save or destroy that form of government. In order to save a constitution, Aristotle insists that the rich and poor be included in the governance of the city. Where there is government by the few (and it could well be argued that some modern democracies are in fact governed by the few), the ruin of such states consists in contempt for the poor. And where there is government by the multitude, its ruin consists in contempt for the rich. So that the common advantage can exist in a political community, the government must be as inclusive and as participatory as possible; in other words, all groups which form the political community must be able to participate in its governance.

# v

The conception of the common advantage underwent several developments following its formulation by Aristotle. The writings of Thomas Aquinas provide a notable example of the fact that in order to "Christianize" Aristotle, it was necessary also to Christianize the notion of the common advantage (now "common good"). The most remarkable difference between the teaching of Aristotle and that of Aquinas is that, for the latter, the political community is not the highest form of community. So that the Aristotelian notion of the common advantage could be harmonized with Christian faith, it was necessary to harmonize this teaching with that concerning the Communion of Saints, because eternal life is lived in common, and because ~ere is a close link between the earthly city and the heavenly city. Thus, when a Christian

philosopher speaks of the common good, one must immediately ask the question, "Which one?". The answer is not always apparent. Sometimes it is the good of a nation or of a people, at other times the good of the entire political community, and at other times the good of the. entire community of human beings, in this world and in the next. I n an art i c1 e published in The New Scholasticism in 1989, Gregory Froelich analyzes the ambiguities involved in any discussion of the common good, and he goes so far as to say that the expression 'common good' is equivocal.! In analyzing Froelich's thesis on the different meanings of the expression 'common good', I intend to provide the reader with a kind of road map which will help to identify the principal issues in the debate and to avoid confusion concerning the different kinds of commof\ good.

As Froelich rightly states, we find in the works of Aquinas an impressive array of examples of the common good,2 but there is no one work by Aquinas dealing with the common good as such. Froelich postulates that the reason for the absence of such a work is that the many examples of the common good have no unity:

> Certainly St. Thomas could not have in mind the same idea of "bonum commune" when he applies it to happiness (a quality of the human soul) and to the order of the universe (a relation) and to children (substances). Even the most general and flexible term "ens", which is

lGrego~y Froelich, "The Equivocal Status of Bonum Commune ", The New Scholasticism LXIII (Winter, 1989), pp. 38-57.

<sup>2</sup>The examples of the common good which Froelich cites are as follows (cf. note on p. 42 of Froelich's text): Money, honor: In V Ethic., lect. 4, n. 927. Victory: In XII Meta., lect. 2, n. 1303. Justice: ST, la llae, q. 19, a. 10; In IX Ethic., lect. 6, n. 1839. Peace: ST, Ia llae, q. 96, a. 3 ad 1; £e regimine principum c; 2. Happiness: SCG, III, 39; ST, Ia llae, q. 3, a. 2 ad 2. Perpetuation of the species: QJJodl. I, q. 4, a. 3 [8] ad 3; Q D. de malo, q. 15, a. 2 ad 12. The order of the universe: Desubst. sep., c. 12, n. 113;In XII Meta., lect. 12. The good convertible with being: *ST,* la, q. 17, a. 4 ad 2; ST,_ Ia llae, q. 55, a. 4 ad 2.

predicable of every category, is, as St. Thomas argues, an analogical and hence equivocal term. It seems to follow then that "bonum commune" is an equivocal expression. In fact, its equivocity rivals that of "ens", since its two components are themselves highly eq uivocal.l

We must first spell out what is meant by the expression 'equivocal'.2 In Book I, Chapter 6 of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle states that goods are called good by equivocation, but he specifies right away that it is not accidental equivocation or equivocation by chance (that in which the equivocal terms have nothing in common except the name), but rather equivocation pertaining to one good, or possibly an analogy of proportionality:

> But what then do we mean by the good? It is surely not like the things that only chance to have the same name. Are goods one, then, by being derived from one good or by all contributing to one good, or are they rather one by analogy? Certainly as sight is in the body, so is reason in the soul, and so on in other cases (1096b26- 30).

In his commentary on this passage, Aquinas distinguishes equivocations by chance (a casu) from equivocations the meanings of which are not completely diverse, but which converge in a certain way by their reference either to an efficient principle (military equipment is called military because it is used by military personnel), or to an end (a remedy is healthful because it restores health), or to a subject (a quality is a being because it is a disposition of a substance). Perhaps it is better to speak of a proportion between several subjects (sight is to the body as the intellect is to the soul). We can now ask about the relationship among the meanings of the

expression 'common good' in Aquinas' writings. As we shall see, we have here an analogy with reference to one good, of which the first analogue is the common good in causando. Some authors, however, prefer to speak of an analogy of proportionality.

Froelich mentions, first of all, the common good in predication (bonum commune in praedicando), or the common good of which the community is simply logical, such as that of a genus or species. The common good in question here is a predicate~ In the Summa theologiae, Aquinas makes the distinction between the common good of which the community is comparable to that of a genus or species, and the common good according to final causality,! The question is formulated as follows: Is law always ordered to the common good? It is a matter of reconciling the common good which is the end of law, and the particular acts which law commands. Aquinas answers that particular acts which law commands are not parts contain.ed in the common good understood as a logical whole, but these acts belong to the community of a final cause.2

In order to illustrate this distinction between the bonum in praedicando and the bonum in causando, Froelich makes use of the example of happiness} On his view, if happiness is a common good, it is such only according to the community of prediCation, on a very general level. Happiness is an operation, an activity and consequently a purely personal good. People seek happiness in many different ways. Happiness, envisaged in its community, has thus no reality and resembles the Platonic Good. On this point, Froelich's view differs from that of Aquinas, for whom happiness (or felicity) is the *end* of the human species. Happiness is a common good, accessible to all human beings provided that there is nothing impeding their attaining it. In the minor work On the Perfection of the Spiritual Life, Aquinas points out that

lsr, Ia Ilae, 90, 2, ad 2.

<sup>2</sup>Jbid. .

<sup>3</sup>Froelich~ op. cit.,p.47.

in this community by which all people agree on happiness as an end, each and every man is considered as a certain part: but the common good of the whole is God himself, in whom consists the happiness of all.l

Note the distinction between 'whole' and 'all'. God is the common good of the whole (the human species considered as one, as an ordered whole). At the same time, the happiness of *all* (i.e., each and every part of the whole) is found in God. In God consists my happiness and yours because, as members of the human species, we desire God as our ultimate end. The concrete differences among the happiness of individual human beings lie in the degree of apprehension2 (if any) which accompanies this desire, and in the intermediate goods (real or apparent) which are chosen as means. Happiness is the good of the human species and of each of its parts, much as, *mutatis mutandis,* the political common good is the good of the community as a whole, and the good of each of its members. This good must become effective. By contrast, the good in general, the common good according to the community of predication, is not the good of the human species, but rather the private good of the individuals to whom it is being attributed. It consequently has no role in political life.

Ist. Thomas Aquinas, *De perfectione vitae spiritualis,* c. 13, n. 634, in *Opuscula theologica* (Vol. II, Raimundus M. Spiazzi, O.P., ed., Taurini: Marietti, 1954). "In praedicta autem communitate qua omnes homines in beatitudinis fine conveniunt, unusquisque homo tit pars quaedam consideratur: bonum autem commune totius est ipse Deus, in quo omnium beatitudo consistit."

In his commentary on the *Nicomachean Ethics,* Aquinas writes that "what belongs to the end of a nature should be common to all those who have that nature." Thus it is important that happines, which is the end of human nature, be common (at least potentially) to all those who possess this nature. The common good of the whole extends to each of its parts. Cf. *In I Ethic. XN,* 170.

<sup>2•</sup>Apprehension' is being used here in the technical sense of a sensory, emotive, or intellectual grasp; it is not being used in the popular sense of hesitation.

As an example of the common good according to causality, Froelich proposes one of the three goods of marriage: the procreation and education of children (the other two goods being fidelity and the sacrament). The transmission of life and the upbringing of children constitute, beyond a doubt, the common good of the spouses. Their union is ordered to this end, and it is an end common to both. Here, the distinction between the common good according to predication and the common good according to causality becomes clear. Children are the common good of the father and of the mother: the common good of both, and not a private good of either of them. A private good is exclusive. In this case, however, "mine" and "yours" are not separate from the "ours" of a common good understood as a final cause.

In order to situate the political common good in the analysis of the common good as a final cause, Froelich distinguishes between extrinsic and intrinsic common goods. The former exists separately from those who desire it {for example, the destination of a group of travelers), but the latter exists within those who desire it. The political common good falls under the second category:

> (T)he common good is the good of the whole community. But since the political community is an ordered whole, not an organic whole or a disordered pile, its good consists in the preservation and tranquillity of order. Such a good is not taken in opposition to the good of a single man, for it is as a part of that order that man finds his highest natural perfection. As St. Thomas argues, only through the civil order is man put within the reach of the virtues, which once attained make him the best of animals. Outside of the civil order, without justice and law, man becomes the worst of animals, since being armed with reason he can turn even the virtues to the worst ends. The political order, then, is a good for each citizen belonging to it. It is an intrinsic common good. I

1 Froelich, *op. cit.,* pp. 52f.

The political common good is a function of the internal order of the community, an order characterized by justice and law (as opposed to the will and, at times, the whim of political leaders). Even though individuals have the capacity to attain their natural perfection, they cannot realize this capacity except as members of the political community. For each has the disposition to live in common with his or her peers. This disposition, which is part of human nature, must be realized so that other dispositions, such as the disposition to virtue, can be realized as well.

The third kind of common good is related to distributive justice, which deals with what the community owes to each citizen. Aquinas calls these goods bona communia, common goods to be distributed among individuals according to their merits or their contribution to the good of the political community. For Froelich, the principle at work here is that the goods which are part of the transactions on the level of commutative justice can also be distributed by the structures of the political community. These goods are common because they are held in common until distributed to members of the community. After distribution, these goods become private goods. Froelich uses the example of the water in the municipal reservoir) So long as this water remains in the reservoir, it is part of the common stock and does not belong to anyone in particular. Once this water passes through someone's tap, however, it becomes a private good. This example is not quite right. In the case of the water in the municipal reservoir, we are dealing with a public service rendered by the community, for which the community exacts a special tax or a payment at regular intervals. This service could conceivably be rendered just as easily by a private individual or group. Distributive justice, on the other hand, is the prerogative of the leaders of the political community, who distribute wealth and

responsibilities on the basis of the quality of persons and their ability to promote the common good. If the bona communia in question are material goods, then they come from public property or from a new distribution or allotment of private property.

# Table 3.0 Schema of the Common Good

- I. Common: (De Veritate 7, 6, ad 7)
1. "by predication; when, that is, some one thing is found in many according to one explanation.''

2. "by mode of cause, just as a cause which, remaining one in number, extends to several effects."

II. The Good: (In I Ethic., I, 2, 30)

1. "the good of one person"

2. common good:

"the good of the whole political community";

"the preservation of the family."

III. Common Good: (In I Ethic., I, 7, 95. Analogy with reference to an end.)

1. "Prior: Preservation of the political community" (end).

2. "Posterior: related to what is owing to the end" (bona communia: means).

IV. Common Good: (In I Ethic., I, 7, 95. Analogy of proportionality: one proportion to diverse subjects.)

1. "The good of the whole political community".

2. "Preservation of the family".

Among the diverse meanings of 'common good' which have just been mentioned, is there pure equivocation a casu, or is there a common reference despite the diversity of these meanings? 'Common good' designates first and foremost the common good as the final cause of a whole, as a common end. Bona communia belong undoubtedly to the common good of political society as means or instruments. There remains the common good according to predication: not the common good of a whole, but the good common to several people to whom it is attributed, and which designates their private good. The common good according to predication, which is the good common to several people, is opposed to the common good according to causality, which is the common good of a whole and of its parts, without ever being a private good. Aquinas always opposes the common good by way of a genus to the common good as a common end. There is frequent confusion between the two. But we cannot speak here of equivocation *a*  casu. If there is an analogy, it is an analogy of proportionality:

the good predicated of several subjects is, in each one of them, capable of being desired, just as the common good in causando is also, and in an eminent way, capable of being desired. But taken in the abstract, the common good in praedicando is not capable of being desired, and it is not a good.

In the Disputed Questions on Truth, Aquinas distinguishes two meanings of 'common' without relating them to each other:

> For something is said to be common in two ways: In the first way by effect or predication; when, that is, some one thing is found in many according to one explanation: ... In another way by the mode of a cause, just as a cause which, remaining one in number, extends to several effects. I

Uno modo per consecutionem vel praedicationem; quando, scilicet, aliquod unum invenitur in multis secundum unam rationem: . . . Alio modo per

*As* far as legal justice is concerned, Aquinas uses the two notions of community by distinguishing them. Legal justice is a special virtue if it is considered from the point of view of its object: the common good. It is a general virtue to the extent that it is identified with the virtues of which it commands the acts.

# VI

In conclusion, the difference between Aristotle's analysis of the common advantage and Thomas Aquinas' analysis of the common good is based on two different worldviews. For Aristotle, the communal aspect of human life does not transcend the temporal realm, nor does it transcend the citizens of a particular· city. The common good is the perfect and self-sufficient good in its own order. Aristotle considers God as a Good, as that which is supremely lovable, the end of the cosmos and an extrinsic end. He does not, however, have any notion of God as the end of the supernatural order or as the common good of that order.

In Aquinas' writings, we see a broadening of the hierarchy of communities, in that the communal aspect of human life is extended to include the communion of all people under God. If there were not this latter communion, Aquinas would not have called God the common good of all His creatures. It is in this perspective that we find the distinctions among the various kinds of common goods. The political common good in Aquinas' writings, which is the same thing as the common advantage in the writings of Aristotle, is to be found in the realm of intrinsic common goods in causando. This good is identical to the order of the political community, an order of justice and friendship. The order of the political community is a final cause, a whole of which each citizen can

modum causae, sicut causa quae, una numero manens, ad plures effectus se extendit; ... " [The emphasis is that of Aquinas.]

have a part; each member of the political community has his or

her role to play so that this order can be realized. For Aquinas as well as for Aristotle, the possibility of enjoying the advantages of life in common is based on citizenship. It is true that for these two authors a human being is not automatically a citizen. For Aquinas, however, the fact that every human being is a creature of God implies that he or she is a member of a community which transcends the political community. There is thus a distinction between human dignity and citizenship. The value of a human being does not derive solely from his or her involvement in the political community. But this view is limited by the fact that it does not link membership in a community which transcends the temporal city on the one hand, and temporal citizenship on the other hand. There is nothing in Aquinas' position which necessitates such a link, but there is· nothing which excludes this possibility either.

In order to answer the question of the relationship between the common good and the good of each citizen, we must go much farther than Aquinas did, to the point of affirming that as a person, each individual must automatically be recognized as a citizen de facto of a political community, with all the rights which flow from this status. What is more, we cannot reconcile, in a given context, the political common good and the good of each citizen if the common good is purely abstract~ A thing does not deserve to be called a common good unless it is also *my* good, and the good of each and every one of my fellow citizens. But the 'Common good is not fixed once and for all. It involves different concrete goods in different places, and at different times in history. The only way of determining what is precisely the political common good in a given time and place, is to deliberate and decide upon it in open debate.

# CHAPTER FOUR THE PRIMACY OF THE COMMON GOOD OVER PRIVATE GOODS: THE DE KONINCK-ESCHMANN CONTROVERSY

The one who seeks the common good of the multitude seeks also, as a consequence, his or her own good.

Thomas Aquinas *ST,* Ila Ilae, 47, 10, ad 2

#### Introduction

In 1943, Charles De Koninck, who was at that time Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy at Laval University, published a work whose title translates as "On the Primacy of the Common Good against the Personalists. The Principle of the New Order." The three words "against the Personalists" (contre les personnalistes) caused him perhaps more trouble than anything contained in the book itself. De Koninck most likely sought to criticize a philosophical position while drawing attention away from the identity and reputation of those who might have held that position. The effect was the exact opposite, and was perhaps even more unfortunate than what might have happened if De Koninck had named his opponents. While many philosophers and social thinkers attributed the name 'Personalist' to themselves, the best known and most respected Personalist at the time was jacques Maritain. Readers of De Koninck's book speculated as to whether the

work was aimed at Maritain.l In response, I. Th. Eschmann, O.P., published an article criticizing several aspects of De la primaute du bien commun, and called it "In Defense of jacques Maritain". This merely added to the confusion because.' as it turned out, Eschmann was defending Maritain's reputation and not his ideas. It is beyond doubt that Maritains's ideas are not those criticized in De la primaute du bien commun.2 In La personne et le bien commun, Maritain himself has the last word. After quoting a passage from Eschmann's article, he writes:

> I thank the author of these lines for taking my defense in a debate which was quite lively in Canada and the United States. In this debate, it had curiously happened that in criticizing ideas which are not mine, people had nonetheless led others to believe that I was being indirectly targeted, even when they took care not to mention my name. I should like to hope that this present essay, all the while correcting certain excessive formulas which I myself did not use, will put an end to the misunderstandings and confusion due to the original vice of such a controversy}

Isee, for example, jacques Baisnee, "Two Catholic Critiques of Personalism" The Modem Schoolman 22 (1945), pp. 59-75.

<sup>2</sup>This is obvious even from Maritain's earlier works. See, for example, *Primaute du spirituel,* (Paris: Plon, 1927), p. 12: "According to different formal aspects, each of our actions can be referred at the same time to our own particular good or that of others as private persons, to the common good of the family or that of the political community, and to the transcendent Common Good of the whole universe, i.e., to God himself." ("Suivant des aspects formels differents, chacun de nos actes peut etre refere a la fois au bien particulier de nous-meme ou d'autrui comme personne privee, au bien commun de la famille ou a celui de la cite, et au Bien commun transcendant de tout l'univers, c'est-a-dire aDieu lui-meme.")

# The substance of Charles De Koninck's position

In a book review on Charles DeKoninck's De la primaute du bien commun contre Ies personnalistes Le principe de l'ordre nouveau, Yves Simon gives qualified praise to De Koninck's work, and he outlines the threads of the tangled web in which De Koninck got caught by not naming his opponents. Simon adds: "Insofar as De Koninck's essay vindicates the primacy of the~ommon good and carries out the criticism of definite positlons, it is entirely praiseworthy."! My aim is to approach the debate between De Koninck and Eschmann from that angle. Abstracting from the polemical aspect of the debate, I intend to look for whatever truth can be discovered as a result of this controversy. I believe that the debate, all the while generating considerable heat, has also shed light on an issue as fascinating as it is complex.

In order to understand the position which De Koninck formulates in De la primaute du bien commun, it is necessary straightaway to rule out any notion of the issue's being a choice between the dignity of the human person on the one hand, and the common good on the other hand. It is not as though some scholars were championing the one while a rival group was championing the other. All parties sought to come to the defense of human dignity. The question, however, is: What is it that exalts human dignity most of all? Is it the good shared commonly by all, or is it the good unique to each? In formulating the question, De Koninck states that in order to defend the dignity of human persons and the common good, we must be clear about what we mean by both. It is not enough to claim to exalt the dignity of the human person and to leave it

usage, mettra fin aux malentendus et aux confusions dus au vice originel d'une telle controverse."

lYves Simon,-"On the Common Good" *The Review* of *Politics* 6 (1944), p. 533.

at that.I A central point of De Koninck's thesis is that our dignity does not exist without our being linked to other people and especially to God. Our liberty does not consist in breaking us away from these bonds, but in freeing us so that these bonds can be strengthened.

De Koninck balances this stance by insisting that it is not enough, either, to claim to exalt the primacy of the common good without being specific as to what this involves. Every totalitarian system has put people into servitude precisely by exalting its own perverted notion of the common good. The common good, as De Koninck describes it, is the antithesis of totalitarianism. He sums up the main question as follows: When you exalt the common good, what are you trying to exalt? The rest of De *la primaute* is an attempt to answer that question. The issue is central to De Koninck's thesis, for he sees the primacy of the common good as inseparable from the dignity of human persons: so much s6, that he posits a direct link between the negation of this primacy and the negation of human dignity itself.

When De Koninck speaks of "the good", he means the good as a final cause, that which all things seek as their end, as their perfection. This is to be distinguished from the good as a transcendental, the good as convertible with a being, any being. What makes the good as final cause different from other goods is that it is diffusive of itself) A cause, by definition, extends to at least one effect. And the higher the cause, the greater the number of effects to which it extends. Now the common good, as final cause, is higher than a private good within the same order, in that it extends to several effects. The common good is therefore the highest good of the individual, even higher than the individual's private good.

lcharles De. Koninck, De la primaute du bien commun contre les personnalistes. Le principe de l'ordre nouveau, (Quebec: Editions de l'Universite Laval, 1943), p. 3. 2 Ibid., p. 8.

To avoid confusion, it is necessary to distinguish clearly between the various goods which each can call his or her own (bonum suum, as Aquinas puts it, or "one's own good"). The first type of bonum suum is the share which the individual has in the common good. The common good, as final causel, is a whole of which, by participation, each person has a part. It is the bonum suum of each person, and is also the highest perfection of each person. It is the "ours" which is at the same time "mine" and "yours". This is to be distinguished from what is variously called a personal, singular, or private good, which is the good of the individual only, and which cannot be shared with others. Throughout this chapter, I shall endeavor to use the expression 'private good' rather than its variants because 'private good' conveys better than the other expressions the sense of "one's own good and no one else's". There are thus two kinds of bonum suum: a particular share in the common good (my good and that of others) and a private good (my good alone). It is necessary to prevent the misconception that 'common' means "belonging to everyone in general but to no one in particular". On such a view, the common good would be a bonum alienum: either the private good of someone else; or an aggregate of private goods, none of which is mine. On the contrary, to affirm the primacy of the common good is to say that my good which I share with others is more important than my good which I cannot share.

In one of the central texts upon which his thesis depends, DeKoninck quotes from the Summa contra gentiles, in which Aquinas draws out several levels of bona sua:

> The bonum suum of anything can be understood in several ways:

lWhile analyzing De Koninck's position, and unless otherwise indicated, I shall take the expression 'common good' to mean "common good *in* causando" (as described in the preceding chapter). This is the sense in which De Koninck uses the expression when he speaks of the primacy of the common good.

1. In that it is proper to that thing as an individual. And thus an animal desires its good in that it desires food, by which it is preserved in being.

2. In that it is [its good] as species. And thus an animal desires its proper good inasmuch as it desires the generation and feeding.of offspring, or anything else it does to preserve and defend the individuals of its species.

3. As genus. And thus an analogous agent desires its proper good by way of causation; for example, the sky [i.e., the order of the universe. Aquinas held the view that the movement of the heavenly bodies is the instrumental cause of the movement of earthly bodies. Cf. beginning of same chapter ofSCG].

4. As a similarity of analogy of effects to their principle. And thus God, who is outside any genus, gives being to all things for the sake of his own good. I

The proper good of a thing as individual, which is the lowest level of good, is also that which is closest to the individual. It is the most easily identifiable and knowable. The more perfect the creature, the more common the good that creature is capable of knowing. The problem is that the more common the good, the more difficult it is to determine and pursue. As I£ Koninck explains at another point in his text,2 there are at least tWo levels of good which human persons seek as their end: the good of sense(i.e., the five senses), and the good of intelligence,

Tertio vero modo, *ratione generis* Et sic appetit proprium bonum in causando agens aequivocum: sicut caelum.

<sup>1 &</sup>quot;Bonum suum cujuslibet rei potest accipi multipliciter.

Uno quidem modo, secundum quod est ejus proprium *ratione individui.* Et sic appetit animal suum bonum cum appetit cibum, quo in esse conservatur.

<sup>·</sup> Alio modo, secundum quod est ejus *ratione speciei.* Et sic appetit proprium bonum animal inquantum appetit generationem prolis et ejus nutritionem, vel quicquid aliud operetur ad conservationem vel defensionem individuorum suae speciei.

that good which we can pursue only by exerCismg our intelligence. There is a contrariety in us: on the one hand, our sensory nature inclines us toward our sensory and private good; on the other hand, our intelligence inclines us toward a good which extends to many individual subjects. In order to attain this common good, however, we must make use of our sense faculties, which De Koninck calls a principle in this respect. If the cardinal virtues are not developed, the person will pursue his or her sensory, private good, and the pursuit of the common good will be frustrated. The contrariety within us is what De Koninck sees as a locus of freedom, the exercise of which involves subordinating our lower, private good to our higher, common good.

This freedom is explained by the fact that unlike brute animals, human persons are capable of acting knowingly for the sake of their good on every IeveLl Non-rational creatures are capable of acting knowingly only for the lower kinds of good (their good as individuals and as members of a species). By tending toward these lower goods, they thereby pursue their higher goods without knowing it. The problem for us humans is that since our knowledge extends also to other levels of the common good, we are capable of preferring either our common good or our private good, depending on which one appears to us as a higher good. If we were not capable of such a· choice, then the possibility of preferring our private good would not enter into the picture. The knowing pursuit of the common good is a function of our rationality. Being within the realm offree choice, it is a principle of ethical decision-making.

There is need to nuance De Koninck's contention that a private good is a sensory good. Whether or not this is the case depends on whether the individual being in question is of a rational nature. For human persons, the pursuit of our good as individuals and as a species involves not only the use of our senses but also the use of reason. And, as De Koninck rightly

*lJbid.,* p.lO.

puts it, the knowing pursuit of our generic and analogical good, to which intelligence is indispensable, has sense-knowledge as its principle. The distinction between sensation and intelligence lies, not in the order of goods, but in the order of beings which tend to these goods as their perfection.!

There must not be too strong an emphasis placed on the notion that the common good is also a proper good, one's highest proper good. For there are two ways. of loving or desiring the common good.Z The perverse way of desiring the common good is in order to have it and possess it for oneself. In such an instance, I love the common good, not because I share it with others, but because it is mine, and because I want it to be all mine. That is how a tyrant desires the good of the political community. Tyrants desire the good of the political community precisely so that it can be taken from the community and appropriated to the tyrant. The community, as well as each of its members, is treated as though it were the private property -- the private good -- of the tyrant. The second way of desiring the common good is so that it can be promoted and preserved. In other words, good leaders desire the good of the community because they share it with others, and because they want it to be shared as much as possible with as many people as possible. When faced with a choice between their private good and the common good, they will choose to promote and preserve the common good. Another way of

2De Koninck, *De la primaute,* p. 18.

<sup>1</sup> For Aquinas, the distinction between sense and intellect is based on the origin of knowledge, whether particular or universal. The point is that desire follows upon knowledge. "(I)n us, private love arises out of sense-knowlege, but love of the common and absolute good arises out of intellectual knowledge." *(De spir. creat.,* 8, ad 5. Quoted by De Koninck in *De la primaute,* p. 15.) "(I)n nobis privata dilectio ex cognitione sensitiva exoritur; dilectio vero communis et absoluti boni ex cognitione intellectiva."

Desire has knowledge as its principle. The fact, however, that love of our private good arises out of sense-knowledge does not exclude the use of reason in the pursuit even of our lower goods. Our sensory and intellectual faculties, though distinct from each other, are not separate in reality.

expressing the distinction between the two kinds of desire of the common good, is to speak of serving the common good as opposed to pressing the common good into service of oneself.

The expression 'proper good', which is the same as 'bonum suum' and which i~ not to be confused with 'private good', is quite ambiguous. Aquinas writes:

> 'The proper good of a man' must be taken in diverse ways, to the extent that 'man' is taken in -diverse ways. For, the proper good of a man inasmuch as he is man, is the good of reason, in that, for man, to be is to be rational. But the good of a man to the extent that he is an artisan, is the good of art; and so also to the extent that he is a political being, his good is the good of the political community)

The good of a human person as human person is not the same thing as the good of a person as member of a family. The latter good is more common than the former. The good of a person as member of a family is not the same thing as the good of a person as member of a political community. We are dealing, once again, with an ascending order of goods, the higher goods being more common than the lower. Finally-- and this is a point which divides De Koninck and his critics\ -- the -supernatural good of a person in beatitude is the highest in this order of goods, and is therefore the most common of all. This view is in contrast to that of I. Th. Eschmann, O.P., who holds that our highest good is outside of this order of goods, and that we do not love God principally as our common good. More will be said about this in the sections dealing with Eschmann's criticisms.

<sup>1</sup> De car, 2, c., quoted by De Koninck ibid., p. 20. "Proprium autem bonum hominis oportet diversimode accipi, secundum quod homo diversimode accipitur. Nam, proprium bonum hominis inquantum homo, est bonum rationis, eo quod homini esse est rationale esse. Bonum autem hominis secundum quod est artifex, est bonum artis; et sic etiam secundum quod est politicus, est bonum ejus bonum commune civitatis."

If DeJa primaute is not directed against the ideas of jacques Maritain, there is nevertheless one point on which ~ Koninck's position differs considerably from that of Maritain. Whereas Maritain holds that human dignity is explained by the fact that human persons are wholes, De Koninck is of the opinion that our dignity is to be found in our being a part of something larger than ourselves: '

It is ... as a part of a whole that we are ordered to the highest of all goods which cannot be more our own than in its communicability to others .... Even the love of the proper good of the singular person cannot be subtracted from the love of the common good.l

The principal idea here is that a private good is commensurable with the singular person who loves that good. Now, there is no way ·that the higher kinds of good, whic~ diffuse themselves to several persons, can be commensurable with one person alone. It follows, therefore, that our private good is by no means our highest good. On De Koninck's view, the affirmation that a human person is a whole implies that the highest good of that person is a good commensurable with that person. Consequently, the affirmation that a human person is a· part of *a:* whole implies that the highest good of that person is the good of the whole of which the person is a part. That is why De Koninck is inclined to see human dignity more in our being part than in our being whole. I do not wish to decide the matter here and now, but there are a couple of considerations which shed light on this issue. If the above quote is not to be misunderstood, we must specify that there are at least two kinds of wholes: organic wholes (such as human persons) and ordered wholes (such as communities of persons, as well as the order of the universe). Various parts of an ordered whole can

lDe *la-primaute;* p. 25. "C'est done bien en tant qu'une partie d'un tout que nous sommes ordonnes au plus grand de tous les biens qui ne peut etre le plus notre que dans sa communicabilite aux autres. . . . Meme l'amour du bien propre de la personne singuliere ne peut etre soustrait a l'amour du bien common ...

have their own act of existence. It is possible, in other words, for an ordered whole to include organic wholes. Each (ordered) part can also be an (organic) whole. The wholeness of a family, of a political community, and of the order of the universe are, in each case, analogical wholeness, of which the first analogue is the wholeness of an individual substance. This leaves room for two explanations of human dignity: one from the point of view of each person's nature, and the other from the point of view of human persons' finality. There is need for both explanations. Maritain emphasizes the former, DeKoninck the latter.

It has already been mentioned that our highest common good is God. Another distinction is in order.l God, as our highest good, is our *uncreated* common good, but our highest *created* common good is the order of the universe. The fact that this good is common does not make it any less a bonum suum, but rather it is more completely a bonum suum than is a private good, in that this common good is so superabundant that it can diffuse itself among the totality of created individuals without being depleted. The order of the universe, as the highest created common good and therefore the highest created good of each individual, is what is principally created and willed by God. This view is in contrast to the idea that it is human persons who are principally created and willed by God. The latter view, which will be one of the main criticisms of~ Koninck's thesis, aims to avoid putting the universe between God and the human person. In response to this criticism, ~ Koninck will set out to show that the order of the universe, as the highest created good of each person, is subordinate to each person's uncreated good (God), and is therefore not a barrier between the person and God, but rather a path by which we attain to God.

For it is not as though each person were a part of the universe *in the same way* as non.:rational substances are part

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 31.

of the universe. Within the order of the universe, .each rational creature relates to God in a way which non-rational creatures cannot. De Koninck writes:

> Rational creatures can attain, by themselves in an explicit way, the good to which all things are ordered; in this they differ from non-rational creatures, which are pure instruments, which are useful only and which do not attain, by themselves in an explicit way, the universal good to which they are ordered. And in that consists the dignity of rational nature)

Go:l, as the highest good of the universe and the highest good of each individual, is knowable to rational creatures. Unlike non-rational creatures, we are capable of understanding something of the order of which we are a part. As Aquinas puts it:

> It is obvious that all parts are ordered to the perfection of the whole: for· the whole is not for the sake of the parts, but the parts are for the sake of the whole. But intellectual natures have a greater affinity to the whole than other natures do. For, every intellectual substance is in some way all things, inasmuch as it is capable, by its intellect, of grasping the whole of being. But every other substance partakes only of what is particular to being;Z

lJbid., p. 3s. "Les creatures raisonnables peuvent atteindre ellesmemes de maniere explicite le bien auquel toutes chases sont ordonnees; elles different par la des creatures irraisonnables, qui sont de purs instruments, qui sont utiles seulement et qui n'atteignent pas elles-memes de maniere explicite le bien universe! auquel elles sont ordonnees. Et c'est en cela que consiste la dignite de la nature raisonnable."

<sup>2</sup>scc, III, 112. "Manifestum est partes omnes ordinari ad perfectionem totius: non enim est tatum propter partes, sed partes propter tatum sunt. Naturae autem intellectuales maiorem habent affinitatem ad tatum quam aliae naturae: nam unaquaequae intellectualis substantia est quodammodo omnia, inquantum totius entis comprehensiva est suo intellectu: quaelibet autem alia substantia particularem solam entis participationem habet."

For these reasons, then, we are part of the universe in a way different from that of non-rational creatures. By being capable of having at least some knowledge of the highest good of the universe, and by being capable of understanding something of how the universe is ordered, we bear some likeness to the whole, all the while remaining a part.

#### Some further specifications

In the previous section, there was mention of the distinction between human persons' dignity of nature and our dignity of finality. De Koninck spells this out in some detail by borrowing upon Aquinas' explanation of this matter.! 'Dignity of nature', or 'the perfection of our nature' means that we are masters of our own actions. The original meaning of agere (to act) is literally "to push". By our rational nature, we are able to "push" ourselves, to choose freely the means to achieve our end, and thereby to move ourselves toward that end. We are capable, in other words, of deliberation and decision. The incompleteness of this picture of human dignity is apparent in that deliberation and decision concern only the means to an end; they say nothing about the end for which the means are chosen, an end which does not fall within the pale of deliberation. The question, "What is this end?" is answered by the dignity of finality. By our dignity of finality, we are able to attain to the ultimate end of the universe: to know and love God. All this is in contrast to non-rational creatures, which tend to this same end unknowingly and in a ·determined way, and which therefore do not and cannot deliberate as to the means to this end. They seek this end by instinct.

In this. analysis of the dignity of finality, there is a potential difficulty in that both Aquinas and De Koninck hold that non-rational creatures exist for the sake of rational creatures; or, as De Koninck puts it, they are "useful only".

There is no doubt that we can rightly make use of other animals for food, clothing and, when necessary, beasts of burden. This point also clearly distinguishes between use and abuse; between having animals serve our ends on the one hand, and cruelty to animals on the other hand. The problem is with the ambiguity of positing human persons as ends with regard to other animals. This latter point leaves open the possibility of mistakenly taking human persons . as ends *with regard to themselves.* De Koninck emphasizes that human persons exist for ends beyond themselves: for the order of the universe and, ultimately, for the knowledge and love of God. Our dignity of nature exists also for this fmality. One problem, as De Koninck points out 1, is that since we are capable of either cho~sing or casting aside the means of achieving our ultimate end, it is possible for us to fall from our dignity. There is need for some nuance here. Our dignity of nature remains a constant. just as the root of the word *'natura'* is *'nasci',* "to be born", this dignity ls something innate; it cannot be lost by any misadventure. We can, however, fail to realize the dispositions which are in our nature: namely, to live a moral life in common with others, and to attain to God, the highest common good of the universe and the highest good of each of us. To put it another way, we cannot lose our ontological dignity, but in our moral life we can live in ways which are unworthy of that dignity, and which frustrate the realization of our dignity of finality.

This raises the question of the relationship between our dignity of nature and our dignity of finality. We could see the two of them as being related to each other as point of departure and point of arrival (principle and term). We come into being with our dignity of nature, which is ours ontologically. But this dignity is ours *so that* we can attain the end for which we exist in the first place. To miss the mark, to fail to reach this end, is to leave the major part of our dignity

<sup>1</sup> Ibid., p. 39.

unrealized. To attain this end, however, is to reach the term of what is already there in potentiality. Human action, exercised with deliberation and decision, is the movement from principle to term.

We could compare this relationship of dignity of nature to dignity of fmality, to the relationship of the person as whole to the person as part of a larger whole. De Koninck emphasizes our dignity of finality, and views it as the final cause of our dignity, and therefore our dignity's first cause on the level of intention. As a consequence, and unlike jacques Maritain, he emphasizes the importance of our being part of a larger whole.! The good to which we tend is a participated good. It can in no way be commensurable with any one human person.z It is necessarily larger than ourselves, and is shared among many persons, and indeed with all of creation. De Koninck emphasizes the person's being a part because the good to which we tend, and of which each of us has a part, is a greater good than the good which belongs to one person alone by virtue of his or her wholeness. It is true, at the same time, that we would not be capable of attaining, by ourselves, this universal common good if we were not, each of us, an organic whole and a rational substance. The relationship of the person as organic whole to the person as ordered part is not one of contrariety; it is, rather, a relationship of principle to term.

In connection with this, we might recall the passage from the Summa theologiae, quoted in Chapter One of this thesis, which states that the good of grace of one person is , greater than the good of nature of the whole universe.3 ~ Koninck formulates and answers an objection based on this passage.4 The objection has it that the intrinsic common good of the universe envisaged in its nature is subordinate to the good of the singular person. De Koninck responds that the

- 3sr, Ia Ilae, 103, 9, ad 2.
<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.* , p. 50.

<sup>2&</sup>quot;0therwise, every person would be God." *Ibid.* , p. 140.

<sup>4</sup>De *la primaute,* p. 63.

comparison between the goocl of grace of one person on the one hand, and the good of nature of the universe on the other hand, is a comparison which cuts across genera. It is a comparison of goods within two different orders. The primacy of the common goocl, on the contrary, affirms the primacy of the common good over private goods *within the same order.* If a private good of a higher order (such as grace) has primacy over a common good of a lower order (such as nature), it does so by accident. It remains the case that any private good of nature is subordinate to any common good of nature, and any private good of grace is subordinate to any common good of grace. The good of grace of one person is indeed greater than the good of nature of the whole universe, but it does not follow that any private good is greater than a common good of the same order. Nor is it the case, as the response to this objection makes clear, that every common good of whichever order has primacy over every private good of whichever order.

De Koninck responds also to the quote from the Summa, phrased in the form of an objection, that man is not ordered to political society according to his whole self and according to everything that is his.l De Koninck, of course, agrees with this statement. He disagrees, however, with any interpretation which would have it that the private good of human persons is of a higher order than the common good of the political community. When Aquinas states that we are not ordered to political society according to our whole selves and according to everything that is ours, he means that we are also ordered to other societies, such as the family and the Communion of Saints. We are ordered to the political community inasmuch as we are citizens of that community. 'A person as a human being', 'a person as member of a family', and 'a person as member of the· political community' refer to the same individual but according to different formalities.

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.* , pp. 66f. See *ST,* Ia Ilae, 21, 4, ad 3.

·Totalitarianism views the person-as-citizen as the only real formality, and as the formality which embraces all the others.

None of what has been said should be taken to mean that a private good is unworthy of respect, or that it should not be safeguarded.! In fact, a State which does not respect people's private good and the good of families, is not respecting the common good either. It is for the common good that private goods are given the place which is theirs .. The primacy of the common good affirms, rather, that common goods are preferred to those that are private. Private goods, however necessary they are to life, are subordinate to the common good.

There is a potential area of· difficulty in the interpretation of De Koninck's thesis on the primacy of the common good. The difficulty lies in the fact that, for so many of our contemporaries, anything which does not refer specifically to the governing of the political community is called "private". The word 'private' is used not only to designate the life, health, and property of the individual, but also family life, the activities of other intermediate groups, and the life of religious groups as well. In other words, 'private' has come to designate all levels of common goods except that of the political community. In such a context, a defense of the primacy of the common good over private goods could easily be misinterpreted as a defense of the primacy of the "political" over everything else. It should be obvious by now that this is not what De Koninck means. So much of what is often called "private" is what De Koninck identifies as the good of a person as member of other communities.

## Eschmann's critique (1)

I. Th. Eschmann's critique of De la primaute du bien commun is not a thoroughgoing criticism of every aspect of ~ Koninck's thesis. For example, nowhere does Eschmann suggest

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.* , p. 70.

that, in the political realm, private goods have primacy over the common good of the political community. In fact, Eschmann does not make mention of most ofwhat is written in De *la primaute,* and one can assume that his silence implies consent. Instead, Eschmann's critique is confined to a number of specific points. Chief among them is his criticism of the notion that God is primarily our common good.

I have divided the debate into three sections, representing three broad areas of criticism. After each section, I shall discuss De Koninck's rebuttal of this criticism. My intention is not to dwell on every point of the debate, but only ort the issues which are of properly philosophical interest, and only on the more important issues in the debate.

In the article, "In Defense of jacques Maritain", Eschmann first objects to De Koninck's claim that human persons are created for the order of the universe. More specifically, he interprets the expression 'materially constituting parts of the universe' as 'material parts of the universe') What bothers Eschmann is Eschmann's interpretation to the effect that it is not enough to be created for God as one'S highest good, but that one must also be considered as a "material" part of the universe. I shall explain what Eschmann means by 'material part', and why he finds the notion abhorrent. I shall then discuss De Koninck's response in the next section.

Eschmann seems to be reading materialism in to ~ Kortinck's thesis:

> It must be stressed, indeed -- such is [De Koninck's] thesis -- that persons are subordinated to the intrinsic common good of the universe; i.e., its order. And they are thus subordinated because they are material parts materially composing and materially constituting that order and common good.2

li. Th. Eschmann, O.P. "In Defense of Jacques Maritain" The Modern Schoolman XXII (1945), p. 187. 2Jbid.

The word 'material', in this context, is ambiguous; it leaves room for misunderstanding, as though being ordered to the intrinsic common good of the universe were a function of the materiality of persons rather than of their being natural beings. It is important, here, not to confuse the spiritual in us with the supernatural) There is much in the order of nature which is spiritual, such as the life of the intellect and will, as well as the immortality of the soul. Grace and nature interpenetrate each other, but they are nonetheless distinct; they are not the same thing. We are part of the order of the universe by virtue of our being natural beings. But what kind of part are we?

Eschmann emphasizes that human persons are principal parts of the universe. On his view, our being principal parts is accounted for by our spiritual nature, and it rules out the possibility of our being considered material parts:

> The intellectual creatures, St. Thomas says, are governed for themselves. How, then, can they still be a material part of the cosmos? How can it still be true that God's intention, in the creation of such beings, is "nothing but the order of the universe"?2

To be a material part, on Eschmann's view, means to be a part which is material only; it does not mean, strictly speaking, to constitute materially a part; to be, ~ith other creatures, that out of which the universe is made. For Eschmann, spiritual or even composite beings cannot be considered material parts of the universe. If they were, then human persons, for example, would "have just as much responsibility, just as much choice, as the pistons in a steam engine."3 The point of Eschmann's criticism is to state that it is contradictory to hold, on the one

lsee Louis Lachance, 0. P., L'Humanisme politique de saint Thomas. (Ottawa: Editions du Levrier, 1939), pp. 464f.

<sup>2&</sup>quot;In Defense-of Jacques Maritain", p. 189. 3Jbid.

hand, that human persons can attain, by themselves in an explicit way, the good to which all things are ordered; and to hold, on the other hand, that human persons materially constitute the universe.

#### De Koninck's response (1)

First of all, we must be aware of the common ground in the positions of Eschmann and De Koninck. Both hold that God is the supreme, extrinsic good of the universe. Both hold, also, that God is a common good, although we shall see that when they use the expression 'common good' in reference to God, they do not mean the same thing. They both hold that the ordE7r of the universe is an intrinsic common good, but their difference in interpretation of God's being the common good, will cause them to differ considerably over the relationship between human persons and the order of the universe as well.

In the article, "In Defence of St. Thomas: A Reply to Father Eschmann's Attack on the Primacy otf the Common Good", De Koninck makes it clear that human persons are ultimately ordered only to God, the extrinsic common good (in causando) of all creation)~ Within the universe itself, however, human persons are ordered supremely to the order of the universe, which is the universe's intrinsic common good. We are not ordered absolutely to this intrinsic common good. We are principal parts materially constituting the universe. In explaining what this means, De Koninck states that a part as part, whether principal or secondary, material or formal, corporeal or spiritual, belongs to the genus of material cause. As he points out, Aquinas raises a doubt precisely on this point. The doubt is, in Aquinas' own words,

lchartles D~ Koninck, "In Defence of St. Thomas: A Reply to Father Eschmann's Attack on the Primacy of the Common Good" Laval *theologique et philosophique* I, 2 ( 1945), p. 10.

[whether] parts are material causes of a whole, since above [in Aristotle's Physics], [Aristotle] had reduced the parts of a defmition to formal cause. And it can be said that he was speaking above of parts of species, which fall in the definition of 'whole'. But he is speaking here of the parts of matter, in the definition of which 'whole' falls, just as 'circle' falls in the definition of 'semicircle'. But it is better to say that although parts of species, which are placed in a definition, are compared to a supposit of [a certain] nature by mode of formal cause, nevertheless they are compared as matter to the nature itself, of which they are parts. For all parts are compared to the whole as the imperfect to the perfect. Indeed, this is a comparison of matter to form. (In II Phys., 5, 9)

But it is obvious from those things which are said in the second book [of the Physics] that a whole has the nature of a form, but the parts have the nature of matter. (In III Phys., 12, 2)1

The distinction which Aquinas is making is between a secondary substance (species) as whole, and a primary substance (hypostasis) as whole. A part, any part, is that out of which (id ex quo) something is composed. A species is also, among other things, that out of which a primary substance is composed. Even though it is the form of the individual substance, nevertheless as part of that substance it falls under the genus of material cause. It materially constitutes that

*lJbid.* , p. 10. "de hoc quod dicit, quod partes sunt causae materiales totius, cum supra partes definitionis reduxerit ad causam formalem. Et potest dici quod supra locutus est de partibus speciei, quae cadunt in definitione totius: hie autem loquitur de partibus materiae, in quarum definitione cadit totum, sicut circulus cadit in definitione semicirculi. Sed melius dicendum est quod licet partes speciei quae ponuntur in definitione, comparentur ad suppositum naturae per modum causae formalis, tamen ad ipsam naturam cujus sunt partes comparantur ut materia: *nam omnes partes comparantur ad totum ut imperfectum ad perfectum, quae quidem est comparatio materiae ad formam* . . . . Manifestum est autem ex iis quae dicta sunt in secundo *(Physic.)* quod totum habet rationem formae, *partes autem rationem materiae."*  [Emphasis is that of De Koninck.]

primary substance. To say, by analogy of organic wholes to ordered wholes, that human persons materially constitute the universe is to say that

> ( 1) human persons, body and soul, are part of the universe. Together with other kinds of creatures, we are that out of which the universe is composed.

> (2) the relationship of persons to the universe as part to whole, is a relationship of the imperfect or incomplete, to the perfect or complete.

> (3) the order of the universe, precisely as order, is a form. It is a principle of organization among the various beings, in their genera and species, which compose that order.

In short, the affirmation that we materially constitute the universe is anything but a denial of our spiritual nature (which is part of each of us and therefore part also of the universe), nor is it a denial of human responsibility and choice. Furthermore, only God is outside the universe. God is not part of the universe; that is, he does not relate to the order of the universe as the imperfect to the perfect. He is not one being among beings. Rather, God transcends the universe, all the while being present to the universe as a whole, and to each one of its parts. To place the human person, or any part thereof, outside of the universe is to put the person on the same level as God. This is not to say that the order of the universe stands between us and God, or that the order of the universe is a barrier which must be overcome in order to reach God. Rather, each of us relates to God as an individual, as a member of a particular family, of other intermediate groups, and so on up to the order of the universe. This order is our highest *created*  common good.

The fact that, beyond the order of the universe, there is our uncreated common good, means that the order of the universe is not our ultimate end:

> . . . (I)f some whole is not an ultimate end, but is ordered to a higher end, the ultimate end of a part is not the whole itself, but something else. But the entirety of creatures, to which man is compared as part to whole, is not the ultimate end, but is ordered to God as [its] ultimate end. Therefore the good of the universe is not the ultimate end of man, but God himself [is the ultimate end of man]. (Ia llae, 2, 8, ad 2)1

And that is why we do not have to surmount the order of the universe, or to abstract ourselves from the order of the universe, in order to attain to God. The universe itself is related to God as means to an end. The end of a whole is also the end of each of its parts. God, therefore, as ultimate end of the universe, is also the ultimate end of each individual being -- and a fortiori of rational beings, which are able to know God as their end.

Eschmann's critique expresses some unease about a person's being called a part: a part of society, a part of the universe. We have already seen that while human society and the order of the universe are ordered wholes, the person is an organic whole. De Koninck further spells out the consequences of this distinction insofar as it involves the person's being called a part.2 For the body and soul to be parts of the person means that the unity among these parts is a substantial unity. The person is an unum per se, one being with its own act of existence, and not existing as part of some other unum per se. But neither human society (on any of its levels) nor the order

lJbid., p. 11 (note). "Quod si totum aliquod non sit ultimus finis, sed ordinetur ad finem ulteriorem, ultimus finis partis non est ipsum totum, sed aliquid aliud. Universitas autem creaturarum, ad quam comparatur homo ut pars ad totum, non est ultimus fmis, sed ordinatur in Deum sicut in ultimum finem. Unde bonum universi non est ultimus finis hominis, sed ipse Deus." 2Jbid., p. 16f.

of the universe is an unum per se. The fact that they are ordered wholes implies that the unity among their parts is an accidental unity. Each part remains an individual substance with its own act of existence, and it therefore does not exist by virtue of the ordered whole to which it belongs. The ordered whole, in other words, is not the foundation of its existence, but rather an intermediate end for which it exists. The statement 'A person is not part of anything else' is true if that "anything else" is understood as a substantial unum per se, but it is false if the larger whole is an ordered whole, the parts of which are united per accidens. Simply put, a person is not part of society or of the universe in the same way that the body or is part of a person. Society and the universe are not super-individuals whi~h preclude any separate act of existence on the part of their members.

#### Eschmann's critique (2)

Eschmann's second objection pursues his point of intellectual substances' being principal and formal parts of the universe. A consequence is that intellectual substances are more like God ("in the image of God") than is the universe as a whole.l The exchange between Eschmann and De Koninck centers around~ disagreement over the interpretation of the following passage from the Summa theologiae:

> The universe is more perfect in goodness, extensively and diffusively, than an intellectual creature is. But intensively and collectively, similarity to divine goodness is found more in an intellectual creature, which is capable of the supreme good.

> Or again, a part is not divided against the whole, but against another part. Therefore when it is said that an intellectual·nature alone is in the image of God, this

lit is true t!lat when we speak of something being "in the image of God", we are dealing with an issue specific to theology. I am using this point as an example, for the sake of its philosophical interest.

does not exclude the universe's being in the image of God according to a certain one of its parts. It is other parts of the universe which are excluded. (Ia, 93, 2, ad 3)1

We must be clear about what is meant by 'image'. In the same article of the Summa, there is a passage which distinguishes the various ways in which it is possible to be like God, or similar to God. Being in the image of God is only one of those ways. "Some things are similar to God, first and most commonly, inasmuch as they exist; secondly, inasmuch as they are alive; thirdly, inasmuch as they have wisdom or intelligence."2 The point which Aquinas is illustrating is that there are at least two kinds of similarity: similarity of genus, and similarity of species. It is the latter which is referred to as an image. It is a great~r similarity because it is based on the last degree of difference. In other words, if two individual things are similar by way of species, they are similar by virtue of characteristics which set them apart from other species. But if, say, two things are similar in that they are living things, this does not say much, because their similarity is based on something very comnion. Now, intellectual creatures' similarity to God is greater than other creatures' similarity to God, because their similarity is based on something which they do not share with other creatures, and which, byanalogy, they share with God. That is why the expression 'image of God' is used of intellectual creatures but not of other creatures. To have wisdom and intelligence is to bear the closest

lEschmann, "In Defense of jacques Maritain", p. 190. "Universum est perfectius in bonitate quam intellectuali creatura: extensive et diffusive. Sed intensive et collective similitude divinae perfectionis magis invenitui in intellectuali creatura, quae est capax summi bani. -- Vel dicendum, quod pars non dividitur contra tatum, sed contra aliam partem. Unde cum dicitur quod sola natura intellectualis est ad imaginem Dei, non excluditur quin universum secundum aliquam sui partem sit ad imaginem Dei; sed excluduntur aliae partes universi."

Zsr, la, 93, 2, c. "Assimilantur autem aliqua Deo, prima quidem, et maxime communiter, inquantum sunt; secunda vera, inquantum vivunt; tertia vera, inquantum sapiunt vel intelligunt."

resemblance to God. Therefore, argues Aquinas, intellectual creatures are the only ones which, properly speaking, are in the image of God. If the universe is referred to as the image of God, it is because it contains intellectual creatures as its principal parts.

The main disagreement, in this respect, between Eschmann and De Koninck has to do with the interpretation of 'extensively', 'diffusively', 'intensively', and 'collectively'. Here are Eschmann's interpretations:

> The whole universe is more like God "extensively and diffusively". That is, if you consider God as the cause and fountain-head of the whole universe and of every creature pertaining to it, you will judge that there is quantitatively more likeness in the whole than in the parts ....

> "Intensively" ... and "collectively," i.e. considering the fact that the essentially most perfect likeness is gathered together in one single point, a single intellectual substance by far surpasses everything that might, in a certain sense, be said to be like God. The intellectual substance is, indeed, the only proper image ofGod.l

On Eschmann's view, it is a question here of two ways of looking at God, and not of two ways of looking at creatures. In the first quote, God is seen as cause of the universe. The implied argument is that if a cause extends to several effects, then the multiplicity of effects (the whole) more closely resembles the cause than does any one effect (a part). God is

lEschmann, *op. cit.,* pp. 190f. Etymologically, *'extensive'* means considered as stretched or held out; i.e., from the point of view of the number and kinds of things. *'Diffusive'* means considered as "poured" here and there; i.e., from ·the point of view of the ways in which things are distributed and arranged. *'Intensive'* means considered.as held in; i.e., from the point of view of what is in each individual thing. And *'collective'* means considered as bound together. See the listings for *tendo, fund9,* and *ligo* in A. Ernout et A. Meillet, *Dictionnaire etymologique de la langue latine: Histoire des mots.* ( 4e edition) Paris: Editions Klincksienck, 1985.

the cause of the whole universe, and therefore the multiplicity of creatures, taken together, more closely resembles God as seen from this point of view, than does any one creature, including a rational creature. In the second quote, Eschmann distinguishes between God as cause and God as divine essence. The implied argument, this time, is that any creature which is rational, is more like God as seen from this point of view, than any creature which is not rational. Human persons are rational creatures, and therefore human persons are more like God than are non-rational creatures. ·It is important to note that rational creatures are being compared, not to the universe as a whole, but to other parts of the universe.

For Eschmann, then, the question of whether a rational creature or the order of the universe is more like God, is really a question of how one views God: whether as supreme universal good by the divine essence, or as a common good by virtue of his having created a universe. Against De Koninck, Eschmann holds that we are ordered to God primarily insofar as we resemble God "as He is in Himself', abstracted from whether God created a universe. The reason for which Eschmann insists on a distinction between God-as-Essence and God-as-Cause, is that Eschmann does not hold that we relate to God primarily as parts of the universe. The assumption is that if we relate to God as parts of the universe, then the universe is an obstacle to be surmounted in order to reach God. Now, a rational creature relates directly to God, and therefore, argues Eschmann, a rational creature relates to God on a level which transcends the order of the universe.

#### De Koninck's response (2)

De Koninck does not dispute the notion that, compared to other creatures, intellectual creatures more closely resemble God. In themselves, intensively, they more closely resemble the divine. perfection than do other creatures. De Koninck, however, places the emphasis not on intellectual creatures as considered by intension, nor on the order of the universe, but on the fact that, within that order, there is a multiplicity of different kinds of things. This emphasis is well illustrated by the following passage from the Disputed Questions on the Power of God, which is one of several to which De Koninck refers:

> Either error [i.e., of the Manicheans and of Origen] seems to sidestep the order of the universe in its consideration, considering only the the universe's parts separately. For from the order itself of the universe, the explanation [of that order] could become apparent: [namely,] that from one principle, [with] no difference of merit preceding, diverse ranks of creatures had to be established, so that the universe would be complete. (By many and various modes of creatures, the universe manifests that which already exists in divine goodness simply and indistinctly.) For example, the perfection of a house and of a human body requires a diversity of parts .... So, therefore, from one [thing which came] first, the multitude and diversity of creatures came forth, not on account of the necessity of matter, nor of [any] limitation of [divine] power, nor on account of [divine] goodness, nor of [that] goodness' being bound; but from the order of wisdom, so that the perfection of the universe would consist in the diversity of creatures. (DePot., 3, 16, c.) I

l"In Defence of St. Thomas", p. 27. "Uterque enim error [scil. Manichaeorum et Origenis] ordinem universi praeterire videtur in sua consideratione, considerando tantummodo singulas partes ejus. Ex ipso enim ordine universi potuisset ejus ratio apparere, quod ab uno principia, nulla meritorum diffferentia praecedente, oportuit diversos gradus creaturarum institui, ad hoc quod universum esset completum (repraesentant univ~rso per multiplices et varios modos creaturarum quod in divina bonitate· simpliciter et indistincte praeexistit) sicut et ipsa perfectio domus et humani corporis diversitatem partium requirit . . . . Sic igitur dicendum est, quod ab uno primo muititudo et diversitas creaturarum processit, non propter materiae necessitatem, nee propter potentiae litp.itationem, nee propter bonitatem, nee propter bonitatis obligationem; sed ex ordine sapientiae, ut in diversitate creaturarum perfectio consisteret universi." ·

The first point which must be emphasized is that God did not have to create a universe. Given that he did create a universe, however, there had to be a multiplicity of species so that the divine wisdom could be mirrored as perfectly as possible. If God had created only one kind of thing, then the divine wisdom would be manifest much less perfectly, unless that one species were equal in perfection to God. Now, no intellectual creature is equal in perfection to God. And that is why the perfection of the universe requires the existence of many different kinds of things. The order of the universe, therefore, with its multiplicity of species, is of a higher degree of perfection than any one intellectual creature, or any species of intellectual creatures.

This comparison is true from the standpoint of extension. We run into problems, though, when we look at the comparison from the standpoint of intension. Intensively, every single being is more perfect than any- ordered manifold, because that single being more perfectly imitates divine simplicity.! But on this same rationale, any indivisible part is more perfect than any whole. A subatomic particle, for example, is more perfect than a human body from this point of *view.* Also, the claim that a human person is more perfect than the order of the universe says nothing of the rel<:!.tionship of that person's perfection to that of other persons, either taken individually or together. De Koninck interprets Eschmann's remarks as implying that every singular person, created in the image of God, is more perfect than all other persons, also created in the image of God. This is one possible interpretation, but a less maximal reading of the text would have it that Eschmann is silent as to how the various perfections of singular persons are interrelated. In any case, De Koninck's point is that Eschmann's mention of the intensional perfection of intellectual creatures says less than Eschmann thinks it says. Specifically,

1 *Ibid.,* p. 30.

it is not an argument for intellectual creatures' transcendence of the order of the universe.

De Koninck places the emphasis on the extensional perfection of the universe because this latter perfection has more implications than Eschmann seems to indicate. It is true that the intensional perfection of each singular being is an imitation of divine simplicity. It is also true, however, that the order among the different kinds of things in the universe is also an imitation of that same divine simplicity. What is in God simply and undividedly is in the ordered manifold of the universe in a composite and varied way:

> The divine "simpliciter et unite" is the principle and term of the created "composite et multipliciter" .... (U)ltimately, the Many is but an imitation of the One. The ultimate principle of the unity of the manifold of creation is the identity of the superabundant unity of the divine essence)

If the intensional unity of one thing is an imitation of the divine simplicity, and if the ordered manifold of the universe is also, albeit in an analogous way, an imitation of that same simplicity, then it follows that there is *qualitatively* and not just quantitatively more perfection in the order of the universe than in one thing. The oneness of order includes the perfection of many different kinds of things. It also includes the perfection of their interrelatedness and interdependence. The intensional perfection of a singular being, however, includes the perfection of that being only, and it does not address the relationship of that being to the ordered whole of which it is a part.

To sum up De Koninck's response, then, we could say that the extensional and intensional perfections of the universe are two different ways of looking at *things,* and not two ways of looking at God. The extensional perfection of the universe is

1 *Ibid.,* pp. 30f.

greater than the intensional perfection of any singular being, both because it more perfectly resembles divine simplicity ("God as He is in Himselr'), and because the universe -- the whole and each of its parts -- is ordered to God as its ultimate final cause.

#### Eschmann's critique ( 3)

Finally, this third division of Eschmann's critique concerns the heart of his disagreement with De Koninck: the two authors disagree on the very meaning of the words 'common good'. When Eschmann holds that human persons are ordered primarily to God "as He is in Himselr' and not in that God is our common good, Eschmann is referring to what he calls the common good in essendo, in the act of being. De Koninck, on the other hand, means the common good of many things by causation.

Eschmann maintains that De Koninck has confused the good common to many things in essendo, and the common good of many things in causando. His principal argument is based on the Prima pars, Question 103, Article 4 of the Summa theologiae. The question is: Whether there is only one effect of the governance [of the world] and not several. I shall quote the body of the article, putting in italics the section which Eschmann has quoted:

> The effect of any action can be thought of from the point of view of its end. For, by [the action's] being done, the effect is brought about so that the action can reach its end. But the end of the governance of the world is the essential good, toward whose participation and assimilation all things tend. Therefore the effect of governance can be taken three ways:

> 1. On the part of the end itself. And thus there is one effect of governance; that is, to become like the supreme good.

2. An effect of governance can be considered according to those things by which a creature is led to become like God.

And thus in general there are two effects of governance. But the creature comes to *be* like God in two respects:

2a. In that God is good (insofar as [that] creature is good).

2b. In that God is the cause of goodness for other things (insofar as one creature moves another toward goodness).

Thus there are two effects of governance: the preservation of things in the good, and the movement of those things to the good.

3. The effect of governance can be considered in particular, and for us these effects are innumerable)

Eschmann's criticism is that DeKoninck collapses 2a into 2b. In making this criticism, Eschmann is assuming that 2a and 2b are not only distinct but separate; that is, to be likened to the goodness of God by participated goodness is not, at the same time, to tend to God as one's ultimate end. On Eschmann's view, the only way in which God can be called a common good is in that, accidentally, more than one person is likened to God by participation in his goodness. In the speculative realm, God

l"Respondeo dicendum quod effectus cuiulibet actionis ex fine eius pensari potest: nam per operationem effidtur ut pertingatur ad finem. Finis autem gubernationis mundi est bonum essentiale, ad cuius participationem et assimilationem omnia tendunt. Effectus igitur gubernationis potest accipi tripliciter. Uno modo, ex parte ipsius fmis: et sic est unus effectus gubemationis, scilicet assimilari summo bono. -- Alio modo potest considerari effectus gubemationis secundum ea quibus ad Dei assimilationem creatura perducitur. Et sic in generali sunt duo effectus gubernationis. Creatura enim assimilatur Deo quantum ad duo: scilicet quantum ad id quod Deus bonus est, inquantum creatura est bona; et quantum ad hoc quod Deus est allis causa bonitatis, inquantum una creatura movet aliam ad bonitatem. Unde duo sunt effectus gubernationis: scilicet conservatio rerum in bono, et mo_tio earum ad bonum. -- Tertio modo potest considerari effectus gubernationis in particulari: et sic sunt nobis innumerabiles."

is a common good in essendo. He is a common good *in*  causando only secondarily, in the practical or moral realm.

De Koninck's response ( 3)

According to De Koninck's account of 'private good', it is · a contradiction in terms to affirm, on the one hand, that God is a private good, and to affirm, on the other hand, that this good is shared by many (unless, of course, God were common to many by predication only). Part of the very meaning of 'private good' is that it cannot be shared.! De Koninck maintains that it is the very essence of God to be a final cause of many creatures. The fact that a plurality of creatures does exist is not a necessary truth, but it is necessarily true that the goodness of God is superabundant to the point of diffusing itself to each and every being which he has created. The essence of God is therefore inseparable from his being perfective of all things as their end; his essence IS his being the common good in causando of all. The fact that each one of us is assimilated to God by participation in his goodness must not be taken as separate from our tending toward him as our ultimate final cause.

So that it be made clear that everything which could be said of God is not being collapsed here into his final causality, it must be pointed out that God's final causality is only one way

l"In Defence of St. Thomas", p. 36. At this point in the text, De Koninck uses the expression 'proper good' instead of 'private good'. As we have already seen, 'proper good' is the generic expression, of which 'private good' denotes a species. 'Proper good', in this context, is ambiguous because some proper goods can be shared in common. Indeed, the thesis of De *la primaute du* bien commun is that the common good of all is also the highest proper good of each person. 'Private good' denotes specifically those proper goods which cannot be shared. This is the same terminology as is used in the most ancient Roman expression of the primacy of the common good: "Bonum commune praeferendum est bono privato." ("The common good is to be preferred to a private good.") Cf. I. Th. Eschmann, O.P. "A Thomistic Glossary on the Principle of the Preeminence of a Common Good" Medieval Studies 5 (1943), p. 124.

of viewing God.l God is the ultimate final cause *quoad nos,* for us. And yet, what God is *for us* does not exhaust what God is "in Himself', to borrow Eschmann's expression. Eschmann is correct in making the distinction between these two ways of looking at God; his mistake is to claim that we can be assimilated to God "as He is in Himself' separately from God as He is for us. Furthermore, final causality is not the only causality which God exercises. God is also an efficient cause, the source of all existence, and therefore of all truth and goodness, in everything created. *In this sense,* God is a good - even the supreme good-- common to us by predication, but not a common *end.* Perhaps this is what Eschmann means when he says, in effect, that God is a common good in a restr,cted sense.

De Koninck points out that *'bonum universale in essendo'* (the universal good in the act of being) can actually have three meanings, only one of which pertains exclusively to God:

> Let us now consider the expressions *bonum universale in essendo* and *bonum universale in causando.* The former may bear three distinct meanings: first, it may be taken to mean *bonum universale in praedicando*  which is common to all things insofar as they are good in any way; secondly, it may mean the perfection of divine being considered in itself without formal reference to will; thirdly, it may mean *bonum universale per essentiam,* where the good is considered in the rigorous sense of *'perfectivum alterius per modum finis',* and this is the divine good, for God is good *simpliciter* by His very essence, *'in quantum ejus essentia est suum* esse'."2

In drawing out these distinctions, De Koninck is trying to show that God is both the. supreme good and the common good, perfective of every creature by mode of final causality. When

1 *Ibid.,* p. 49.- 2 *Ibid.,* p. SO. we affirm that God is the universal good, claims De Koninck, we thereby affirm that God is the common good of every creature. If the common good takes precedence over private goods in the same order, and if God is the supreme universal good, then it follows that God is also the common good and not anyone's private good.l

Both meanings apply to God.

N. The universal good in [the act of] being:

1. by predication: common to all things insofar as they are good in any way.

2. perfection of divine being considered in itself without formal reference to will.

3. by essence, perfective of another by mode of an end.

V. The universal good by causation:

1. the divine good according to the strict formality of the good: perfective of another by mode of an end.

2. the divine good as the universal effective and exemplary cause of all created goodness.

On the basis of the distinctions schematized in Table 4.0, De Koninck notes that N, 1 and V, 2 are the same thing, only seen according to different formalities. God's universal, efficient, exemplary causation of all goodness in creatures is common to these creatures by predication; God is the efficient and exemplary cause of goodness, insofar as creatures are good in any way. This observation (that the universal good in *essendo* and the universal good *in causando* are not always separate) situates De Koninck's critique of Eschmann's main argument. De Koninck schematizes Eschmann's argument as follows:

> ( 1) The term of our ordination to God is *bonum universale in essendo.*

> (2) But *bonum universale in essendo* is not *bonum universale in causando.*

(3) Therefore the term of our ordination to God is not bonum universale in causando.l

To this De Koninck answers as follows. Suppose that the universal good *in* essendo means the good by essence,· and the universal good *in* causando means the good as an end. In such a case, it is true that the term of our ordination to God is the universal good in essendo, but it is not true that the universal good in essendo and in causando are not the same thing. Therefore the conclusion, that the term of our ordination to God is not the universal good in causando, is false. But suppose, this time; that the universal good in essendo is taken to mean the perfection of divine being taken by itself; i.e., without reference to its being perfective of another. In this case it is false that the term of our ordination to God is the· universal good in essendo, and 'it is true that the universal good *in*  essendo and in causando are not the same thing. The conclusion, that the term of our ordination to God is not the universal good in causando, is once again false.

De Koninck's main point, then, is that God is more principally our common good by way of final causality, than the good common to us as efficient cause of any goodness in creatures.

#### Conclusion 2

In his discussion of the primacy of the common good, D.:! Koninck's most significant contribution is his contention that the common good and proper goods are not always mutually

<sup>1</sup> Ibid., p. 51.

exclusive. There are many kinds of proper goods: those which we seek in order to preserve our lives as individuals, to preserve the species, to contribute to the well-being of all species, and to live in union with God. Of these various kinds of proper goods, the principal division is between those which we cannot share with others (e.g., anything necessary to the survival of each of us) and those which we can share with others. The latter are our share in the common good: the common good of our families, of the political community, of the human species, and of all things under God.

When we look to the significance of De Koninck's thesis for political philosophy, we see that De Koninck situates political life within a well-ordered and harmonized world~ view. The political community is merely one of those communities to which we are ordered, and political life, like any other aspect of human life, is situated within our relationship to all things and ultimately to God. To live in common with others is part of our nature but, more significantly, it is part of our finality; in other words, political life is an intermediate common good in causando, inseparable from the order of the universe as our ultimate created good, and inseparable from God as our ultimate universal and uncreated common good. De Koninck's thesis is, in short, a revolt against any attempt to compartmentalize human life into public and private, sacred and secular, individual and collective. All these aspects of life are well distinguished from one another, but they are in reality united, their principle of unity being the substantial unity of the human person. Consequently, the person is not put over against society. Rather, there is a comparison of a person's good with the good of society. And the good of society, the political common good, is also the good of each member of that society, and is a higher good that any private good within the political order.

De Koninck's united view of human life is the strong point of his position, but it is also its main weakness, particularly in the debate with I. Th. Eschmann. One gets the impression that there is too quick a jump from the good of the person as individual to the good of the person as member of society. How, for example, does a theory of human rights fit into this view? The primacy of the common good surely leaves a privileged place for both individual and collective rights, but there is curiously no mention of either. Secondly-- and this latter point pertains more specifically to the debate with Eschmann -- there is too quick a jump from the political commongood to the order of the universe, and then to God's final causality. One wonders whether there is room, on this view, for a healthy autonomy of the political order: not autonomy in the sense of politics' being hostile or indifferent to religion, but in the sense of politics' having its own level of competence within its own order.

De Koninck dealt with the theme of human rights later in his career. I intend to pursue the issue in the final chapter of this dissertation.

### PART THREE

# TOWARD A SYNTHESIS

# CHAPTER FIVE CIVIC FRIENDSHIP: THE SINE QUA NON OF THE COMMON GOOD

(A)mong all worldly things there is nothing which seems worthy to be preferred to friendship.

Thomas Aquinas De *Regno* , I, 10.

#### Introduction

What is it that holds a society together and prompts citizens to seek the common good? In the writings of Thomas Aquinas, it is plain that justice, however important, is not enough. Nor does it suffice to enact legislation upon which most citizens can agree. What is needed, in addition to these other things, is political or civic friendship)

It is not my purpose, in this chapter, to discuss all of Aristotle's or Aquinas' teachings on friendship, for to do so would be to travel a well-trod path. I do not intend, either, to relate the various kinds of friendship to the common good.

<sup>1</sup> I prefer the expression 'civic friendship' to 'political friendship' because all friendships are "political" in the sense that the sharing of anything in common is already a beginning of political life. The moral considerations concerning friendship prepare the considerations on the civil good. Cf. *In Vlii Ethic.,* no. 1542.

By 'civic friendship' I mean the friendship existing among fellow citizens of the same political community, or even of different political communities which have federative, diplomatic, or economic ties.

This task has already been carried out by john F. Monagle, in a doctoral dissertation defended at St. Louis University in 1973.1 My purpose is more specific. I intend to concentrate on that kind of friendship which exists among fellow citizens. As we shall see, all friendship is based on what Aquinas calls communicatio. This word is often translated as "communication", but I want to show that it involves the sharing of something. Every friendship exists for the sake of something else, and never merely for itself. In any relationship, people come together as friends on the basis of something shared among them, and fellow citizens are no exception. They come together on the basis of the shared pursuit of the common good. Civic friendship translates as *concprdia* in Latin and concerns persons as such.

This study will confine itself to those writings of Aquinas which describe friendship on the level of nature (as distinct from grace). To treat of Aquinas' elevation of friendship to supernatural charity would take us into the realm of what is known only by Divine Revelation, and must therefore be left to the theologians. It is legitimate to end the discussion on the level of nature, because grace, as Aquinas teaches, destroys nothing of what is there by nature, but rather perfects or completes it.2

### Friendship as rooted in human nature

In the Summa contra gentiles, Aquinas states that friendship is part of the very nature of human beings:

<sup>1</sup> John F. Monagle, *Friendship in Aristotle* and *St. Thomas Aquinas: Its Relationship to the Common* Good, (Unpublished doctoral dissertation, St. Louis University, 1973).

<sup>2</sup>The corollary is that nature, understood in abstraction from grace, is imperfect and incomplete; in other words, it is not the whole of reality, but only part of reality.

For a theological treatment of friendship as charity, see Charles De Koninck, "Le scandale de la mediation" *Laval theologique et philosophique* 15 (1959), especially the section entitled "La Noblesse de l'amitie divine envers le genre humain", pp. 81-84.

Since man is naturallya social animal [I Ethic., VII, 6, 1097b], he needs to be helped by other people in going after his proper end. This is done most suitably by the mutual love existing among people.!

It is worthwhile to note a few points which clarify the intent of this reference. First, 'friendship', in the writings of Aristotle and Aquinas, signifies something broader than what we moderns normally consider as friendship. Usually we think of friendship as a bond of affection between people who are not related to each other. When we hear people refer to "my friend", we take for granted that it means someone outside the family, unless they say something like, "He is my brother but also a good friend." At the same time, we do not usually consider business associates as friends unless we also mingle with them socially. Most of all, it would not occur to most of us to think of· our fellow citizens as friends. The explanation which comes first to mind is that the size of modern States makes civic friendship impossible, but this is not the reason. It has more to do with the relatively restricted sense in which we moderns speak of friendship. For Aristotle and Aquinas, however, 'friendship' refers to everything from the relationship between entrepreneur and client, to.· the relationship between husband and wife. Secondly, in the above passage Aquinas uses the word 'love' (dilectio) instead of 'friendship' (amicitia). Diligere means literally to take delight or plesasure in someone; dilectio is the first act of charity. There is a difference in the way that Aristotle and Aquinas understand love. For Aristotle, love is an excess of friendship -- not necessarily an inordinate excess, for much depends on the person who is loving, and on whether the friendship is for pleasure, for utility, or for the good. 'Excess', in other words,

I .sa;, III, 117. "Cum homo sit naturaliter animal sociale [I Ethic., VII, 6; 1097b], indiget ab alibus hominibus adiuvari ad consequendum proprium finem. Quod convenientissime fit dilectione mutua inter homines existente." (The emphasis is that of Aquinas.)

means "very much" but not necessarily "too much". In Aquinas' writings, however, love or charity is the highest form of friendship, and the love between human beings and God is the standard against which all friendships are measured. It is for this reason that *'diligere'* is used to mean our love for God as well as the love, on any level, which we have for our neighbor. Finally, it is interesting to note, in the same chapter of the *Summa contra gentiles,* that although our disposition toward friendship is posited as part of divine law, the basis of this divine law is our natural disposition to live in common with others.

This disposition causes us to be inclined toward friendship for everyone, including strangers. The sign which Aquinas gives for this is that people are inclined to help anyone, even a stranger, in time of need.I As he writes in the *Summa theologiae:* 

> Everyone is naturally a friend to everyone by a certain general love: just as it is also said in Ecclesiasticus 13:19, that *eve!}' animal loves what is similar to itself.*  And what manifests this love are the signs of friendship which someone shows outwardly, in words or deeds, even to foreigners and strangers.2

It will be important to keep this "general love" in mind when considering civic friendship. The classical understanding of friendship includes many kinds of relationships, including the bond which unites fellow citizens to one another in the same political community, and which unites even more than one political community. We have seen, so far, that there is something in our nature which prompts us to be well disposed toward helping even those whom we do not know personally,

*lJbid.* 

<sup>2</sup>sr Ila Ilae, 114, 1, ad 2. "(O)mnis homo naturaliter omni homini est amicus quodam generali amore: sicut etiam dicitur Eccli. 13, 19, quod *omne animal diligit simile sibi* . Et hunc amorem repraesentant signa amicitiae quae quis exterius ostendit in verbis vel factis etiam extraneis et ignotis."

and it is at least partly for this reason that relatively large groups of people are able to choose to live together in political communities.

People also join together in civic friendship for the sake of a common end or purpose. In the same chapter of the Summa contra gentiles, Aquinas argues that there must be a union of affection among those to whom there is a common end. The common end in which people share (communicant) is happiness or beatitude. Therefore people must be united to one another by mutual love. Aquinas is speaking here of the bond of love, charity, which unites us by divine law in the pursuit of eternal beatitude. Eternal happiness is the highest level of happiness. It presumes the existence of lower levels, one of which is the happiness which people seek in human society: the temporal common good. We have already seen, in Chapter Three, that the political common good is that which enables people not only to live but to live well, to engage in good actions and thereby to live happily. In civic friendship as well as in charity, therefore, people come together in friendship not only on the basis of a common nature but also on the basis of the pursuit of a common end or purpose. There is an analogy at work here: civic friendship is to virtuous living in human society as charity is to eternal beatitude. The political community is not instituted only for life in common, but for virtuous living .I

# The 'communicatio' of the pursuit of the political common good

In commenting on Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, Aquinas writes that true friendship is founded on virtue, as a

lcf. In III Polit., 411. "Friendship is chosen for the sake of life in common, but without life in common there .is no political community. That is why friendship is necessary for a political community." ("Amicitia ... eligitur propter convivere, sine autem convivere non est civitas: quare amicitia necessaria est ad civitatem .... ") It should be kept in mind that this portion of the commentary was written by Peter of Auvergne, not Thomas Aquinas.

certain effect of virtue.! It is an elective habit, and falls within the genus of justice, having to do with a proportionate distribution of various kinds of goods. Friendship is not the end of the political community; the end is the sharing in common of good actions.

Friendship is what is best in life; that is, the best exterior good.2 People seek the solace of friends in adversity, and in prosperity they still seek friendship. Without friendship, no one would choose to live. Similarly, without civic friendship, no group of people would choose to live in common in a political community. Civic friendship, friendship existing among fellow citizens, is the sharing in common of exterior goods.

Legislators should be concerned certainly for justice3, but also for friendship, because friendship is what holds a political community together.4 In their various interventions (for example, in imposing penalties for crimes), legislators should act in such a way that the particular action in question does not foment dissension. Penal justice is less important than friendship or concord: relatively lenient sentences are sometimes required for the sake of maintaining concord. The agreement of a large portion of the population seems essential to the maintenance of the social fabric. Further on in this chapter, we shall see what this agreement involves.

Aquinas describes friendship as "a certain union or society of friends, which cannot exist among people who are very far apart [socially or economically]. [These people] must approach equality."S Friendship, including civic friendship,

*5Ibid.,* 1632, "(A)micitia eat quaedam unio sive societas amicorum, quae non potest esse inter multum distantes, sed oportet quod ad aequalitatem accedant."

<sup>1</sup> In VIII Ethic., no. 1538.

*<sup>2</sup>Ibid.,* 1539.

<sup>3</sup>Aquinas defines justice as "the habit according to which someone, by a firm and stable Will, gives to each and every person what is his or her right." ST Ila Ilae, 58, 1, c. "(I)ustitia est habitus secundum quem aliquis constanti et perpetua voluntate ius suum unicuique tribuit." 4In VIII Ethic., 1542.

presumes some measure of equality among people who are friends. Distributive justice, on the other hand, starts with a situation of inequality and seeks to redress it -- not numerically or arithmetically (as in the case of commutative justice), but proportionally or geometrically, according to the proportion of people's merit and needs. Distributive justice, by which civic responsibilities are given to the best citizens, is more important than commutative justice, which deals with exchanges among individuals. Friendship is presupposed for the political community to exist, and justice must reinforce or restore friendship. Civic friendship can grow in a political community only when some measure of distributive justice has been attained, and when public responsibilities are distributed according to merit. If such has not happened, then those who are less endowed with the bona communia will be, in effect, excluded from the bonds of civic friendship which unite others in the community. Where civic friendship does exist, however, the pursuit of justice becomes superfluous to the extent that some measure of justice has already been attained.!

In an article entitled "Justice and Friendship", Gerald B. Phelan expands on this latter point:

> Commutative justice, by establishing a certain arithmetical equality between the values of things which men need, sets up a standard in which equity in the exchange of goods may be attained and things which are equal in value may be traded for equally valuable things [Ethics V, 5 1130b-1131a; V, 6, 1131a]. Distributive justice, by establishing a like equality, this time not arithmetical but proportional, between the members of the community, lays the foundation for an equitable distribution of the honors and burdens of the common life among the individuals who comprise the

<sup>!</sup>Distributive justice is the common good. If this justice is not respected, then there is no more concord or friendship. Injustice engenders enmity. Cf. In VIII Ethic., 1839.

group, each receiving his proportionate share in view of his dignity and position in the social order .I

There are two things which should be added to Phelan's explanation. First, it is more accurate to speak of the individuals, families, and intermediate groups which make up the political community, than to speak merely of the "individuals which comprise the group"; political society is not only a group of individuals but also a network of smaller communities, many of which overlap. Secondly, the distribution of responsibilities often presumes that their recipients already have what is needed for life. When this is not presumed, certain responsibilities carry with them a form of remuneration. More fundamentally, in so many of our political communities, there are sectors of society where people lack even such necessities as shelter and employment. Before. there can be any mention of the distribution of responsibilities, there must, out of justice, be a distribution of basic necessities of lif~ to those who lack them. That is why I have added that the distribution of the bona communia be based on need as well as on merit.2

lGerald B. Phelan, "Justice and Friendship", Maritain volume of The Thomist, V (Jan. 1943), p. 157.

<sup>2</sup>At first glance, Aquinas seems to be suggesting something similar in In VIII Ethic., 1749, when he comments on Aristotle's statement that some people in society are given responsibility, while others are given money. Aquinas writes, "Through [the distribution of] wealth, assistance is given against the need which the lower classes suffer." ("Sed per lucrum praestatur auxilium contra indigentiam, quam patiuntur inferiores.")

It would be a misinterpretation of Aquinas, however, to understand his remarks in terms of social assistance. Aquinas understands all aid to the poor in terms of almsgiving. This is Aquinas' belief even with regard to the aid given by rulers. Social assistance, on the other hand, is of modern origin, a response to the failure of industrial societies to meet the basic needs of many of their members. I am arguing for the necessity of such assistance as a modern application of distributive justice. I do not, however, wish to make Aquinas say something he did not explicitly say.

justice, adds Phelan, does not hold society together.! This is especially true of commutative justice, which can exist among individuals who do not belong to the same political community. It is friendship which is the glue that holds society together. It is social bonds such as marriage and religious groups which prepare civic life by fostering friendship. Distributive justice is essential because there is no virtuous life without it; that is to say, there is no sharing in life lived well (communicatio bene vivendi). Distributive justice is the dispositive cause of the political community; it provides the "matter" of life in common. Civic friendship is the formal cause of society; it is civic friendship which constitutes and structures political life. Friendship involves living in common but not, as yet, living *well* in common, or sharing in good actions. Friendship prepares political life and is reinforced by political life; it is not the end of political life but rather the means.

All friendship consists in the sharing of something in common (communicatio).Z All sharing is reduced to a political relationship. Therefore all friendships should be understood as "political communications"; that is, the sharing of some good in a life lived in common with others. Aristotle and Aquinas give some examples from custom or usage: Fellow seamen are called friends because they have navigation in common; fellow soldiers, because they have military action in common. If there is friendship among these groups of people, then it follows, for the reasons given above, that there is also justice among them. The point is that friendship, as well as justice, consists in the sharing of a good, whether it be an activity, a way of life, or a common goal. Civic friendship consists of the pursuit of the political common good, shared in common by all citizens.

There are different kinds of friendship according to the different kinds of sharing in common.3 Siblings who live under

the same roof share everything. People who are not so close share only some things: some more, some less. Friendships are greater or lesser to the extent that what is shared in common is more or less. If there were nothing shared in common, there could be no friendship.

Aquinas specifies that what is shared by friends is something useful, a means to a further goal:

> (A)ll those who share in something, agree on some useful thing; that is, to acquire something of what is necessary for life. Political communication also seems to have this [characteristic just mentioned]: for citizens seem to have come together in agreement from the beginning, and to persevere in this [agreement], for the sake of the common advantage)

The analogy is that j.ust as individuals and families come together in agreement over things which are necessary for life, fellow citizens come together in agreement over things which are necessary for living well. Whereas the end of the family is the life of its members, the end of the political community is that its members live well, that they live happily by engaging in virtuous actions.

In the commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, Aquinas further indicates that that which is agreed upon is some good specific to life in common:

> (W)e love our neighbors, in that our good is to be found in them by similarity. (We are speaking here of the love of benevolence.) But this similarity is attained to the extent that we share something in common with our neighbors. And hence the Philosopher distinguishes according to diverse friendships .... The third kind of

lJbid., 1665. "(O)mnes communicantes conveniunt in aliquo utili; ad hoc scilicet quod acquirunt aliquod eorum, qui sunt necessaria vitae. Et hoc etiam yidetur habere politica communicatio: quia propter utilitatem communem videntur cives, et a principio simul convenisse, et in hoc perseverare."

sharing in common is political, according to which people share in common with their fellow citizens .

. . . (A)ccording to each of the friendships already mentioned, friends are to be loved according to the goods pertaining to the sharing in common on which the friendship is founded. Hence . . . [love is owing] to fellow citizens in those things which regard civil life .... I

He adds that civil works or projects require that fellow citizens work together simultaneously and for long periods of time. This common effort is the basis of the bond among fellow citizens. Unlike the bond uniting families, which Aquinas calls "natural"2, the bond among fellow citizens is a matter of common deliberation and decision over certain specific tasks, and of the execution of these tasks. Aquinas' statement does not mean that the bond of civic friendship is against nature. The natural inclination to political life is more important for virtuous living than is the natural inclination toward family life. Our disposition to live in political communities is part of our nature.

All the various kinds of friendship are contained under political friendship.3 This point of view can be understood in relation to the Aristotelian world-view which holds that the political community is the highest form of community, and that everything, including the worship of the gods, is contained within and regulated by that community. Various friendships share in common a particular utility, whereas civic friendship shares what is useful for the whole of life. Civic friendship

<sup>1</sup> In III Sent., 29, 9, c. "(P)roximos diligimus, inquantum in eis bonum nostrum per similitudinem invenitur, loquendo de amore benevolentiae. Haec autem similitudo attenditur secundum quod cum eis communicamus. Unde et secundum diversas amicitias Philosophus distinguit. . . . Alia [tertia] vero communicatio est politica, secundum quam homines ad concives suos communicant . . . . (S)ecundum unamquamque praedictarum amicitiarum

amandi sunt amici quantum ad bona pertinentia ad communicationem illam super quam amicitia fundatur. Unde ... ad concives in his quae civilem vitam spectant .... "

<sup>2</sup>cf. response to the first objection in the same article. 3Aquinas, In VIII Ethic.,l669.

could be seen as a whole, ordered to the common advantage, of which other friendships are parts, ordered to particular advantages.l Aristotle does not hold that there are communities above and beyond the political community, and therefore he does not hold that there are friendships higher than political friendship. The fact that Aquinas holds for a supernatural order, leaves open the possibility, on this view, of higher forms of friendship. For every level of sharing in common, there is a level of friendship.

#### The relationship between governments and political friendship

The principle at work in Aquinas' treatment of civic friendship in various species of government, is that friendship is possible to the extent that there is equality. Equality need not be perfect for friendship to exist; there can be varying degrees of equality and inequality. If the inequality becomes very great, however, friendship becomes impossible. To serve the common good, and therefore to be a true form of government, presupposes just actions: those actions which, as much as possible, reduce existing inequalities and establish some measure of equality.

> Table 5.0 Species of political communities their true forms and corruptions (In VIII Ethic. 1673-1679)

I. Monarchy

True form: Kingship Corruption: Tyranny: for the good of one person only.

II. Rule by a few

True form: Aristocracy Corruption: Oligarchy: for the good of the rich only.

1 *Ibid.,* 1671.

III. [Polity I Constitutional Government I Republic] True form: Timocracy

Corruption: Democracy: exclusively for the good of the poor I the multitude I the populus.

What characterizes true forms of political communities, communities where there is both justice and friendship, is the pursuit of the common good, the good of the whole political community.

When we look at how each of the political communities just schematized degenerates into its corrupt form, it becomes plain, by way of contrast, how civic friendship is exercised in each of these regimes, and how the corruption of each regime coincides with the breakdown of civic friendship.

A king, first of all, must be outstanding in all goods "of soul and body, and of exterior matters" .I He is to be selfsufficient and in possession of a superabundance of external goods, so that he will be able to take these goods and bestow them on his fellow citizens according to their respective dignity and need. Although kingship has, at its starting-point, a high degree of inequality between the goods of the king and those of other citizens, the king's conferral of these goods brings about a measure of equality. When, on the other hand, a monarch is not self-sufficient in goods to be bestowed, or when he keeps most or all of the goods to himself or to a small group of personal friends, then the result is tyranny, a regime ordered to the good of the tyrant.

Two things are to be noted here. First, it is apparent that the first sense in which Aristotle and Aquinas understand the pursuit of the political common good, is in the relatively equitable distribution of wealth and responsibilities. Neither hold that this is the only way in which the common good can be pursued, but it is a beginning of such a pursuit. Other advantages cannot be had if most of the bona communia are in

lJbid., 1677. "et animae et corporis, et exteriorum rerum .... "

the hands of a small number of people. Secondly, there is a difference between distributing wealth and responsibilities to citizens out of civic friendship, and distributing these favors to a small group of personal friends (patronage, in other words). Civic friendship, as we have seen, deals with what is necessary for the whole of life, and its end is the good of the whole political community. Other friendships deal with some particular advantage, and their end is either the pleasure, utility, or virtue of a small number of people. Now, to bestow the bona communia on a small group of friends, is to take what belongs to the whole and to give it to a part; it is to take what is for the common good of the whole political community, and to subordinate it to the private good of a few friends, without due regard for these people's contribution to the common good.

The corruption or perversion of an aristocracy is something similar to the corruption of kingship, except that the bona communia fall into the hands of a larger number of people. Commenting on Aristotle, Aquinas writes that an aristocracy degenerates into an oligarchy on account of the wickedness of those who are governing:

> They do not distribute the goods of the political community according to dignity, but they usurp for themselves all the goods of the political community, or many of them. They are always conferring rule on the same people, thereby directing the multitude so that they and their friends will become rich. I

The same principle is at work in the degeneration of timocracy into democracy.2 Timocracy and democracy have two traits in

lJbid., 1678. "Et hoc propter malitiam eorum qui principantur; qui bona civitatis non distribuunt secundum dignitatem, sed omnia bona civitatis vel plurima eorum usurpunt sibiipsis, et semper principatus eisdem conferunt, hoc plurimum intendentes, ut ditentur ipsi et amici eorum."

<sup>2</sup>For the benefit of readers not familiar with Aristotelian-Thomistic terminology, it must be emphasized that 'democracy' here does not mean an elected government. It means, rather, government by the multitude, to the exclusion of a minority, in this case the rich. Such a

common: they consist of government by the multitude, and all those in office (in honoribus) are on an equal footing.! Their difference lies in that, in a timocracy, those in power watch over the common good of rich and poor alike, while in a democracy, they watch over the good of the poor only. Aquinas calls a democratic city-state the least corruption (minima perversitas) of the various corrupt forms of government because, although a democracy is not for the advantage of the whole political community, the number of people who benefit from such a system is nevertheless quite large.

The main difference among the three forms of government lies in the varying degrees of equality and inequality of the goods initially held by the rulers. The three regimes have this characteristic in common: that when the government is just, civic friendship is rendered possible by an equitable distribution of wealth and responsibilities, in such a way that the greatest possible measure of equality is attained as a result. These communities become unjust, and civic friendship breaks down, when the bona communia are distributed only to a restricted number of people, such that the political community is governed for the advantage of these people only. In that event, the initial inequality is diminished

Furthermore, 'monarchy', 'kingship', and 'tyranny' refer to regimes where only one person has any real power. A system in which a political community is effectively governed by Parliament or an Assembly is not,. on this view, a monarchy, regardless of the name given to the ceremonial ruler.

For all the forms of government just mentioned, the means by which the ruler or ruling group accedes to power (inheritance, universal suffrage, or some other means), does not enter into the definition. At the same time, no just government is against the wishes of the multitude.

lAquinas, *In Vlll Ethic.,* 1679.

regime can exist only in a very small State, because the multitude, and not elected representatives, are the ones who legislate.

Also, 'aristocracy' does not mean government by a ruling class determined by inheritance. It means government by "the best" ( *aristoi),* the most virtuous -- invariably a small number. If that small number of people happens not to be the best, then there is no aristocracy but rather an oligarchy.

very little or not at all. To diminish initial inequalities is to practice distributive justice; civic friendship can begin only when large-scale inequalities are diminished. 1

Civic friendship consists of _the communicatio, or sharing in common, of the goods of the political community. In a just political community, those in power share many of the bona communia, and consequently the bonds of friendship are strong. In a corrupt political community, however, those in power share little or nothing with those whom they govern, and consequently there is little or no friendship:

> It is plain that if there is nothing common between the ruler and the one ruled (i.e., when the ruler seeks his own good), friendship will not be able to exist among them, since justice does not exist among them-- in that the ruler usurps to himself the whole of the good that is owing to the one ruled. 2

Tyranny is the worst instance of injustice and the most corrupt form of government, in that only the tyrant and his entourage benefit from the bona communia, and little else is shared among the other citizens. And since there is little, or even nothing, shared in common, there is little or no civic friendship.

<sup>!</sup>Aristotle and Aquinas compare the three forms of government to three kinds of domestic relationships. Kingship is compared to the relationship of father and children, aristocracy to man and wife, and timocracy to siblings of roughly the same age. These references to domestic life as lived in Aristotle's time are given by way of example. I shall not discuss them any further, except to point out that nowhere is a just government compared to the relationship between master and slave, even though slavery was an accepted part of domestic life among the privileged classes. I refer the reader to the Nicmachean Ethics, VIll, chs. 10 and 11 (McKeon edition); 1160b23-1161a29; and to In VIII Ethic., nos. 1681-1695. Note the discrepancy in chapter numbering between the McKeon edition and the Latin text of Aristotle on which Aquinas comments: chapters 10 and 11 in the McKeon edition are chapters 12 and 13 in the Latin text.

<sup>2</sup>Aquinas, In VIII Ethic., 1698. "Manifestum est, quod si inter imperantem et imperatum nihil sit commune, puta cum imperans suum proprium bqnum intendit; neque amicitia inter eos esse poterit, sicut neque iustitia est inter eos, in,quantum scilicet imperans usurpat sibi totum bonum, quod debetur imperato."

Tyranny, we recall, is the corruption of monarchy, which is any kind of one-person rule. Aristotle's and Aquinas' opinions on such a regime are a two-edged sword. On the one hand, they have nothing but good things to say about an enlightened ruler who bestows benefits on his fellow citizens. The excellence of such a person is what makes that form of government excellent in Aristotle's and Aquinas' eyes. On the other hand, the worst corruption is the corruption of the best. When a monarch does not distribute the goods and benefits belonging to the whole of the political community, then that form of government degenerates from best of all to worst of all. Compare this to Aristotle's and Aquinas' statements about timocracy. Aquinas, in particular, considers that the more people there are who rule, the more mediocre the regime will be. At the same time, the corruption of a timocracy is the least corrupt of the various corrupt regimes. There is little movement from the true form to the corruption thereof.

The images which Aristotle and Aquinas use to describe the behavior of tyrants toward their subjects, convey the idea that subjects in those regimes are treated as though they were passive instruments, incapable of intelligent, voluntary action.I Tyrants relate to their subjects as craftsman to instrument, as soul to body, or as master to slave. A slave, we·recall, is "used" by the master, not for the good of the slave, but for the good of the master. Similarly, tyrants use their subjects as slaves, for the good of the tyrant only. To use someone else is to move or to "push" that person as though the person were inanimate - literally as though the person did not have a soul. Now, it is impossible for there to be friendship between a person who is being used as an instrument in this way, and the one who is using that "instrument", much as there cannot be friendship with an inanimate instrument or with a beast of burden, even though brutes are animate.

1 Ibid., 1698-1699.

It is interesting to note that, as we have seen in Chapter One, the dignity of human persons consists in our potential, as a species, to act intelligently and freely. In conjunction with this, it is striking that slavery, although a well established custom in Aristotle's and Aquinas' lifetimes, does not figure as a model for any of the true forms of government, but is the model, on the contrary, for the most corrupt regime.

> And so also there is no friendship of master to slave inasmuch as he is a slave, because he does not have anything [in] common [with his master]; the whole good of the slave is that of the master, just as the whole good of the instrument is that of the craftsman. For a slave is, as it were, an animate instrument; and vice versa, an instrument is, as it were, an inanimate slave.l

When human dignity is understood as the capacity for intelligent and voluntary action, and when slavery is viewed as the paradigm of tyranny, it takes only one more step to · recognize the incompatibility of slavery with the dignity of human nature. To suggest that Aristotle and Aquinas imply such a step is to read too much into the text.2 They do add, however, that although there cannot be friendship of master to slave qua slave, there can nonetheless be friendship of master to slave qua human being, in that there can be a legal agreement between a master and a slave.3 A slave is a human person, but the institution of slavery does not treat the slave as a person. Similarly, citizens in a tyrannical regime are human

3 Ibid., 1700.

<sup>1</sup> Ibid., 1699. "Et ita etiam non est amicitia domini ad servum inquantum est servus, quia non habet aliquid commune sed totum bonum servi est domini, sicut totum bonum instrumenti est artificis. Servus enim est quasi instrumentum animatum, sicut et e converso instrumentum est quasi servus inanimatus."

<sup>2</sup>The Roman jurist Ulpian, writing in the third century A.D., states that slavery is not against the law of peoples (i.e., it is widely accepted), but that it is against natural law (i.e., it is against the essential equality of people as bearers of logos, ·of reason.) See Guy Haarscher, Philosophie des droits de l'homme, (Bruxelles: Les Presses de l'Universite de Bruxelles, 1987), p. 65.

persons, but the institution of tyranny does not treat them as persons. Tyranny is the institution of slavery writ large.

# Aquinas' words to the King of Cyprus on civic friendship

After Aquinas' death, a draft of a letter on kingship written to the King of Cyprus was found among Aquinas' personal papers. There is no evidence that another copy of this letter was ever sent to the king, and only fragments of the letter are extant.! Within these fragments, there are a couple of passages on civic friendship, and it is helpful to discuss these as a complement to Aquinas' other writings on the subject, especially his commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics.

In Book I, Chapter 3, Aquinas expands on his stated preference for kingship as opposed to aristocracy and timocracy. He explains that a force for good is stronger to the extent that it is one; that is, indivisible. And a king, being only one person, cannot be divided against himself. In an aristocracy, however, and especially in a timocracy2, there is the possibility that the rulers will be divided among themselves, thus hindering their effectiveness in pursuing the common good. Conversely, a force for evil is more powerful to the extent that it also is undivided. A tyrant is therefore most effective in subordinating the common good to his own good. Oligarchies and demol::racies, however, are less corrupt in that there is more of a chance that the rulers will hinder their own effectiveness by working against each other.

I For the history of the manuscript De Regno, see I. Th. Eschmann's introduction to On Kingship to the King of Cyprus (Gerald B. Phelan, tr., Westport, Conn.: Hyperion Press, 1979), pp. ix-xxxix. Englishlanguage quotations of De Regno are those of Phelan's translation.

<sup>2</sup>Aquinas uses the word 'polity' (politia) instead of 'timocracy' in this work. 'Politia' has several meanings in Aquinas' works, depending on the context. It can mean either the generic name for government by the multitude (as in the commentary on the Nicomachean Ethics), or any political community, whether just or unjust (In Ethic. and In Pol., passim), or a timocracy (De Regno). One can determine the meaning in a given instance only by looking at the context.

If a tyrant wishes to maintain control, he will ensure that his subjects, against whose good he is working, will be incapable of virtuous actions. Otherwise in their valor they will rise up against the tyrant. Also, the subjects .must be rendered ineffective by being divided among themselves. Specifically:

> [Tyrants] also see to it that there be no friendly relations among [their subjects] so that they may not enjoy the benefits resulting from being on good. terms with one another, for as long as one has no confidence in the other, no plot will be set up against the tyrant's domination. Wherefore they sow discords among the people, foster any that have arisen, and forbid anything which furthers society and co-operation among men, such as marriage, company at table and anything of like character, through which familiarity and confidence are engendered among men. I

What is presumed in this passage is that there must be civic friendship if people are to pursue the common good. Now ~e behavior of tyrants is inimical to the common good. If, then, friendships are allowed to develop, these will lead to even broader networks of friendships, until some measure of civic friendship is attained. The subjects will then conduct themselves not as slaves but as citizens, pursuing the common good and resisting its prinCipal obstacle: the tyrant.

lDe Regno (also known as De regimine principum ad regem Cypri), I, 3. "Conantur igitur . . . tyranni ... ne inter subditos amicitiae foedus firmetur, et pacis emolomento ad invicem gaudeant, ut sic dum unus de altero non confidit, contra eorum dominium aliquid moliri non possint. Propter quod inter ipsos discordias seminant, exortas nutriunt, et ea quae ad foederationem hominum pertinent, ut connubia et convivia, prohibent, et caetera · huiusmodi, per quae inter homines solet familiaritas et fiducia generari."

In the English translation, op. cit. , Eschmann comments, in a footnote, that the reference to the forbidding of marriage is probably an innovation of Aquinas'. It is not to be found in Aristotle's account (see Pol. V, 11; 1313a35-1314a29, of which the above text is a paraphrase), or in any of its medieval versions. ·

In Book I, Chapter 10 of the same series of fragments, Aquinas explains that the pursuit of the common good goes hand-in-hand with friendship. When the common good is not pursued, friendship is not possible because there is nothing common I upon which to base it. Tyrants are not loved because they do not behave in ways which inspire love.2 Good kings are loved by the multitude when they love their subjects and pursue the common good, and when the subjects perceive that there are benefits to be derived from the king' s care for them.

Consequently, the rule of a good king is stable because his subjects, who love him, are willing to expose themselves to great dangers for his sake. Tyrants' rule lacks such stability because they are hated by the people. "What is against the wishes of the multitude cannot be long preserved."3 The multitude who hate a tyrant will readily support an insurgent, and therefore the tyrant cannot rely on the loyalty of his subjects. And when the actions of an insurgent have the support of the people, then the insurgence is likely to succeed.

The rule of a tyrant is maintained, not by friendship as in the case of a just ruler, but by fear. Fear, however, is a weak support: people will revolt as soon as they think they can get away with it. The more they have been oppressed, the more fiercely they will revolt. And, if they are so much oppressed that they despair of their safety, then they will boldly do anything. Tyranny, therefore, rarely lasts a long time, unless the tyrant is not too oppressive.

Tyranny is also very costly, because tyrants have to hire bodyguards to protect them from the multitude. One is reminded of Aristotle's saying that the bodyguards cannot really be trusted, either, unless they are foreigners, for in that way they will be less likely to be on the side of the multitude

<sup>1</sup> In this work, Aquinas uses the word *'communio'* instead of *'communicatio'.* There is nothing to suggest that he intends a different meaning from the one already discussed for *'communicatio'.* 

<sup>2</sup>Aquinas uses *'amor'* and *'amicitia'* interchangeably in this work.

<sup>3</sup>Aquinas, *De* Regno, I, 10. "Non potest enim diu conservari, quod votis multorum repugnat."

and plot against the tyrant. Also, Aquinas' portrait of a tyrant surrounded by bodyguards needs only little adaptation to be applied to modern dictatorships where a large portion of the national budget is spent on security.

We have only to reverse Aquinas' negative statements about tyranny in order to see the role of a just ruler concerning civic friendship. When just rulers seek the common good rather than their own good, they have much in common with their fellow citizens; there is much communion among them. If they behave in such a way that they are loved by their. fellow citizens, such that the citizens benefit from their rule, and if they are moderate in the use of power, then they are likely to be in power for a relatively long time. It is civic friendship, and. not fear or threats, which upholds the governance of a just ruler. Finally, since the governance of a just ruler is pleasing to the vast majority of the people, "national security" is less of a priority; there is more money to spend on other things.

How are we to interpret Aquinas' preference for government by one person, as opposed to government by a larger number?l The ease with which monarchy degenerates into tyranny is the principal reason for which one-person rule, however widespread, has fallen into disrepute in our own time. The experience of so many States, especially in this century, has shown that tyranny is too great a risk to take, especially when one considers the size of modern States, the technology with which unjust regimes are able to buttress their control, and the military might with which they are able to defend their interests. What are called democracies, in the modern sense of the word, are the equivalent of aristocracies or oligarchies in the Aristotelian sense, depending on the degree of justice and injustice to be found within them. These systems of government have their inherent inefficiencies, but

<sup>1</sup> In the Summa theologiae, Aquinas states a preference for a mixed regime; that_ is, one where a ruler governs in conjunction with other sectors of society, including the multitude. Such a system is a combination of kingship, aristocracy, and polity. Cf. Ia Ilae, 95, 4, c.

inefficiency is a _lesser peril than tyranny. Furthermore, the election of governments by the people ensures that those who rule, though small in number, neverthel~_ss have some degree of accountability to the people who elected them. If these political leaders pursue their own interests at the expense of the common good, thereby becoming oligarchic, then they can be easily replaced within a few years. By placing limits on the power of rulers, and by making the rulers accol,Jntable to the people not only in name but also in fact, democracies in the modern sense serve as a safeguard against tyranny, and offer a non-violent means of disposing of oligarchies.

# The effects of civic friendship

Any kind of friendship has three effects: benevolence or goodwill, concord, and beneficence. Goodwill means to want another person to be and to live. In perfect friendship, it involves willing everything that is good for that person. Unlike *amatio,* which is a strong passion resulting from frequent contact with another person, goodwill is a simple movement of thewill, which can be aroused suddenly and without any prior habit. As Aristotle puts it, "Goodwill ... seems to be a beginning of friendship, as the pleasure of the eye is the beginning of love."l It means being well disposed toward another person, having a fundamental attitude of approval toward another person. Merely to be benevolent is not sufficient for there to be friendship. There are two reasons for this. First, one can be benevolent toward people whom one hardly knows. Goodwill, unlike perfect friendship, does not require proximity or frequent contact. It does not involve the investment of time and energy which friendship involves. Secondly, goodwill, of itself, does not lead to action. One can have an attitude of approval toward someone without doing

I Aristotle, Nic. Ethics, IX, 5, 1167a3-4.

anything about it.l Although not sufficient for friendship, goodwill is necessary for friendship: there can be goodwill without there being anything more than what Aristotle and Aquinas call an idle friendship, but there cannot be friendship without goodwill. Friendship, in other words, is more than goodwill, and it is more than fellow-feeling or a feeling of affection; what is essential to friendship is readiness to act.

It is concord, the second effect of friendship, which brings about this readiness to act. Concord is agreement on things to be done, things which are of importance and are for the common good. It is not agreement on matters of speculative opinion, for people who share similar opinions do not always agree on things to be done, and are not always friends.Z Also, people who agree on common projects and who are friends, do not always share the same opinions; differences of speculative opinion do not destroy friendship. As john Monagle puts it, "What is essential is that [friends] come together to agree about what is mutually beneficial and work together on projects which will promote their common interest."3 This latter point is particularly relevant to civic friendship. Much as two people come together in agreement over projects which are for their mutual advantage, citizens of a political community, or even of more than one political community, come together in agreement over projects which promote the common good. Aristotle goes so far as to identify concord with civic friendship, "for it [concord] is concerned with things that are to our interest and have an influence on our life. "4 Examples which he gives of concord are agreement that public offices should be elective, that a pact should be made with another political community, and that this or that person should rule. This process of agreement is analogous to an individual's deliberation over the means of attaining a

146

lMonagle, op. *cit.,* pp. 60-63.

<sup>2</sup>Monagle, op. *cit.,* p. 63.

<sup>3</sup> Ibid., p. 64 ..

<sup>4</sup>Nic. Ethics IX, 6; 1167b2-4. See also In VIII Ethic., 1836.

particular end: citizens deliberate over what is useful, over those things to be done which, when carried out, serve as means of attaining the common good of all citizens. Such agreement over things to be done is possible even if there are widespread differences of opinion over speculative matters; what is important for the existence of civic friendship is that citizens unite in the carrying out of common projects. Once again, we see that what brings people together as friends is something other than the friendship itself; friends share in a common purpose and a common task. Similarly, civic friendship exists for the promotion of the common good. One is reminded of Maritain's referring to the promotion of the common good as a common task, a common work to be done.

The third effect of friendship is beneficence. To be beneficent means to do good for one's friends.l Aquinas states that goodwill and beneficence differ only as interior and act: for beneficence is the execution of goodwill.2 If I will all that is good for another person, and if I am beneficent, then my goodwill will translate itself into a firm and stable habit of doing good things for the other person, according to my ability and that person's need. Aristotle is particularly strong on this point; friendship is above all else a kind of poiesis; an action carried out not for its own sake but in order to produce something beyond it.3 If the end or purpose of friendship is an honest good, something worth seeking for its own sake, then the friendship will be long-lasting and solid. This is the case because those who are beneficent, and who work hard at doing good things for others, will love those others more than if they had done nothing for others, or if they had taken very few pains for these others. The good of others will be a product of the benefactor, an extension of the benefactor. A friend is, in this sense, another self. 4 The goodwill, oneness of mind, and

lsr, Ila Ilae, 31, 1, sed contra.

<sup>2</sup>sr, Ila Ilae, 31, 4, sed contra.

*<sup>3</sup>Nic.* Ethics ,-IX, 7, passim.

<sup>4</sup>Nic. *Ethics* IX,4; 1166a29-1166b2.

beneficence which we have toward ourselves extends itself to goodwill, concord, and beneficence toward others. Love of others, then, is an extension of love of self. It should be noted, however, that friendship is not destroyed if beneficence is not possible. A true friend will remain a friend even if he or she receives nothing in return. I

On the level of civic friendship, beneficence is the carrying out of those projects on which citizens have agreed. It is the production of something beyond the societal relationships themselves. These relationships, in fact, eXist for the realization of those projects which are for the common good. The consequence of this beneficence is a greater love of one's fellow citizens, because the good of one's fellow citizens will, be an extension of those who have contributed to it. If I have worked for a greater measure of justice, then I will love . my fellow citizens more, having put a part of myself into their well-being.

#### Conclusion

The three kinds of friendship correspond to the three divisions of the good. There is the good as pleasure (bonum delectabile), the good as utility (bonum utile), and the honest good (bonum honestum), the good worth seeking for its own sake. In order to know how the three different kinds of friendship relate to one another, it is helpful to enquire as to the relationship among the three divisions of the good. We shall then see how civic friendship fits into this schema.

On the point of the divisions of the good, one possible opinion is that of Albert the Great (1200?-1280), the mentor of Thomas Aquinas, who holds that the good is a particular kind of whole, in that each of its parts includes all the parts preceding it:

lMonagle, op. *cit.,* p. 65.

The division of the good . . . is the division of a potestative or virtual whole, the parts of which are related to the thing divided, such that the thing divided is preserved according to its perfection only in the last part. But in those parts which are before the last, [the whole] is preserved and indeed predicated of these, but according to a diminished perfection of its power .... Also, there is another thing about a potestative whole: namely, that the next part always includes the preceding part in itself .... because whatever an inferior power can do, a superior power can also do, but not vice versa. I

(N)one of its parts causes sufficiently, but rather the prior is always a material cause to the one following.2

In other words, a useful good is also pleasurable, and an honest good is both pleasurable and useful. A pleasurable good is not useful for something else, however, and neither a pleasurable good nor a useful good are worth seeking for their own· sake. They are indeed parts of the good, albeit with less power than an honest good. Only in the honest good, the last part, is the good preserved according to its perfection.

Now, in every friendship there is a "third party", so to speak, the end for which the friendship exists. This is the object of the *communicatio,* the sharing in common, upon which the friendship is founded, for every friendship exists for something other than itself. What is shared in common is the end, whether it be pleasure, utility, or an honest good-- which, in the case of friendships for the sake of the good, is virtue.

lAibert the Great, DeBono, 2, 1, sol. "(D)ivisio boni ... est divisio totius potestativi sive virtualis, cuius partes sic se habent ad divisum, quod divisum non salvatur secundum suam perfectionem nisi in ultima. In his autem quae sunt ante ultimum, salvatur quidem et praedicatur de ipsis, sed secundum diminutam perfectionem suae potestatis. . . . In toto etiam potestativo aliud est, scilicet quod sequens pars semper praecedentem in se claudit ... quia quidquid potest potestas inferior, potest et superior, sed non convertitur."

<sup>2</sup>Jbid., 4, 2, ad 9. "(N)ulla suarum partium causat sufficienter, sed potius semper prior materialis est ad sequentem."

John Monagle argues that friendships for the sake of virtue are prior to the other two kinds of friendship:

> Friendships of pleasure and utility are by posterity in the sense that the three types do not differ in kind as three equal species of a genus. But the latter are posterior to friendship based on bonum honestum which is prior in the sense that it is primarily and essentially that to which the notion of friendship pertains and that in which the qualities of the other two are to be found in their best form. I

I agree that an honest good includes all the elements of the other two divisions of the good, and that friendship in its perfection is to be found only in friendship for the sake of virtue. I have difficulty, however, with the notion that friendship for the sake of virtue relates to the other two as prior to posterior. At least if one accepts Albert's explanation of the divisions of the good as applied to friendship, the conclusion is that a pleasurable good and a useful good are prior in the sense that they are material causes of an honest good. If the good is a potestative or virtual whole, then an honest good is the last of three parts. Similarly, friendship for the sake of virtue is posterior, and includes all the perfections of the other two kinds of friendship. It is true that an honest good as final cause is prior to the othC7r causes, but it does not follow that friendship for virtue is prior to the other kinds of friendship in this way. A less perfect kind of friendship exists, not for another kind of friendship, but for some good. All friendships, even the most perfect kind, exist for a good other than themselves.

Where does civic friendship fit into this picture? Perhaps one of the reasons for which some people often believe civic friendship to be impossible in itself, is that they have in mind only that friendship by which we love other people for themselves alone. Clearly, it is impossible to have

<sup>1</sup> John Monagle, op. *cit.,* pp. 53f.

friendship of this kind for fellow citizens, at least not for many of them. Commenting on the Nicomachean Ethics, Aquinas puts it this way:

> (I)t happens to be the case [that people can be friends of many] according to political friendship, not only in that mode by which some peaceable person is a friend of many, but this is fitting even for someone truly virtuous. For it was said above [no. 1836] that political friendship seems to be the same as concord. But a virtuous person is of one mind with many people in those things which pertain to political life. Nevertheless it does not happen that the virtuous person has friendship towards many people for the sake of virtue, so that he or she loves them for their own sakes and not only for the sake of something useful or pleasurable. Most certainly it ought to be lovable and dear to a man if he could find a few such friends; i.e., [friends] for the sake of virtue and for their own sake. I

To say without nuance that civic friendship is for the political common good, is to make too quick a step from the end of civic friendship to the end of the political community itself. What is shared in common is not immediately the end itself of political life, but the means to the achievement of that end. Fellow citizens come together in agreement over that which the political common good consists of (e.g., social reforms), and over the things to be done, the common projects carried out for the sake of the political common good. In this sense, civic friendship is friendship for the sake of utility.

lAquinas, In IX Ethic, 1924. "(H)oc contingit esse secundum amicitiarn politicarn, non solum eo modo quo aliquis placidus est amicus multorum, sed etiam hoc potest competere alicui vere virtuoso. Dictum est enim supra [no. 1836], quod politica amicitia videtur idem esse quam concordia. Virtuosus autem cum multis concordat in his quae pertinent ad vitam politicam. Non tamen contingit quod virtuosus habeat amicitiam ad multos propter virtutem, ita quod diligit eos propter seipsos, et non solum propter utile vel delectabile. Quinimo multum debet esse liomini amabile et carum, si paucos tales amieos possit invenire, scilicet propter virtu tern et secundum seipsos."

# CHAPTER SIX A SYNTHESIS

#### I. ELEMENTS OF THE ANALYSIS

# The dignity of the human person

We have seen that the relationship of human persons to the rest of the community is, in large measure, another formulation of the problem of part and whole. A person is a whole, but also a part of something else. How can human persons be part of a political community (or part of any community, for that matter), without losing their own act of existence and being constituted by that larger whole? People's experience under totalitarian regimes, of whatever ideological stripe, underscores the fact that this risk is no mere hypothetical concern. In order to bring together the various parts of the analysis so far, and thus to give some idea of the broader picture, I shall describe briefly the "pieces of the puzzle", so to speak, and then endeavor to put them together.

The analysis of Aristotle's treatment of the one, a part, and a whole, has shown that we human persons are one per se, by ourselves. We are one in substance and one in form. Eich of us is thus numerically one, as distinct from being specifically one with other human persons, generically one with other animals and other living things, and one by analogy with the order of the universe. Numerical oneness is the starting-point in the analysis of our dignity. We are most one in the sense

that we are a whole, a body-soul unity. The chief consequence of this oneness is that only the person as a whole, and not any part thereof, can truthfully be called a person. Not even a human soul, taken by itself, is a person.

jacques Maritain also sees our oneness or, more correctly, our wholeness as the starting-point of his analysis of human dignity. Much as we are one *per se,* by ourselves, so also we act by ourselves in that we have free choice, or initial liberty. We can either choose, or fail to choose, the various goods, real or apparent, which we see as attaining our good.

On Maritain's view, the way in which the body and soul are united in the human person serves as a model of the person's relationship to the political community. He holds that human persons are wholes by virtue of their spiritual nature; even more, it is by virtue of this spiritual nature that each of us is called a person. According to Maritain, it is this wholeness which enables us to transcend the political community by tending to values which themselves transcend that community. Examples of such values are religious values, justice, and friendship.

In order to account for persons' being parts of something larger than themselves, Maritain states that it is by virtue of our materiality that we are not only persons but also individuals, parts of the social whole. The criticism of Maritain's position centers around the linkage of individuality with being a part. Our materiality certainly constitutes the principle of our individuation, but our individuality is not the same thing as that by which we are individuated. The person, as individual, also forms a whole.

The principal similarity between Maritain's view and that of Aquinas is that the latter identifies human dignity with our rational nature. 'Person' is primarily a theological term; according to Boethius' definition which Aquinas adopts; it signifies an individual substance of a rational nature, whether that natur~ be divine, angelic, or human. 'Person' signifies concrete individuals and not a species. Personhood

(personalitas) is a mode of existing, such that only those substances which have a rational nature are called persons. For Aquinas, the entire human being, body and soul, is a person. When it comes to the dignity proper to human beings, Aquinas situates that dignity in our having a rational nature. The entire person has a rational nature, and the other faculties are ordered to that nature. Our perfection, our being in a complete state, consists of our being a substantial unity of body and soul. Human dignity consists in our ability to understand according to our own mode of understanding. And since "being" (esse) causes "acting" (agere), the fact that we are one kind of being which has a particular ratiomil nature, causes our ability to have dominion over our actions; that is, to act knowingly rather than being entirely dependent on instinct, and to act freely, without being entirely dependent on necessity. This ability to choose freely the means to our good is another point of convergence between Aquinas and Marltain.

#### The common *good*

Every person is a member of some community or other. Every community exists, not for itself, but for some end which is a good. Aristotle sees the city as the highest and most perfect of all communities. And since the proportion of things which are means to an end is the same as the proportion of ends, the good of the city is the highest of all human goods. It is a self-sufficient good in its own order, the order of human affairs. It is that which the members of the political community seek as their end. Aristotle calls it the common advantage: it is what constitutes the political community, and makes the community an end for the families and other groups which compose it. In the political community, this highest human good finds its concrete expression in enabling people to live well: to engage in good actions, and especially to practice justice and friendship.

In developing Aristotle's thought, Aquinas views the political community as something broader than a city-state. In addition to speaking of a city (civitas) composed of families and villages, he also speaks of kingdoms (regna) composed of several cities. These are often called polities or republics (politiae or rei publicae) when they are ruled by several people rather than by one person alone. The broadening of his view also extends to the order of the universe as a common good, and to God as the extrinsic common good of that order. A weakness in Aquinas' position is that he does not make a linkage between the dignity of each person as coming from God, and the rights which come from being a citizen of a political community. Both for Aristotle and for Aquinas, not everyone is automatically a citizen.

For Aquinas, the political common good is but one in an entire order of common goods. It is what is called an intrinsic common good in causando, a final cause, a whole of whi~h each citizen has a part.

In order to be real; the political common good must be concrete: it must involve, for each person, real participation in the life of the community, real input into the decisions which are taken, and real benefits or advantages accruing from this participation.

Charles De Koninck, in his treatment of the primacy of the common good, places the emphasis on the bonds which link each human person with other persons, with the whole of creation, and with God. While agreeing that our dignity has its roots in our understanding and liberty, he stresses that this understanding and liberty can be realized only by the strengthening of our ties with others and with God. He views what he calls our dignity of nature as a perfectly valid starting-point, but only a starting-point. In specifying what he means by the common good, De Koninck underlines his central thesis that the common good, unlike its totalitarian surrogate, strengthens and fosters all aspects of a person's life: family life, involvement in various larger communities, in the political

community, and in the public, communal expression of religion. Totalitarianism, by contrast, reduces all facets of a person's life to that person's belonging to the State, such that the State takes over or else suppresses these other aspects of people's lives. The State, both for Maritain and for De Koninck, is not the same thing as the political community: while the political community is composed of persons, the State is an administrative apparatus designed to serve the community. When, however, it sets itself over against the good of the whole community and of each of its parts, it becomes what ~ Koninck calls a super-individual, imposing itself on weaker individuals.

When we take into consideration this distinction between the State and the political community, we can then understand De Koninck's claim that the person does not transcend the political community. The political community is nothing more and nothing less than a community of persons, families, and intermediate groups. A person cannot transcend a reality made up only of persons. Rather, each person belongs to communities *other than* the political community, and also to God as the highest common good. It is in this sense that the political community does not have a claim on every aspect of a person's life. Furthermore, God's absolute claim on us relativizes every other claim.

Anything which is for the common good allows those aspects of human life which are not the prerogative of the State to flourish and develop. In this sense, De Koninck posits a direct link between the primacy of the common good and the promotion of human dignity. For De Koninck, our share in the common good, rather than our dignity of nature, constitutes the greater part of our dignity. He goes so far as to state that to negate the primacy of the common good, and thus to give priority to those goods which we cannot share with others, amounts to a negation of human dignity itself.

To emphasize the primacy of the common good is also to exalt the dignity of the human person, because the common good is the highest good even of the individual. A cause is potent to the extent that it diffuses itself to several effects. While a private good has only one effect (the individual), the common good extends itself to several effects: it is a higher good precisely because many people can benefit from it.

Humans, among all animals, are alone in being able knowingly to pursue their common good, and to be able to choose between their common good and some private good. This is not to say that other animals act only for their good as individuals and as species; rather, they act *knowingly* only for these goods. One characteristic of beings which have a rational nature is their ability to act knowingly not only for their good as individuals and as species but also for their highest intrinsic, created common good (the order of the universe), and their highest, uncreated, extrinsic common good (God).

While jacques Maritain emphasizes our dignity as deriving from our being a whole, Charles De Koninck views our dignity as consisting in our being a part of something that is "ours" in that it diffuses itself to several effects, of which each of us is one. We have come full circle: the issue at hand is the problem of part and whole. Maritain emphasizes the human person as an organic whole, a being which is both material and spiritual. De Koninck emphasizes our being part of various ordered wholes. The important distinction is that a person is not part of society or of the universe *in the* same *way* as the body or soul is part of a person. I want to show that Maritain's and De Koninck's views are not only complementary, but are indispensable to each other.

#### II. ELEMENTS OF A SYNTHESIS

*Persons as concrete individuals belonging to several communities* 

At this point, it is possible to formulate an account of human persons' relationships to other persons. It is clear by

now that I have rejected the view which holds that persons are abstract, atomized individuals who can be explained completely without any reference to life in common with others. Experience shows that we are by no means pre-social beings who enter into an agreement with others for the sake of the benefits accruing from this agreement. Such a view has as a corollary the idea that non-social existence would be the ideal if it were possible. It is not possible. And I cannot imagine how such an existence could be a happy one even if it were possible.

The view put forward in this dissertation is also a rejection of the opposite extreme: that it is the political community which constitutes the person, defines the nature of the person, and even fashions the "New Man" by the processes of production and consumption. Political regimes come and go, but people remain the same. However much we live in common with others, there is a part of each of us which others cannot claim without degrading us.

Where is the balance to be found between the two extremes just described? I would like to propose a model which, I believe, is a close reflection of experience.

Each of us lives within a series of concentric circles, each of which is a community. The nearest circle, the smallest and most basic, is the family) The family, more than any other community, is the one with which we have the earliest and most immediate contact. Unlike all the other "circles", the family is the one to which we belong permanently. We never leave it, even though we are often separated from other family members.

The next in the series of concentric circles is one's ethnic group.2 This is where we acquire our culture, our way of

<sup>1</sup> By 'family' I mean the clan or extended family, whether natural or adopted.

<sup>2</sup>J have deliberately chosen the expression 'ethnic group' over other alternatives._ The word 'nation', another alternative, is ambiguous in English. It can mean a people with its own culture and traditions, but it can also mean the political coriununity. We refer to Canada as a nation,

seeing the larger world and relating to the world. Unlike one's belonging to a family, the links with one's ethnic heritage are capable of disappearing, together with the language and culture of the group.

Even before there is any mention of a political community, there are yet other communities beyond the family and the ethnic group. These communities can likewise be seen as concentric circles with human persons at the center. Examples are neighborhoods, schools, community groups, businesses, labor unions, service clubs, charitable organizations, and non-governmental organizations. There is no fixed number of examples, and it is possible to invent new kinds of communities. These communities extend beyond the bounds of family and ethnic heritage, and membership in them does not carry with it the same sense of identity as does membership in a family or an ethnic group.

It is only at this point, having gone beyond the concentric circles of intermediate groups, that we deal specifically with various levels of political communities. From the fact that persons already belong to several levels of common life, we see that political communities are not mere unitary entities made up of individuals alone. Such a view is an abstraction: it does not take into account the web of social relationships which make up the concrete existence of each of us. Totalitarianism. whether of the Left or of the Right, is the consequence of the view which sees the collectivity as the only real social relationship, and which destroys all communities. The totalitarian regime is constructed upon atomized individuals. The other extreme ~s anarchy, the negation of the legitimacy of the political community as such. The

yet Canada includes, for example, the First Nations, the Six Nations Reserve, and the (Quebec) National Assembly.

Also, 'race' is not an accurate expression because one can be a full-fledged member of a particular ethnic group through assimilation without being of the same racial origin. It is the group's culture, and not the racial origins of its members, which constitutes an ethnic group.

consequence of this latter view is disorder, the disorganization of public services, where the strong are left at liberty to pursue their own advantage at the expense of the weak. The common .good, on the other hand, demands that the political community respect the dignity of persons as individuals and citizens, as members of families, ethnic groups, and other intermediate groups. The political community's role is to enact laws which guarantee the stability and development of families and of the other levels of communities, and which enable these communities to co-exist harmoniously. If lower levels of communities are unable to provide sufficient help to the poor, the sick, the elderly, and the unemployed, then it is the responsibility of the political community as a whole to provide that. help -- without, however, replacing the contribution which smaller communities are already making. Poverty, unemployment, and other afflictions are threatening to families as well as to individuals; to fall to meet these needs is to threaten the social fabric as a whole. In industrial societies which create a new kind of poverty, the good of the individual has to be assured; it does not exist automatically. Furthermore, the common good demands even more than the assurance of the good of individuals< it consists of the ethical life, and principally of justice, which is a good of all.

Beyond the various levels of political communities, there are also the bonds which exist among countries, and which unite members of different countries. Although international solidarity has undergone considerable progress, it is not yet organized sufficiently for there to be an international community in any real sense. To give but one example, there is no international body with sufficient juridical weight to prevent or halt the outbreak of war.

Where do religious groups fit into this picture? There is a problem with the ancient Greek notion that religious groups are simply another level 9f intermediate group, under the aegis of the political community. When applied to contemporary life, this notion makes the political community the arbiter of religious truth, either by the one extreme of proclaiming an official religion and failing to respect other beliefs, or by the opposite extreme of disregarding religion completely, if not banning its expression. The first extreme holds that religion is a public matter only, and that being fully a member of a political community involves belonging to a particular religious group. The second extreme holds that religion is a private matter only. It fails to take into account the public and social expression and involvement of almost every known religion.

An alternative approach is to hold that religious groups exist for the sake of truths and values which transcend the political community. In order to promote the common good, the political community has the responsibility of allowing all religious groups the freedom to carry out their activities, refraining from interference in matters of belief. At the same time, religious groups have a responsibility to allow the political community to carry out its own proper functions of governance and legislation, refraining from co-opting the political community, or from attempting to collapse the political community into themselves. This approach leaves religious communities and their individual members free, as responsible citizens, to influence public policy and culture. In. particular, it leaves religious leaders free to speak and act publicly in their capacity as leaders, by virtue of their responsibility within the community. This view also leaves the political community free to place restrictions on individuals and groups whose behavior either violates the rights of others or is destructive of social life.

We have, then, a model of social relationships which takes into account the dignity of persons as such, and which also values the ways in which persons relate to one another. On this view, communities have persons at their center, and persons share various aspects of their lives with the other members of the communities to which they belong. The common good, on every level, is the good of communities, a good in which each person has a share.

# Dignity of nature and dignity of finality

In order to make explicit the philosophical underpinnings of the account of social relationships just mentioned, I would like to develop Charles De Koninck's distinction between human persons' dignity of nature and dignity of fmality.

As we have seen, a solution to the problem of part and whole in this context is to be found in the fact that 'part' and 'whole' are analogical. Every human person is an organic whole, and every aspect of our lives is a part with respect to that whole. Each human person is a substantial unum per se, that is, we are, each of us, a substantial unity by ourselves, witp our own act of existence, and we cannot be part of ariother unum per se. Our dignity of nature is to be found in this substantial unity. Maritain emphasizes the dignity of human persons from this point of view, and he is correct as far as he goes.

Charles De Koninck sees more importance in persons' being part of something greater than themselves, and he identifies our dignity of finality as our being ordered to a larger whole. This larger whole, in comparison to the organic wholeness of each person, is different in kind and not merely in degree. Persons are parts of ordered wholes. Unlike organic wholes, ordered wholes do not have their own act of existence; no ordered whole is a substantial unum per se. Only God and singular beings, in different ways, have their own act of existence. Human society on its various levels does not constitute human persons. Rather, each ordered whole is an accidental unum per aliud, the accidents in question being relations. The "other", the aliud by which society is one, is the organic wholeness of those singular beings whose mutual relations give form to that order. The common good of human society, and the intrinsic common good of the order of the universe, have singular beings as their material causes, but these same singular beings are effects with respect to the final

cause which is the common good on its various levels. With regard to God as extrinsic Common Good, it is God who constitutes, by final causality, the community of all things under Himself, all the while being the efficient cause of each singular being's own act of existence.

In speaking of the political community, Aristotle and Aquinas frequently use the comparison between a living or organic whole, and an ordered whole. Nevertheless, these two authors do not fall into the excess of totalitarianism, as has sometimes been claimed. 'Totalitarianism' comes from the contemporary Italian expression *'Stato totalitario'* which signifies a total State, a State which controls everyone and everything. The totalitarian State does not respect citizens' freedom. It pursues, not the common good of citizens, but rather power, governmental apparatus, and ideological uniformity. Instead of vivifying its parts, this State ignores them or even holds them in contempt. The "organic whole" of the ancients is not being called into play here.

In "In Defence of Saint Thomas", Charles De Koninck holds that according to the totalitarian conception, the common good is not that of the members of the political community but of society considered as an individual and a tyrant. In such a case, the State apparatus isolates itself from citizens and, in the name of an ideology, pursues a purely apparent good which is alien to the good of society's members.

When Aristotle and Aquinas compare the political community to organic wholes such as the human body, the organic whole serves only as a comparison. It helps to point out the relationship between the whole and its parts, a relationship which is to be found even in an ordered whole (such as an army, for instance). The resemblance exists on the level of operation. As Aquinas puts it, just as a foot cannot carry out its function separated from the body (the foot is an organic part of the body), so a soldier cannot carry out his mission when he is isolated or separated from the army of which he is a part (a part of an ordered whole). The

relationship between these two kinds of whole is the same from the point of view of operation or power) The citizen is compared to a soldier in that he or she is called to act justly by the civil order. Aquinas does not confuse organic and ordered wholes, but rather he makes use of the resemblance which exists between them.

As far as Charles De Koninck is concerned, he compares, not person and society as alien entities, but the good of the person and the good of society as distinct yet partly inclusive goods. The good of the whole has the good of persons as its parts, when 'whole' means an ordered whole. But each person has a share in the common good as part of him- or herself, when 'whole' refers to the organic wholeness of each person. That is why, on De Koninck's view, each person has a part of the common good as his or her highest proper good, all the while being part of the social whole.

To probe the relationship between the dignity of the human person and the common good, is to probe the relationship between our dignity of nature and our dignity of finality. As we have seen in Chapter Four, our dignity of nature involves our being masters of our own actions. By deliberation and decision, we are able to choose the means of achieving our end. Our end is our dignity of fmality: to live a moral life in common with others, and to know and love the ultimate end of the universe, which is God. What is distinct about beings with rational natures is that we are capable of moving toward this end knowingly. This does not mean that we always do so, but we have that capacity within us. If that capacity is to be realized, then, by choice, we give primacy to those goods which we share with others rather than to those goods which belong to each of us alone. If we do not move ourselves toward our dignity of fmality, however, this does not alter our dignity of nature, but it frustrates the realization of those dispositions which are part of that nature. By nature we

I st. Thomas Aquinas, In I Pol. I, 1, 38.

are disposed to share in common with other persons, with all of nature, and with God. Our greater dignity, our dignity of finality, is to be found in the realization of that *communicatio.*  Dignity of nature relates to dignity of finality as principle to term. The dignity which is ours by nature is, from our point of view, our starting-point in human action. Our dignity of finality, our share in the common good on all its levels, is the term of human action.

It was mentioned above that the accidental unity of the parts of an organic whole is that of relation. What kind of relation is this? Specifically, what is that relation by which a person is part of society? Jacques Maritain's answer to the question is that a person's corporeality is that by which the person is a part of a larger whole. We have already seen the difficulties with this view. There is yet another answer to the question. The relation by which a person is part of a larger whole is that of friendship: friendship understood in the broad sense which Aristotle describes. It is friendship which unites husband and wife, which unites families, all other groups in society, as well as political communities themselves. Even though it is not possible to love any more than a few. people for their own sake, it is indeed possible for a whole society to have friendship for the sake of utility, to come together in agreement over common tasks. Once it is decided what the common good consists of in a particular context, and once people agree on the means to achieve that good, they share in common the projects involved in realizing that good. All levels of friendship, finally, have in common the characteristic that they presume the existence of justice, both commutative and distributive.

#### III. SOME APPLICATIONS TO HUMAN RIGHTS

1. The divisions of human rights according *to* the divisions of bonumsuum

At two different points in this dissertation, it was mentioned that a "missing link" in the analysis was an approach to human rights. At the end of Chapter Three, I said that in order to link the dignity of the human person and the political common good, one needs to affirm that a person must be automatically recognized as a citizen of a particular political community, with all the rights which flow from this status. Merely to say that a person has dignity by his or her nature is not enough. That dignity must be recognized publicly and protected by law. And at the end of Chapter Four, I noted that although Charles De Koninck's treatment of the primacy of the common good surely implies an important role for human rights, these rights are not mentioned explicitly in his text. In this last section, I shall endeavor to fill in this gap, giving particular attention to the development of De Koninck's thought on the subject later in his career. This is not intended to be a complete theory of human rights, and even less a catalogue of rights. I intend, rather, to determine what can be said of human rights on the basis of what has already been formulated in this dissertation.

The previous section ended with the statement that friendship, which holds all levels of human society together, presumes the existence ·of justice. I shall use Aquinas' definition of justice as a starting-point for an explanation of human rights. Aquinas states, "Justice is the habit according to which someone, by a firm and stable will, gives to each and every person what is his or her right." 1 Rights are those things which people, either individually or collectively, are obliged

166

<sup>1</sup>ST, Ila Ilae, 58, 1, c. "(I)ustitia est habitus secundum quem aliquis constanti et perpetua voluntate ius suum unicuique tribuit."

out of justice to give to others. When seen from the point of view of the recipients, real or potential, these things are rights. When seen from the point of view of those obliged to give them, the giving of these things constitutes a duty. There are thus three elements in the definition: the persons who claim certain things, the persons from whom they are claimed, and the things themselves. I

But what are these rights and duties? Their content is not specified in the definition. The relationship between justice and friendship should give us a clue. Friendship, we recall, is founded on a sharing in common of the means chosen to attain the common good. And friendship can exist only if there is also justice. Now the object of justice is the equitable distribution of all that constitutes means to the attainment of one's good, whether private or common. It is these means, these intermediate goods, which are the content of justice, and which constitute what is shared in common in friendship. These intermedia~e goods, then, are also the content of rights and duties. Human rights are *means,* the minimal conditions for the pursuit of the common good. The common good cannot be realized if there is no friendship. There can be no friendship if there is no justice. And there can be. no justice if people's rights are not recognized. If, however, people's rights are recognized, then this makes justice possible. Where there is justice, friendship is possible. And where there is friendship, there is the pursuit of the common good.

Another formulation of the content of rights is to say that rights have as their content the proper good of the persons who hold those rights. 'Proper good', we recall, is the generic expression for each person's own good (bonum suum), whether that good be private or shared with others. If we are to

<sup>1</sup> There is also need for the strength of a sanction structured by positive law in order to enssure the effectiveness of the right which is being recognized. Such a need is, at most, implicit in the Thomitsic definition of justice. See Jean Rivero, "Vers de nouveaux droits de l'homme" *Revue des sciences morales et politiques.* 4 (1982), 676.

understand the various divisions of rights, it is helpful to understand the various divisions of each person's proper good. We recall that

the proper good of anything can be taken in many ways:

1. In that it is proper to that thing as an individual. And thus an animal desires its good in that it desires food, by which it is preserved in being.

2. In that it is [its good] as species. _ And thus an animal desires its proper good inasmuch as it desires the generation and feeding of offspring, or anything else it does to preserve and defend the individuals of its species.

3. As genus. And thus an analogous agent desires its proper good by way of causation ... [The order of the universe is covered under this heading.]

4. As a similarity of analogy of effects to their principle. And thus God, who is outside any genus, gives being to all things for the sake of his own good.l

First, let us take the good as proper to each person as an individual. This vantage point can form the basis for a reinterpretation of what have traditionally been called individual rights. Examples include the right to life at all its stages; to adequate employment, food, clothing, shelter, and health care; and to the security of the person.2 In light of what

<sup>2</sup>None of th,e lists of rights which I shall give is intended to be exhaustive. Rather, they are examples to illustrate the divisions of rights of which I am speaking. I do not intend to decide the question of

has been said up to now, it would be a mistake to interpret these rights as those of individuals imagined as living independently of life in common with others. Rather, it is human persons in their entirety, in all the concrete circumstances of their lives, who are the holders of rights. Individual rights, then, are the rights of persons from a particular point of view; they are the rights which have as their content the proper good of persons inasmuch as these persons are individuals as distinct from members of a species. just as persons as individuals desire their proper good in that they desire whatever preserves them in existence, so individual rights have as their content whatever preserves people in existence. They are not the rights of individuals envisaged in opposition to groups, for the persons themselves compose those groups. Rather, they are the rights of persons as singular beings as distinct , from those same persons as members of groups.

The next division of rights has as its content the proper good which a person seeks as a part of the human species; in other words, it includes the common good of families, of all intermediate groups, of the political community, and of the human species. These rights include our being part of every level of human society, beginning with the family. Examples of such rights include the right to marry; to found a family; and to have access to all that is necessary for the feeding, education, and upbringing of children. This group of rights also includes the right to participate in cultural and political life, and the right to freedom of association and expression, as well as the right to freedom from discrimination. It is to be noted that freedom of association and expression and freedom from discrimination are not listed under individual rights. *All* rights are the rights of persons; some of these rights are those of persons as individuals, others are the rights of persons as members of communities. Freedom of expression, of

where to draw the line as to which claims are to be recognized as rights. That would be the topic of a dissertation in itself.

association, as well as the right to strike, -.,. all these freedoms presume a whole set of social relationships. These freedoms are rights of persons, but these rights can be exercised only collectively. They are made effective by the voluntary agreement of several persons. Freedom of expression, for instance, does not exist in a vacuum: we express our ideas and convictions *to* others and *about* ourselves or others. Thus, just as the person cannot rightly be conceived as existing in isolation from others, so freedom of expression cannot rightly be conceived as existing in isolation from social responsibility. For example, the propagation of hatred must not be protected in the name of freedom of expression. Similarly, freedom from discrimination governs a series of social relationships, from the wo~kplace to the political community. Such rights seek to guarantee persons' full participation in the life of these societies, by guaranteeing the removal of barriers to that participation.

The holders of the next group of rights are human persons, not as members of the human species, but as members of the ensemble of all species. They include, in other words, persons' relationship to the environment. Once again, it is human persons who are the holders of these rights. As for the content of these rights, this could be considered as the right to live in a safe and healthy environment, and the responsibility not to abuse that environment. These rights can be seen as the basis, for example, for laws which impose penalties on those who pollute the environment. There are other examples, but the point is that human persons live not only with other human persons; there is also an interdependence among species, an interdependence of which we have become more aware in recent decades.

The holders of the final group of rights are persons inasmuch as we are ordered to God as our ultimate, extrinsic common good. This is the group of rights which concern freedom of_religion, or, more precisely, persons' freedom from coercion in matters of religious belief and expression. More

will be said about this in the subsection dealing with De Koninck's treatment of the subject.

# 2. Comparison with the "generations" of human rights

The schema of human rights which I have just formulated is quite different from the so-called generations of human rights which have developed since the eighteenth century. The schema just formulated identifies concrete individuals, in their various social relationships, as the holders of human rights. The "three generations", by contrast, identify two groups of right-holders: persons as individuals (first- and second-generation rights) and collectivities as distinct from the persons who compose them (third-generation rights). Some explanation is in order.

The first generation, as formulated in the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (to name only the first two declarations), are generally referred to as political or civil rights. They conceive rights as liberties, as freedom from coercion by the State apparatus. Examples are the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; to equality before the law, to property, to the security of the person, to resistance to oppression; to freedom of opinion and its expression within the bounds of public order. By their nature, they call for the State's refraining from intervention in people's lives, conceived as the private domain of each individual.

The second generation of rights, which finds its fullest expression in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), have been commonly referred to as economic or social rights. Their aim is to make it possible for people to exercise that liberty which the first generation of rights is designed to protect. Like the rights of the first generation, they are individual rights in the sense that their object is the exercise of individual liberty and initiative. The difference is that the rights of the second generation are

intended to secure goods which individuals cannot procure alone, and which they claim from the State. Examples are the rights to social security; to secure employment with equitable remuneration; to the formation of or adhesion to labor unions; to adequate housing, health care, and education. While the first-generation rights demand the State's abstention or withdrawal from the private sphere of individuals' lives, the second-generation rights demand positive involvement on the part of the State.

The 1948 Declaration has been supplemented by many subsequent Pacts: those adopted in 1966 by the United Nations for the effective protection of human rights, and the Conventions for the struggle against genocide and for the elimination of racial discrimination, to name but two. On the continental level, there have been various regional Pacts: the European Convention on human rights and fundamental liberties ( 1950), and the Inter-American Convention on human rights (1969).1

Since the 1980's, there has been discussion of a third generation of rights, which have been called rights of peoples, or solidarity rights.2 Examples include the rights of peoples to self-determination, the right to peace, and to a safe environment. The list is ever-increasing, and there is much controversy over whether these can in fact be considered as rights, or whether they ought more fittingly to be called objectives or ideals. Simone Goyard-Fabre goes so far as to speak of "fundamental rights gone adrift" *(la derive des droits* 

I see Rivero, op. cit., p. 6 7 4. The sources used in this subsection originally formed part of the reading material for the course, Droits et libertes de la personne, taught by Prof. Luc Begin at Universite Laval, Fall1990.

<sup>2</sup>The expression 'solidarity rights' is that of Paul Sieghart, who sees collective rights as an instance of "precisely the sentiment against which the entire canon of modern human rights law is meant to provide a protective bulwark." Paul Sieghart, The Lawful Rights of Mankind (Oxford, 1985), p. 164, quoted by Michael McDonald, "The Forest in the_ Trees: Collective Rights as Basic Rights" in Guy Lafrance, ed., Ethique et droits fondamentaux, (Ottawa: Les Presses de l'Universite d'Ottawa, 1989), p. 231.

fondamentaux).l Who are the holders who can claim the recognition of these rights? Who are the people from whom these rights are being claimed? Is it possible to have an effective sanction in positive law, such that the goods claimed can pass from the ideal to the real? I shall address these questions in the next subsection.

In order to understand some of the philosophical problems underlying the relationship among the three generations of rights, it is helpful to note one of the historical forces which shaped the development of the modern understanding of rights. Guy Haarscher states that human rights are a reaction to two absolutisms: the divine-right absolutism of the Ancien Regime, and that of modern totalitarianism which, in the name of a non-religious and sometimes militantly atheistic world-view, contests any reference to private life. In response to both absolutisms, the philosophy of human rights seeks to place limits on the power of the State apparatus, and it is a reaction against the farreaching legitimation of power.2 It is a reaction to the absorption, for whatever motive, of private life into the sphere of State control. The reaction takes the form of an individualistic understanding of the person. As Haarscher puts it:

> Power ... will be called legitimate if it respects a certain number of prerogatives granted to the individual *as*  individual. In other words, the individual, with his or her rights, constitutes the goal of political association .... 3

Isimone Goyard-Fabre, "La derive des droits fondamentaux", in Guy Lafrance, ed., *Ethique et droits fondamentaux,* (Ottawa: Les Presses de l'Universite d'Ottawa, 1989), pp. 61-71.

<sup>2</sup>Guy Haarscher, *Philosophie des droits de l'homme,* (Bruxelles: Les Editions de l'Universie de Bruxelles, 1987), p. 11.

*<sup>3</sup>Jbid.,* p. 12. "(L)e pouvoir ... sera dit legitime s'il respecte un certain nombre de prerogatives accordees a l'individu *comme tel.* En d'autres termes, l'individu, avec ses droits, constitue le but de !'association politique .... "

When one considers that public life, in many countries, has so often been experienced as an invasion of persons' freedom, it is not surprising that the primary or fundamental sense of rights is seen as the rights of individuals over against the State apparatus. The problem is that this view of person and society does not address the relationship of persons to the various communities to which they belong. The problem is aggravated when "society" is understood as a reality alien to the persons who compose it, and when the political community, as a community of persons, is confused with the administrative apparatus of the State.

The problems associated with synthesizing the various generations of rights are directly related to the confusion in understanding the relationship between persons as individuals, and persons as members of communities. Nowhere is the confusion of more consequence, and nowhere is there a greater need for a cohesive vision of person and community, than in the debate concerning individual rights and collective rights.

#### 3. Individual rights and collective rights

I am using the expression 'collective rights' as a generic expre~sion to designate two different kinds of rights. The first is those individual rights which can be exercised only in common with others, on the basis of agreement with others. An example is the right of parents to establish a school. The right to educate one's children is a right of which each parent is a holder, but this right can be exercised only if parents join together and establish a school.

The second group of rights designated by the expression 'collective rights' is the rights of peoples or of collectivities. The so-called third-generation rights have, as their subject, a people, the State, or a group. They are economic and cultural rights, or the right of a people to self-determination. They concern the relationships among groups as groups. These rights -- the· right to development, to peace, to the free

exchange of information -- are indispensable for the promotion of the rights of persons. My intent, in this subsection, is to argue that although the rights of peoples are rights of collectivities properly so called, each member of the collectivity has a share in the exercise of those rights. It is for this reason, I shall argue, that the rights of peoples can be deferided as rights in the classical sense.

A major difference between the two groups is that the legal sanctions which guarantee the former are to be found in the laws of a particular political community. The latter group, however, concerns the relations of political communities among themselves, and the proper locus of their legal standing is international law.

In this subsection, my remarks apply interchangeably to both groups of rights.

The good of each person, we recall, has two main divisions. There is the private good of that person, a good which can be called the good of that person as individual, and which has as its content what is necessary for preserving that person in existence. The second division consists of those goods which persons share with others. I have argued that the person relates to the common good as point of departure to point of arrival, and that the highest good of each person is that person's share in the common good on its various levels. How does one relate this schema to the debate between individual rights and collective rights? Do individual rights protect the private good of persons, while collective rights protect the common good of a community and of each of its members? It is not that simple. In particular, if one regards human persons as entities alienated from the communities, now called collectivities, to which they belong, then there will be major problems in reconciling individual rights and collective rights. If, however, we can show that each member of a group has a share in the good protected by a collective right, then it will be possible to formulate a linkage between

individual rights and collective rights. I intend to argue for the necessity of such a linkage.

Let us look more closely at collective rights, drawing upon a recent defense of them by Michael McDonald.! McDonald's approach to rights in general is as follows:

> With rights as with the other parts of the normative repertoire (e.g., duties, ideals, interests, and values), we look first to the evils they are designed to avoid and the goals they are intended to procure. Thus, in law, a principal role of statutory interpretation is to consider the mischief the statute is designed to remedy.2

There are two ways in which rights procure goals and avoid various kinds of mischief:

> (a) they put the rightholder in command of a particular situation, and (b) they secure the rightholder's interest. Standardly, (a) is secured by (b). So as a Canadian citizen my having mobility rights under the Charter [of Rights and Freedoms] (Section 6) secures my interest (b) in freedom of movement by (a) giving me access to certain constitutionally guaranteed legal procedures against those who do or would interfere with my mobility."3

In light of the example of mobility rights which McDonald gives, it would be more correct to say "(a) secures (b)", or "(b) is secured by (a)." The goal of any right is to secure the interest of the rightholder. 'Interest' can be taken to mean the advantage or the good of the rightholder. In relation to this goal of securing the rightholder's interest, the means, on McDonald's view, are the constitutional or legal procedures against those who would deprive the rightholder of that

1 Michael McDonald, "The Forest in the Trees: Collective Rights as Basic Rights" in Guy Lafrance, ed. Ethique et droits fondamentaux, (Ottawa: Les Presses de l'Universite d'Ottawa, 1989), pp. 230-241. 2 Ibid., p. 232. 3Jbid.

interest. Collective rights, in this framework, have groups as their holders, and their goal is to secure the collective interest of the group.

Collective rights are intended to protect a group's existence, identity, and interests. This requires that the groups have institutions and means of expression. They also require that the group determine what its collective interest (common good?) consists of. Examples which McDonald gives are places of worship for religious groups, a land base for aboriginal groups, and promotion of a language and culture for a linguistic minority.

McDonald contends that collective rights are those of the group as group; they are not the rights of each member of the group. The reason is that the collective benefits which these rights procure cannot be collapsed into the benefit of each member of the group:

> Consider ... the team that wins the most games in, say, the National Hockey League playoffs. In this case, the collective benefit is the Stanley Cup. The benefit is a team benefit; among other things, its possession proclaims that this is the best team this year. While this suggests that the individual team members, e.g. Wayne Gretzky, are of high quality, it does not entail that they are the best in the League. A corollary of this is that the collective good is not necessarily the sum of the interests of the group's members.!

I would like to nuance McDonald's stance by applying to it some of the conclusions which I have drawn in this dissertation. It is true that the common good of a team cannot be collapsed into the goods of its individual members, if'goods' are taken to mean private goods, those goods which belong to each individual alone. And I agree that a team's winning the Stanley Cup is a victory for the team as a group, as a whole. It does not follow, however, that the victory is that of the whole

<sup>1</sup> Ibid. , p. 235.

as separate from its parts. Each player on the team has a share in the good of winning the Stanley Cup. The prize is an honor for the team as a whole, but it is an honor of which each member has a proportionate share. I think McDonald is avoiding such a conclusion because he understands the share in a common good as necessarily an arithmetical share. He writes, earlier on, "My owing the Ottawa Department of Philosophy \$30 is not the same as owing each of its 30 members \$1." 1 Fair enough. A team's winning the Stanley Cup does not mean that each member made an arithmetically identical contribution to the victory. It remains the case, however, that the victory of the team redounds to each of the team's members. Each member has a proportionate share in the victory, in that each member contributed to it in a way different from other team members' contributions. Furthermore, the good which is a share in the victory, is a higher good for each player than, say,

to be named among the top three players of a particular game (i.e., a private good). It is a greater honor for a player to be on the winning team than to be the top player on the losing team.

Now, it is generally agreed that the end or goal of collective rights is to secure a collective good. If this collective good is understood as separate from the good of each member of the group, then it cannot truthfully be called the common good. It is a good alien to the persons who make up the collectivity, and consequently the rights which are intended to secure this good are alien to the rights of each member of the group. If, however, the good of the collectivity is understood as a good in which each member of the group has a share, then it is true to say that collective rights, on this construal of them, secure a common good. Much as individual rights are intended to secure the good of persons as individuals, collective rights ought to be understood as securing the good of persons as ·. members of a community. These rights secure the advantages accruing from being part of a community. On such an account

lJbid. , p. 234.

of collective rights, it is persons who are the holders of these rights, just as it is persons who are the holders of individual rights. The difference lies in the formality according to which the person is being understood: either as individual or as part of a larger whole. Also, the exercise of collective rights presumes the agreement of several people. To understand collective rights in this way is not, to use McDonald's words, individualist reductionism!, because it is not the private goods of individuals which these rights are intended to secure; rather, the purpose of these rights is to secure the good of a community, a good of which each member has a share as his or her *bonum suum.* By maintaining persons as the holders of collective rights, one can defend collective rights as rights in the classical sense. The good of a person as individual, and the good of a person as member of a community, are both goods of one and the same person; it is possible to distinguish these goods, but not to separate them. And thus the rights which are intended to secure each of these goods cannot be separated either, even though they can be distinguished one from another. Both kinds ofrights must be recognized if the rights of the whole person are to be recognized. None of this is a denial of collective agency in legal procedures2; it is, rather an affirmation that a common good cannot be separated from the good of each person who is part of that community.

Collective rights, then, do not, on every account of them, serve as means of pursuing the common good. They are presupposed in the pursuit of the common good. The common good is the good of the whole society and of each of its parts; i.e., of all persons who compose that society. Thus, collective rights promote the common good to the extent that each person in that society is a holder of those rights, and to the extent that their exercise fosters social harmony and balance.

l[bid. 2 Ibid., p. 238.

The primacy of the common good over private goods implies the importance of collective rights if and only if due protection is given to individual rights. The person's share in the common good is, as I have already shown in this dissertation, the highest proper good of that person. Individual rights, although not a sufficient condition for the promotion of the common good, are nonetheless a necessary condition. Without them, we cannot even begin to promote the common good. And without the protection of collective rights, there is no protection of persons' share in the common good. There must, in other words, be a recognized linkage of individual and collective rights, a linkage which has the force of juridical sanction either in positive law or in constitutional guarantees.

#### 4. Charles De Koninck on human rights

In 1964, one year before his untimely death, Charles ~ Koninck published Tout homme est mon prochain, a collection of essays, talks, and interviews dating from the early 1940's to 1963. The individual pieces are of an occasional nature, and there is therefore no systematic treatment of human rights as such. In a number of pieces, however, De Koninck develops his thought on freedom of consciences, even of erroneous consciences. This discussion deals with two rights in particular: the right of parents to choose the kind of schools their children are to attend, and the right of all persons to be free from coercion in matters of religious belief and expression. At the risk of taking De Koninck's remarks out of context, I shall present the kernel of his thinking on these two subjects, with some commentary.

Even before De Koninck speaks of the rights of parents in the choice of their children's schooling, he speaks first of the rights of the children themselves to an education. By 'education', he does not mean only instruction or schooling- the ordinary meaning we usually give the word in English. He means, rather, the moral and other forms of training which parents give their children. Rather than emphasizing the education which children receive at school, he ep1phasizes the education which they receive at the most tender age, even before the children are CQnscious of the fact that they are being trained or educated. It is in this context that De Koninck speaks of children's rights to an education I:

> This initial formation is so important that Aristotle and St. Thomas go so far as to say that it will be almost impossible, for the child who has become an adult, to act virtuously if he or she has not been trained, from the earliest age, to love the beautiful and the good, to reject the ugly and the bad. It is a matter, in short, of educating by example, by discipline and exhortation, well before school age or the age of reason. The rights of the child, who is the common good of his or her family, go far beyond the mere right to food, clothing, · and shelter. These are obviously of utmost necessity. And yet they give way, as secondary rights, to the child's primary right to an authentic upbringing (education) right from the beginning of life.2

Schooling is part of a child's education, but only a part. When De Koninck speaks of parents' right to choose the kind of school

<sup>1</sup> Perhaps 'upbringing' would be a more accurate translation of the French word *'education'.* 

<sup>2</sup>Charles De Koninck, "L'importance de !'education avant l'age de raison" (1960) in *Tout homme est man prochain,* (Quebec: Les Presses de l'Universite Laval, 1964), pp. 33f. "Cette formation initiale est tellement importante qu'Aristote et saint Thomas vont jusqu'a affirmer qu'il sera a peu pres impossible, pour !'enfant devenu adulte, de pratiquer la vertu, s'il n'a pas ete entraine des le plus bas age a aimer le beau et le bien, a rejeter le laid et le mal. Il s'agit en somme d'une education par l'exemple, par la discipline et !'exhortation, tout a fait anterieure a l'age scolaire ou l'age de raison. Les droits de !'enfant, lequel est le bien commun de sa famille, depassent de loin le simple droit ala nourriture, le vetement et l'abri. Ceux-ci sont evidemment de toute necessite, et cependant le cedent, comme des droits seconds, au droit premier de !'enfant a une education authentique des le debut de sa vie."

<sup>[</sup>All pieces quoted in this subsection are taken from the same volume. Subsequent references will include the name of the essay, talk, or interview; the year in which it was composed; and the page(s) on which the reference is found in the volume.]

which their children are to attend, this right must be understood as part of a broader right to give their children an upbringing according to the dictates of their consciences, even when their consciences are in error as to what, in a particular instance, constitutes the "beautiful and the good", "the ugly and the bad".

This right to give an education, in the broad sense, to one's children is a natural right; that is, it is prior to any rights of the State in this regard.l De Koninck is careful to point out that this does not mean that parents' rights over their children are arbitrary. Their right to give an education to their children is subordinate to natural and divine law. Nevertheless, the exercise of this right inevitably involves lacunae and shortcomings, but these lacun~e do not entail the suppression of this right. With Aquinas (ST, Ila IIae, 10, 12), De Koninck maintains that it would be against natural justice for a child under the age of reason to be taken out of the care of his or her parents, or to be handled against the parents' will in any way whatsoever. In another place, De Koninck makes it clear that he recognizes the exceptions to this rule:

> Assuredly, it happens that even there, there are circumstances where an intervention on the part of political society is indispensable: when parents show that they are totally irresponsible or positively harmful; either when they deny food, shelter, or education to the child; or when they brutalize the child outright. For that is precisely the other way of doing violence to nature [i.e., other than denying parents' natural right to educate their children].2

<sup>1</sup>De Koninck, "Droits et devoits des parents en matiere d'education" ( 1962), p. 59.

<sup>2</sup>Jbid., p. 64. "Assurement, il se trouve encore lades circonstances oil une intervention de la societe politique est indispensable -- quand Ies parents se revelent totalement irresponsables ou positivement nocifs, soit qu'ils <lenient nourriture, asile, education a !'enfant, soit que proprement ils le brutalisent. Car precisement c'est !'autre fa<;:on de faire violence a la nature."

There are, to be sure, extreme instances such as child abuse which constitute exceptions to this rule of non-interference. They are exceptions, however, precisely because of the extremity of the circumstances.

The requirement that the upbringing be according to divine law needs some qualification if it is not to be misunderstoOd. While invincible ignorance is not acceptable as an excuse for the transgression of positive law, it does excuse the transgression of divine law. And even if it did not, this would still not be a matter within the competence of the State. The protection of children's lives and safety is a good which the State has the right, even the duty, to impose, but the adoption of a particular religion is a good which no one has the right to impose.l

The arguments put forward by De Koninck provide an example both of the autonomy of the political community, and of the limits of its competence. The principle from which his arguments are formulated is that parents, and not the political community as a whole, have the primary responsibility for the education of children. The immediate family circle, in the education of children, takes precedence over the broader circle of the political community. The political community intervenes only in extreme circumstances when the parents are grossly negligent of the child's basic needs. Nor does the political community have the competence to intervene in the affairs of that broader circle which is religious groups, except in extreme circumstances where the behavior of these groups threatens the political common good. The political community, then, is

<sup>1</sup> If we hold, from a theological point of view, that faith is a gift, then what is a gift of God to some, cannot be imposed as a law for all.

This latter statement is sometimes used to defend the exclusion of any mention of abortion from the Criminal Code. The dignity of unborn human life, however, is not something knowable by Divine Revelation alone. It is a matter of natural morality even before being a matter of religious belief. Otherwise, people of no religious convictions would not be able to recognize the dignity of human life prior to birth. The fact that they can and often do, suggests that we are not dealing primarily with a theological issue.

responsible for its own sphere, the political common good. With some exceptions, it does not have the competence to intervene in the smaller communities which compose it, or in the broader communities which pursue truths and values which transcend the political realm.

On the relationship between freedom of consciences I, or freedom of an invincibly erroneous conscience, and the political common good, De Koninck writes:

> Freedom of consciences, and freedom of the invincibly erroneous subjective conscience, are essential to the common good of society. Without them, and so long as they do not enter into conflict with the laws of society, political life and citizenship would be quite simply impossible: public power would be despotic and thus the very opposite of political power. For it is incumbent upon a citizen to. act by him- or herself and to be, in this sense, *causa sui;* a citizen, by definition, possesses the power to contradict. That is the whole difference between political power and tyranny.Z

To say that freedom of consciences must not enter into conflict with the laws of society presupposes that the laws themselves are not grossly unjust; that is, that they are truly laws:

I I am using the expression 'freedom of consciences' instead of 'freedom of conscience' in order to avoid confusion. Each of us, as an individual, has an obligation to follow his or her conscience, and also to form his or her conscience. In this sense, our conscience is not free. But the political community has an obligation to allow citizens to seek the truth according to their best lights. In this sense, there must be freedom of consciences, in that consciences must be kept free from coercion.

Sans elles, et tant qu'elles n'entrent pas en conflit avec les lois de la societe, la vie politique et la citoyennete seraient tout simplement impossibles: le pouvoir public serait despotique et done !'oppose meme d'un pouvoir politique. Car il incombe au citoyen d'agir par lui-meme et d'etre en ce sens *causa sui;* il jouit, par definition, de la puissance de contredire. C'est toute la differance entre la societe politique et la tyrannie."

ordinances of reason for the common good, promulgated by those who have the care of the community.!

Applying this principle of freedom of consciences to the rights of parents to receive State support for their choice of schools (confessional or non-confessional), DeKoninck specifies that freedom of consciences is not a mere concession to a de facto pluralistic society. Rather, it is a positive good which protects the freedom of the act of faith. It is a sign of the respect due to the way in which people learn fundamental truths even ofthe purely natural order:

> It is this same [respect] which is ignored by States which recognize and support only those schools where religion is unknown or ignored. In a truly political State (as opposed to a despotic one), I do not have to be an agnostic in order to recognize the rights of agnostics, and the State which -does recognize the rights of agnostics, does not thereby espouse agnosticism. On the other hand, the State would cease to be political and would become despotic if it supported only non-confessional schools.2

It is persons who are the holders of rights. Beliefs are not holders of rights. Thus, when a political community recognizes the rights of a person, this does not imply that the community is conferring rights on that person's beliefs. When the political community recognizes, for example, the rights of Christians or jews, this does not imply that the community is professing Christianity or judaism; nor is the community committing itself to agnosticism when it recognizes the rights of agnostics. As far as schools are concerned, schools of various kinds are not

"C'est encore elle qui est meconnue par les Etats ne reconnaissant et n'appuyant que les ecoles oil la religion est ignoree. Dans un Etat veritablement politique (par opposition a despotique) je ne dois pas etre agnostique pour reconnaitre les droits des agnostiques, et l'Etat qui fait de meme n'epouse point du coup l'agnosticisme. Par contre, l'Etat cesserait d'etre politique et deviendrait despotique s'il n'appuyait que les ecoles non confessionnelles."

the official organ of the State; they are the extension of the exercise of parents' right to educate their children. State subsidies to the educational system amount to assistance to parents in their exercise of this right. If this assistance were lacking, many parents would simply not be able to exercise their rights as far as their children are concerned. Once again, government assistance to schools which espouse a particular world-view, religious or otherwise, does not imply the conferral of rights upon that world-view. In this case, it is the parents, and not the parents' beliefs, which are the holders of rights. The political community is not the arbiter of truths which transcend it.

Related to the issue of schooling is the right to freedom from coercion in matters of religious belief and expression.

De Koninck distinguishes between doctrinal intolerance and civil intolerance.! It belongs to religious bodies to pose as conditions for membership the adherence to certain teachings on faith and morals. It does not follow that civil society has that same prerogative. If a society poses as a condition for citizenship the adherence to a particular religion, then that society violates not only natural justice but also Christian faith itself. By its very nature, religious faith, at least within the Judaeo-Christian tradition, requires a free act on the part of a person. If a society respects the fact that adherence to a religion must be without constraint, then that so~iety is respecting the means by which people come to adhere to truth.

De Koninck grounds his treatment of the subject upon *benignitas,* or benignity. In social relations, I must be benign toward people who are in error. Their rights do not amount to the right of error, but the right to assent to truth according to one's best lights, with the consequence that one is often mistaken.

lDe Koninck, "La benignite du chretien" (1962), p. 44.

De Koninck takes the question one step further. Leaving aside the issue of faith as a gift which one accepts freely, does civil society have a right to impose, as a condition for citizenship, the adherence to truths which we would call natural religiqn (e.g., the existence of God, the immortality of the soul) ?1 In response, De Koninck remarks that, by the aid of reason alone, it is very difficult to come to a clear understanding of such truths, and that it is even impossible for the great majority of people. Since this is the case, one can, in all good faith, be unable to adhere to these truths. It follows that, for the truths of natural religion also, civil society must respect the means by which people arrive at the knowledge of truth, whether natural or supernatural.

None of this militates against a society's being publicly ordered to God. Any constitution must have, as a foundation for its authority, a principle which transcends the constitution itself. If it did not, then the constitution would be arbitrary. The respect for freedom of consciences does not, in other words, amount to a public endorsement of agnosticism. As ~ Koninck puts it, "The State which would oblige me to behave publicly as an agnostic would show itself to be just as intolerant as the State which would force me to be Christian."2 A society would usurp its authority if it placed constraint upon people's convictions on difficult questions. It would be lacking in respect not only for persons but also for the truth itself. ~ Koninck sums up: "It is the person who has rights, notwithstanding his or her ignorance and errors touching upon fundamental truths. In short, the State has no licence to promote hypocrisy."3

<sup>1</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 46.

*<sup>2</sup>Ibid.,* p. 47. "L'Etat qui m'obligerait a me comporter publiquement en agnostique se revelerait aussi intolerant que l'Etat qui me forcerait a etre Chretien.".

<sup>3</sup> *Ibid.,* p. 48. "Ce qui a des droits, c'est Ia personne, nonobstant son ignorance, ses erreurs touchant les questions fondamentales. L'Etat n'a point licence, en somme, de promouvoir l'hypocrisie."

#### IV. CONCLUSION

The relationship of the dignity of the human person to the common good can be described variously as a relationship of starting-point to point of arrival, of principal to term, of *terminus a quo* to *terminus ad quem.* This relationship is not one of contrariety of the individual to the political community; it is, rather, the good of the individual's being completed and realized by the common good. While contrariety is an opposition within the same subject, the relationship of *terminus a quo* to *terminus ad quem* involves the movement of one and the same subject from its natural perfection to its final perfection. This movement, for us, is human action: ethical behavior for the sake of our final happiness or felicity. The pursuit of the common good is human action carried out to attain that good, the good of each one of us, which no person can attain by him- or herself.

Human rights, whether individual or collective, secure goods which persons, again either individually or collectively, have a duty to give to others. These goods, whether they be private goods or common goods, are the minimum requirements of distributive justice. By effective sanctions in positive law, rights guarantee access to those goods the sharing of which is the foundation of civic friendship. In this sense, human rights are means to the pursuit of the common good. The holders of rights are invariably human persons, whether as individuals or as members of communities. In order to protect the rights of the whole person, the political community has a duty to link the protection of individual rights with the protection of collective rights.

What about situations where there is an apparent conflict between the good of one person (or of a group) and the good of the political community as a whole? It must be kept in mind that the common good, by definition, is not a *bonum alienum,* an alien good, the private good of some other individual. The good of the whole is the good of each of its

parts. If an action or a policy is clearly not for the good of a particular group in society, then it is not for the common good. As we have seen in Aristotle's treatment of the subject, there are situations where there is no such thing as a political common good, qwing to the primacy given, on a large scale, to one's private advantage. Where such situations exist, they must be recognized for what they are.

#### CONCLUSION

There are two principal contributions which the works of Aristotle, Aquinas, Maritain, and De Koninck bring to the discussion of persons' relationship to society as a whole. The first is the discussion of the common good. In recent years, emphasis has quite understandably been placed upon the need to recognize individuafand collective rights, and to guarantee the protection of these rights either in a constitution or in legal sanctions. The need for this recognition of rights comes to our attention all the more in light of the fact that, in so many parts of the world, human rights are so readily trampled upon. And yet, the recognition of rights is still not enough. Society exists neither for itself nor for the private good of its members, but for the good of the whole society and of each of its members. The roie of political leaders, in particular, is to serve this common good and to recognize its primacy over their own private good. Political communities exist so that people can live well. Now, we cannot live a virtuous life in isolation, and therefore the good which society pursues is the common good of all.

The second contribution is that of a renewed emphasis on distributive justice. I have shown that it is the bonds of civic friendship which hold a political community together. Such friendship, however, is impossible without justice. This is true both of commutative justice (which deals with transactions among individuals) and of distributive justice (which deals with the material goods and responsibilities which

the community distributes to individual citizens). Our understanding of distributive justice, in contemporary society, must be extended to include guarantees for the provision of the basic necessities of life, and for the alleviation of afflictions such as poverty and chronic unemployment.

At this juncture, I would like to mention some questions which I have not discussed in this dissertation, and which could be subjects for others to pursue.

First, as was mentioned in the introduction to this dissertation, the dignity of human persons and the common good are the two foundational pillars of Catholic social teaching. In connection with this, it would be worthwhile to examine the influence of Jacques Maritain and Charles De Koninck on the Second Vatican Council ( 1962-1965), particularly on the documents Gaudium et spes (on the Church in the modern world) and Dignitat1s humanae personae (on religious freedom). Maritain was a personal friend of Pope Paul VI, and his ideas had an influence not only on Paul VI (who was pope from 1963 to 1978) but also on Pius XII before him (1939- 1958). And Charles De Koninck was, to my knowledge, the only layperson who was a peritus (appointed expert) at the Council. The question of these authors' influence on the Council could be a topic for an interesting doctoral dissertation in theology. Why theology? The reason is that the documents of Vatican II are primarily pastoral in orientation, and consequently their philosophical underpinnings are more often implied than stated.

Another possible area of enquiry would be to compare the vision of person and society in Maritain's or De Koninck's writings with the vision proposed by one or more liberation theologians (e.g., Gustavo Gutierrez,l Juan Luis Segundo, Segundo Galilea, Enrique Dussel, jon Sobrino, or Leonardo Boff). Such a dissertation would be interesting particularly on the

Isee, in this respect, Gutierrez's critique of Maritain in A Theology of Liberation: History, Politics, and Salvation (trs. Sister Caridad Inda and John Eagleson) Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books, 1973, pp. 54-56.

philosophical level. For example, it could compare two different philosophical anthropologies, or it could compare, say, the *structure* of society as proposed by Maritain, with the structure proposed by a liberation theologian.

Finally, another dissertation, in either philosophy or theology, could discuss the development of the themes of person and society in the social teachings of Pope john Paul II. Their content is quite extensive even on the philosophical level, and it could easily be the subject-matter of an entire dissertation.
