# Human Dignity and Bioethics

Alice Neel (1900-1984), *T.B. Harlem,* 1940, American. Oil on Canvas. 76.2 x 76.2 cm.

While most of the art world turned to abstraction towards the middle of the twentieth century, Philadelphia-born Alice Neel (1900-1984) courageously chose to remain a figure painter. Occasionally she painted the rich and famous–artists, playwrights, scientists, even a papal nuncio–but mostly her subjects were the unnoticed, the overlooked, the difficult. They were her neighbors in Spanish Harlem: stay-at-home mothers, pregnant mothers, door-to-door salesmen, restaurant workers, tradesmen. Nor did she shy away from those most would rather not confront–a dying, querulous old woman, a middle-aged man in the late stages of cancer, a young man ravaged by tuberculosis. But whether her subjects are young, old, famous, unknown, nude or clothed, Neel's gift was to reveal their common denominator: an ineffable, undefinable, invisible human quality we call dignity.

*T.B. Harlem,* completed in 1940, is one of the most well-known of Neel's paintings. Gaunt and resigned, the subject could have been a young man dying on a battlefield of World War II pinned with a medal of honor. Instead he is a young man in a Harlem hospital fighting an all too prevalent disease to the death. His badge of honor covers the wound of thoracoplasty, or surgically induced lung collapse, then a radical treatment of last resort for tuberculosis. Neel also accurately portrays the side-effects of both the treatment and the disease: owing to the loss of several ribs on the affected side, compensatory thoracic and cervical curvatures of the spine pull it into the opposite directions of an S-curve. Atrophied muscles of the arms and hands and the lax abdominal muscles suggest that the battle has been a long one; the atrophy is the result of disuse, the protuberant abdomen indicative of a long-standing lack of proper nutrition. But Neel's painting is not a medical treatise on tuberculosis. It is rather an eloquent essay on the inherent dignity of human beings that exists quite independently of exterior circumstances.

# <span id="page-10-0"></span>**Letter of Transmittal to The President of The United States**

The President's Council on Bioethics 1425 New York Avenue, NW, Suite C100 Washington, D.C. 20005 March 1, 2008

The President The White House Washington, D.C.

Dear Mr. President,

With this letter I am pleased to send you *Human Dignity and Bioethics: Essays Commissioned by the President's Council on Bioethics.* Like the Council's earlier volume, *Being Human: Readings from the President's Council on Bioethics*, this book is an anthology, in this case a collection of essays exploring a fundamental concept crucial to today's discourse in law and ethics in general and in bioethics in particular.

Since the Council's establishment in 2001, the concept of human dignity has figured frequently in many of the Council's reports. As a result, there have been repeated requests for clarification of the meaning of the term. The Council has decided to respond by putting the question to a diverse group of scholars, including members of the Council, the better to provide a sense of the breadth of opinions on what has become a controversial subject.

These essays make it clear that there is no universal agreement on the meaning of the term, human dignity. Some argue that human dignity has lost its traditional meaning. Others, by contrast, hold firmly to the view that dignity is an essential identifying and irreducible element of human nature. Still others take a more biological than philosophical or theological viewpoint on the question of the meaning of human dignity. An appreciation of the variety of these views is critical, if we are to understand the divergences in how we think and act in response to the challenges posed by contemporary bioethics.

Ultimately, the fundamental questions in law and ethics will be shaped by what we think it means to be human and what we understand to be the ethical obligations owed to the human person. We believe that the two volumes—*Being Human* and *Human Dignity and Bioethics*—provide the public and policymakers with the materials for a deeper understanding of the foundations upon which we build our answers to life's most challenging questions.

Sincerely,

Edmund D. Pellegrino, M.D. Chairman
