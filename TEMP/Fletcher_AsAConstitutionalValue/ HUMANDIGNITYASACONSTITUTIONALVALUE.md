## **HUMAN DIGNITY AS A CONSTITUTIONAL VALUE***

## **G.P. Fletcher**

(of the Faculty of Law, Columbia University)

The last few decades have witnessed a revival of Kantian legal thinking. In the works of our leading theorists about law and justice we regularly come upon references to Kantian ideas. We encounter the glorification of autonomy, the imperative of retribution in the criminal law, the injunction against using people as a means rather than treating them as an end1. Note the assumed importance of the topic in this paper. No one would question whether the protection of human dignity was a primary task of the contemporary legal culture2 . The resurgence of these values in European and North American legal thinking testifies to the increasing influence of Kantian thought and to the decline of the opposed constellation of ideas that we might generally call instrumentalist, consequentialist or utilitarian. This contrary tradition finds its roots in the work of Bentham3 and Austin4, more recently in the writings of Stephen5 and Holmes6 . The most vigorous exponents of this contrary school on the contemporary scene are those who urge a version of economic efficiency as the highest value of the legal system7.

In North America, the Kantian revival begins most promisingly with John Rawls' *A Theory of Justice* in **1971.** Drawing explicitly on Kant, Rawls argues for the primacy of liberty over economic values and the right of each person to the maximum degree of liberty compatible with a like liberty for all. In the field of criminal punishment, the 1970's also reflect a return to retribution as the motivating rationale for making criminals suffer for their misdeeds8 . In the field of tort law, we begin also to hear a variety of arguments in favour of the victim's autonomy as the central value of the system9 .These trends bear witness to the complexity of our moral experience. Paradoxically, in the period that sociologists have dubbed the "me" decade, with its physical fitness and therapeutic fads, we find legal and moral theorists returning to Kant in a quest for fundamental values.

In order to understand this quest, we need to remind ourselves of the basic tenets of the utilitarian opponent'0 .These are the values that everyone in the quest seems to reject. As you will recall, utilitarianism holds that the moral rightness of an act is determined **by** its consequences. The consequences that matter are those that bear on the welfare of human beings **-** in Bentham's version, on their welfare as reflected in the absence of pain and the intensity of their pleasure. An act is right if in the predictable future it will generate a net gain in the pleasure or welfare of the affected parties. In modern parlance, an act is right if its benefits exceed its costs. Both benefits and costs are measured **by** the impact of the act on

human welfare. In the byways of utilitarian thinking, there are many variations of these propositions. I wish to concentrate here, however, on a few central points in the teachings of Bentham and his followers.

The first point is that utilitarianism presupposes the ability to predict the future. Unless we can reliably predict the impact of our acts on persons who follow us in history, there is no sensible procedure for totting up the predicted benefits and costs of any particular act. Consider the classic problem whether it is right for a physician to conceal the truth about a fatal illness from her patient. The immediate benefit is the patient's happiness. He will die in peace, without suffering anxiety about the disease bringing him, moment by moment, closer to impending death. The long range cost of a known act of lying is the general diminution of all patients' faith in their doctors' truthfulness. If it is known that doctors sometimes lie about their patients' state of health, no patient can ever rely fully on the physician's word. In order to compute the benefits and costs of a single act of lying to a patient, one has to engage in calculations that neither computer nor human could master. Not only does one have to predict the future traces of a single act, but one has to know how intensely the resulting pleasure and pain will manifest itself in particular persons in the future. To make matters even more complicated, one might have to assess the qualitative nature of the present patient's blissful ignorance as contrasted to the future patients' anxiety about their doctor's truthfulness. As the final variable in the equation, one should even have to consider the gratification and pleasure the physician feels in exercising power by selectively disclosing the truth. The second feature of utilitarian thought raises issues of a different order. The test for an act's rightness is in impact on the welfare of all persons, including the actor. The test is neither egoistic nor altruistic. In deciding whether to lie to a terminal patient, the physician's welfare enters into the calculation as does the patient's. Yet neither person counts for more than one. The test is not egoistic, for the doctor must do more than maximize her own welfare. The test is not altruistic for the physician is entitled to count her own welfare along with the pain and pleasure of those affected by her lying. Utilitarians treat the realm of human welfare as though it were an undifferentiated substance of the human species that percolates through the species' individual representatives. When I experience pleasure, it is not *my* pleasure that I feel, but rather the pleasure of the human species that happens to manifest itself in me. I have no claim, no right, to my pleasure as though it were my private possession. It belongs to you as much as does to me. More properly, it belongs to the species as a whole. This is the conception of human welfare that prompts Rawls to complain that utilitarians do not "take seriously the distinction between persons."' 1

This leads us to the third critical feature of utilitarian thinking **-** the denial of the distinction between illegitimate and legitimate pleasures. There is no such thing as a right to any particular form of pleasure. Within the utilitarian calculus, there is no way to distinguish the legitimacy or rightfulness of the patient's not knowing the truth, the gratification of the physician in exercising power, and the anxiety of future patients. These are all forms of pleasure and pain and they are all of equal moral stature. You cannot solve the conflict by positing that patients have the right to know the truth and that physicians have no right to indulge in the pleasures of playing God about the welfare of others. This way of thinking is foreign to the utilitarian cast of mind. Thus we are reminded of the point of Bentham's famous aside: rights are nonsense and natural rights are nonsense on stilts"2.

These then are the three central features of utilitarian thought **-** letting the morality of acts turn on predictable consequences, treating pleasure as an attribute of the species rather than of individuals and denying the issue of legitimacy in assessing forms of pleasure. These three tenets constitute a way of thinking that has influenced English and North American

**11. J.** Rawls, *supra* note **13,** at 27

legal developments since at least the late nineteenth century. We see the impact of this way of thinking in the policy arguments favouring these four goals: (1) deterrence and rehabilitation in the criminal law, (2) controlling the police in applying the exclusionary rule, (3) riskdistribution in the law of torts and (4) facilitating productive transactions in the law of contracts. The most influential modem version of the theory is found in the school of law and economics, particularly in the simplified standards of efficiency and wealth-maximization in Posner's work13. There are minor technical ways in which the advocates of efficiency in the law depart from Bentham and his calculus of pleasure and pain'4, but these differences - I dare say - are no more than in-house debates among those who subscribe to the three central propositions of utilitarian thought.

The return to Kantian legal and moral thought represents a reaction to these tenets of utilitarianism. The movement is evident in the recurrent emphasis on the theory and content of human rights'5. The doctrine of rights represents a clear break with the three tenets circumscribing utilitarian thought. First, the doctrine of rights dispenses with the necessity of predicting the future. In order to resolve a conflict, such as that between the physician and her terminal patient, one may simply affirm or deny the patient's right to know the truth. Of course, there has to be some basis for finding or rejecting this right, and of these bases I shall have more to say later. At this juncture, the important feature of rights is that their existence does not depend on the good consequences that follow from their exercise. On the contrary, we are inclined to say that the consequences are good because they realize the existence of a right. If the patient has a right to know the truth about his physical condition, then the physician's telling him the truth constitutes a good consequence. Secondly, the theory of rights emphasizes our individual as opposed to our species nature. We have noted that utilitarian theory treats individuals merely as repositories of human happiness; no individual can claim his happiness as his private possession. If the species would enjoy a greater total happiness by one of us becoming miserable, then surely that is the correct utilitarian outcome. The matter is different with rights. By definition, rights stake out a sphere of individual dominance. If the patient has a right to know the truth, then he acquires control over that sphere of human interaction. He may exercise his right at the time and in the manner that suits him. In a world without distinct individuals, it is hard to imagine a doctrine of rights. And in a world of rights, it is hard to imagine a species without distinct individuals.

On the third point, the legitimacy of particular pleasures, the doctrine of rights obviously approaches matters differently. Take the physician's gratification in exercising power over her patients. The first thing we should want to know is whether the physician has a right to this power and to the resulting exhilaration. If the power is illegitimate, if she has no right to it, then surely the pleasure she feels in exercising it cannot be an argument in favour of her having it. On all three points, therefore, we see that the doctrine of rights departs radically from the methods and assumptions of utilitarian thinking.

Now there is no necessary reason that an advocate of human rights would turn to Immanuel Kant for support. Some rights advocates, such as Robert Nozick 6, turn to the tradition of natural rights as exemplified in John Locke' 7 . Yet the assertion of natural rights in the style of Nozick and Locke hardly constitutes a convincing moral theory for girding up particular claims of right. In reading Nozick, we find that the debate begins and ends with the assertion that particular rights exist'8.Nor does it help much to stress, as does Ronald Dworkin, that we

should take rights seriously 9.We need a convincing theoretical infrastructure, a convincing moral theory, to support both the existence of rights in general and the working out of particular rights that enable individuals to dominate over particular conflicts. Claims of revelation are not enough.

This is the reason that the contemporary opponents of utilitarian thinking turn to Kant". In the place of revelation, the philosophical tradition offers itself as a source of wisdom. In the literature of moral thought there is no more complete, more elegant and more engaging system than that worked out in Kant's advocacy and reflective critique of the moral law within us. It is from this complex system of thought that we derive the recurrent phrases of anti-utilitarian jurisprudence. We have an obligation to respect persons as ends in themselves. Autonomy is a self-evident good. Regard for human dignity is the touchstone of a civilized legal order. These maxims are all inspired by Kantian thinking.

## **II**

On the map of Kantian thought, there are many more landmarks and side-lanes than I could cover in this brief tour. I must limit my attention to a few thoroughfares that cut through his complex system of ideas. In this context, we should explore the distinctions between Kant's moral and legal thought. What is the basis for a Kantian theory of rights? Are there alternative bases in Kant for opposing utilitarianism? Does Kant support an individualistic or communitarian conception of society? These questions beckon us to enter the complexity of Kantian thought.

Kant's moral and legal theories develop at different stages of his monumental life's work. The moral theory first emerges in the Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals, published in 1785. The legal theory finds expression twelve years later inthe first half of the Metaphysics of Morals, which is indeed Kant's last great philosophical manuscript. Kant's purpose in the moral theory is not so much to teach us what is right, but to give an account of the moral law within us that informs us what is right. He assumed that murder, lying, false promising, suicide, failing to rescue others in distress and failing to develop our individual talents are all wrong. His problem was to explain this common understanding of morality.

In brief compass, his argument goes like this. Conduct is moral only if it expresses what is distinctively human about us. Our distinctive feature as humans is our reason. Therefore conduct is moral only if it is the product exclusively of reason, and not in the slightest the outgrowth of our animal, empirical selves. Now the question is: what does reason, as the exclusive guide to moral conduct, require us to do? Kant concludes that at minimum reason requires us to act out of respect for the law-like nature of our conduct. It is only when we focus exclusively on the law-like nature of our conduct that we can be sure that no factor of our animal selves intrudes upon our motivation. To enter into the world of reason and its laws, we must abstract ourselves from inclinations and desires connected to worldly circumstances. This process of abstraction leads to reverence for the law-like nature of our acts. But our acts have this law-like nature only if we are able to universalize the maxims of our conduct into universal laws. Thus the commitment to actingout of reason leads Kant to his first formulation of the categorical imperative: act only so that you may will the maxim of your conduct to be a universal law2 .

Two corollaries follow from this formulation of the moral law. First, for Kant, following the dictates of reason is equivalent to acting out of duty alone. The touchstone to his system of thought is the notion of duty. If we act exclusively out of respect for the law-like nature

**<sup>19.</sup>** See R. Dworkin, *supra* note 15

<sup>20.</sup> See e.g.J. Rawls, *supra* note 10; M. Sandel, *Liberalism and the Limits of Justice* (1982)

<sup>21.</sup> I. Kant, *Foundations of the Metaphysics ofMorals* (L. Beck trans. Bobbs-Merrill ed. 1969) at 21, 44

of conduct, then we are acting out of duty. Secondly, Kant links up the notion of duty with respecting human dignity, both in ourselves and in others. How this linkage occurs is admittedly obscure. The critical move in Kant's exposition is his claim that humanity and human dignity are the supreme values and they must be respected as ends in themselves. This claim leads him to his famous moral precept, equivalent in his mind to the categorical imperative: act only so as treat the humanity, in ourselves as well as in others, as an end itself and never merely as a means2 .

Kant completes his exposition of his moral theory by imagining a Kingdom of Ends, a moral heaven on earth in which all individuals will act exclusively out of duty and treat humanity, in themselves as well as in others, as an end in itself. In this Kingdom of Ends, human dignity will be the supreme value. It will have no price 2. It will never be sacrificed for the sake of other values. Kant bears no illusions about whether the Kingdom of Ends is possible on earth. Fully cognizant of the corruptible nature of human beings, of their constant subjugation to impulse and sensual inclination, he regarded the Kingdom of Ends as an ideal. It resembles the world that Jesus envisions in the Sermon on the Mount: we shall turn the other cheek and surrender all our garments to those who sue us for our coats 4 .

If Kant's moral theory resembles, in spirit, the aspirations of the New Testament, his legal theory captures the sensibility toward the law espoused in the five books of Moses. Morality remains an ideal, but law and legal theory must address itself to the human condition as we know it. In his mature years, at the age of 73, Kant brought to bear his life of philosophical reflection on the task of the designing the ideal legal order, an order that would be just but nonetheless sensitive to human beings in their spiritual and animal complexity.

The first task of a just legal order, Kant argues, should be to accommodate diverse expressions of choice and preference. These choices might be motivated by selfish as well as charitable instincts. The notion of Right provides the framework of ordering these conflicting, private acts. The Right is defined as the set of rules and conditions that enable each individual to act on his choices in a way compatible with the choices of others, as these choices are universalized across the legal system as a whole 2. Individual rights derive from this conception of a just legal order. We enjoy rights as enforceable claims against others. We exercise these rights by compelling others to respect the choices they have made, say by entering into contracts, or the choices of others, say by compelling them to desist from interfering with the freedom of others to choose. The state enjoys a right to punish as a way of compelling the citizenry to respect the structure of Right, the structure that guarantees to every individual the freedom to act on his private choices. As you will have noticed, Kant's legal theory is liberal in the classical sense. Indeed Kant's notion of Right closely tracks Rawls' first principle of justice. It guarantees the maximum amount of private choice for each individual compatible with a like degree of choice in others. Rawls merely reformulates this basic notion of liberal society by substituting the concept of liberty for the notion of private choice26.

Two important characteristics distinguish Kant's legal theory from his moral theory. First, the legal system stresses external compliance; the moral system, internal compliance. As far as the legal order is concerned, the only relevant question is whether you perform your obligations and desist from interfering with your neighbor's capacity for exercising his own choice. The moral system demands in addition that you act for the right reason, and the right reason means no more and no less than acting for the sake of duty. The legal system demands a minimum; the moral law exacts the maximum.

<sup>26.</sup> J. Rawls, *supra* note 13, at 60 ("Each person is to have an equal right to the most extensive basic liberty compatible with a similar liberty for others").

Secondly, the legal theory builds on the notions of objective right and of enforceable, personal rights. The moral system takes the opposite focus and concentrates exclusively on the derivation and fulfillment of duties. This distinction has deeper ramifications than we are currently inclined to think. Under the spell of the Hohfeldian maxim that rights and duties are strictly correlative, we are likely to miss the point of beginning a system of thought with one side of the equation or the other.

Kant's ideal legal order takes on a liberal cast precisely because it stresses the centrality of enforceable rights and the resulting spheres of individual dominance. In Kant's legal thought, there are no moral rights beckoning, as it were, for admission into the temple of the law. If a right exists, it is enforceable. Kant does discuss a possible equitable, but unenforceable right to the reformation of a contract price after rapid devaluation of the currency17, but he clearly treats this putative right as an exception to the conceptual connection between rights and the capacity to compel compliance.

The moral theory expresses a different conception of human relationships. In acting out of duty, in fulfilling the moral law, we overcome rather than exult in our individuality. If we all follow the dictates of reason, if we enter into the Kingdom of Ends, we create a convergent pattern of behavior. We all act alike in treating the dignity of ourselves and of others as the value beyond all measure. The Kingdom of Ends is a world without need for secular law; the realization of the moral law eliminates the private purposes that generate worldly conflict.

There is some problem in understanding what it means to be an individual in the Kingdom of Ends, for our existence in this ideal state partakes of the single noumenal self that unites the species8. Yet moral prescripts have little meaning unless they apply to individuals in their relations with each other. In the Kingdom of Ends, I should think, we are both one and many. The Kantian ideal is clearly communitarian, for our focus is not on our own selves, but on the vindication of the dignity of all human kind.

The communitarian ideal obviously stands squarely opposed to the doctrines of rights and of individual dominance that we find expressed in the ideal legal order. The difference between the communitarian moral ideal and the liberal legal ideal is readily illustrated in Kant's analysis of the duty to render aid to others in distress. As a moral matter, we are all obligated to render aid, for as human beings we could not will it to be the universal rule that no one would ever render aid to anyone in distress 9.We could not will this practice as a law of nature, for then we would be depriving ourselves of the aid and comfort of others when we are in need. The logic is less than compelling, for Kant reads into the human capacity to will, certain judgments about human beings as he perceived himself and others. That point aside, his conclusion that we are morally obligated to render aid expresses a communitarian ideal of reciprocal caring and support.

The same duty would not follow from the concept of Right, for my refusing to aid a specific person in distress would not interfere with the person's capacity to express and act on his own choices. In Rawls' idiom, the refusal to aid would not constrict the liberty of another; the liberty to be hard-hearted would be compatible with a like liberty for all. A liberal legal order, it follows, would not impose a reciprocal duty to care for our neighbors. It would be sufficient that we not interfere with our neighbors and that we permit them to realize their own private visions of the good life.

The conceptual underpinnings of this position bear mentioning. Neither Kant nor Rawls could erect their first principles of a just society without a clear distinction between interference and passive neglect. Interference violates the negative freedom of others, their freedom from intrusion. Passive neglect merely fails to honor their freedom to act with

**<sup>27.</sup> I.** Kant, *supra* note **28,** at 40

**<sup>28.</sup> For a** thorough **discussion of this problem, see R.** Wolff, *The Autonomy of Reason* **(1973), pp. 9-15**

**<sup>29.</sup> I. Kant,** *supra* **note 23, at 47**

social support. The proverbial victim, drowning as the passer-by continues on his way, obviously does not realize his freedom to act. For some, the reliance on this distinction as a premise of the Right means that the law incorporates hard-heartedness as a basic value. For Kant, the distinction means simply that the legal sphere demands a minimum as the foundation for social co-operation. Not all moral duties, and certainly not all exacted by the categorical imperative, need be enforced by law.

By eliciting these distinctions between Kant's moral and legal theory, we learn that the moral universe is more complex than we might think when we stress the opposition of utilitarianism and Kantian thought. The possibilities form a triangle of conflicting and intersecting paths. At one point of the triangle, we find the three tenets of utilitarian thought that are outlined above. At the second point, we find Kant's communitarian moral ideal; and at the third point, Kant's liberal idea of a just legal order.

If we attempt to force this triangular matrix into the dichotomy of individual and communitarian social ideals, we get a surprising result. Kant's moral theory bears closer resemblance to Bentham's utilitarian theory than we might previously have thought. Both of these moral theories start on the assumption that some feature of human nature constitutes a value that should not be sacrificed for any other value. For Kant that value is humanity or human dignity.

For Bentham that value is pleasure and the absence of pain. One might regard Kant's focus as sublime, and Bentham's as mundane; but that is not important as the methodological commonality of developing a moral system on the basis of the species nature rather than some possessed exclusively **by** individuals. Admittedly, their views about the relevant species are different. For Kant, the relevant category is human kind; for Bentham, it is all sentient beings. Nonetheless, the assumption of some quality that unites all individuals leads both Bentham and Kant to communitarian rather than individualist social ideals. For both, solidarity is more important than the fulfillment of the private self.

In view of the communitarian nature of both Kant's and Bentham's ethics, it is startling that today in the obsessively individualistic post-modem world, we should be arguing about whether we align ourselves with one or another of these eighteenth century thinkers. It is equally startling that those who oppose utilitarianism and seek support in the Kantian system fail to appreciate the radical differences between Kant's moral and legal thought. Rawls is a dramatic example. Rawls draws on Kant's definition of Right in formulating his principle of justice. Yet he relies on the moral theory to justify this principle. The original position, a timeless situation of contracting behind a veil of ignorance about particular human characteristicsO, bears resemblance to the noumenal self of pure reason, also a timeless realm abstracted from particular human characteristics. While Kant draws on the noumenal self in order to explain the possibility of moral action, Rawls invokes the original position for the opposite purpose: to justify his individualistic conception of a just social order". The amalgam of the moral and the legal in Rawls' thought explains the confusion about whether there is more than one person in the original position and what this one or more person(s) is doing. So far as Rawls follows Kant's legal thought, he thinks of numerous people in the original position negotiating with each other about the terms of a contract establishing a just social order. So far as he follows Kant's moral theory, he has only one person in his version of the noumenal world and that one person, abstracted from his particular circumstances, decides what would be just for all possible states of worldly existence 2. This confusion runs deeper than expositional inconsistency. It reflects Rawls' ambivalence about whether our guide should be the contractian model of the legal theory or

the abstracted self of the moral theory. Only concrete selves enter into contracts. Abstract selves have no one to contract with.

It is difficult to conclude here whether Rawls' system merely ignores the problem of reconciling Kant's legal and moral thought or whether it represents a profound solution to that unstated problem. I am concerned here, however, to state the problem and to ponder its possible solution.

Can we merge in one system of thought the liberal ideal of Kant's legal theory and the communitarian ideal of his moral theory? The legal systems of the capitalist world are all founded on liberal premises, yet they are all under pressure to incorporate communitarian values. To take the example of the duty to rescue, we witness constant pressure to expand the situations in which individuals are tortiously and criminally liable for failing to render aid in an emergency 33. Analogous problems arise in drawing the limits of defensive force against aggressorsM, working out the conflict between negligence and strict liability in tort law3 1 and determining the extent of reciprocal obligations between negotiating and other proximate parties not yet bound by formal contractual arrangements 36 . The problem is how we reconcile these conflicting legal assumptions. Are we doomed, as Duncan Kennedy argues, to suffer endless antinomies of individualistic and communitarian values? 37 Or is there some principled way of starting with liberal premises and selectively incorporating other values that have roots in our common humanity?

## **III**

In the balance of this article I shall concentrate on one attempt to infuse Kantian and communitarian moral values into a liberal legal order. Appropriately, I shall turn to the country of Kant's origin. The West German Basic Law, or constitution, of 1949 provides in article IP:

> Human dignity is invaluable. Respecting and protecting [this value] is the duty of all authority in the state.

Commentators make it clear that this reference to human dignity draws directly on Kantian sources39. The primary implication is that the state may not violate Kant's supreme moral principle, which, in one form, prohibits using individuals merely as a means to an end. An obvious violation would be punishing criminals solely as a deterrent to future law breakers. Treating the criminal as an object made to suffer so that others would not follow his example, would be to reduce the individual to a manipulable, external form. It would be the precise opposite of respecting his humanity as an end in itself.

This provision of the constitution has generated a vast case law, both before the federal constitutional court and in the regular criminal and civil courts. Studying these cases can inform us on the power and the pitfalls of seeking to integrate Kant's communitarian moral theory into a liberal legal order.

The National Socialist background to this provision should not be overlooked. After the terrors of that regime, German constitutionalists appropriately looked to their tradition in order to vindicate the centrality of the individual in the structure of constitutional values.

National Socialist jurists had in fact endorsed a racist version of utilitarian thought. For them, the Right was whatever was useful to the German Volk 4° .The Kantian reaction thrust the individual center-stage. The character should not exist for the sake of the play, but the drama of social life should evolve with respect for the integrity of every character.

Significantly, Article I of the constitution does its job without invoking the doctrine of rights. The state has a duty to respect and protect human dignity and according to the standard interpretation, private individuals have the duty to respect each other's dignity. But there is no reference to a right to this respect. Article I stands in contrast to Article II, which provides that every individual has a right to the free development of his personality4 1. That Article I relies implicitly on the notion of duty rather than of rights reflects its source in Kant's moral theory.

This structuring of the issue, as a matter of duty rather than of right, carries important practical implications. Before turning to these cases where the notion of duty matters, I should like to mention a few of the more routine applications of Article I. I shall refer to several cases in their historical order, without regard to the status of the decision in the hierarchy of German case law.

Large numbers of cases invoke Article I and the concept of human dignity as a basis for imposing constitutional restraints on criminal procedure. In 1954, for example, the Supreme Court in its chamber for criminal cases decided that using the results of lie detector tests would violate the dignity of the criminal suspect 2. The lie detector treats a potential witness as a psychological organism to be tested rather than as a person to be heard. Thus the case responds to the problem of converting the suspect into an object of the criminal proceedings rather than treating him as a subject in his own trial. Although the decision turns on the interpretation of several provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure, the animating force derives explicitly from Article I of the constitution.

In another important decision by the same court, rendered in 1960, the judges held that it would be impermissible to use surreptitiously made tape-recordings as evidence in a criminal case43 .

The decision relies upon both Articles I and II of the constitution. The principle of this case is elaborated more fully in a 1964 case", which also held that surreptitious taperecordings would not be admissible. The principle underlying the case is not so much privacy in the American sense, but the individual's right to the protection of the expressions of his personality. The individual expresses himself in private writings, such as diaries and letters, and in conversation. These products, these outflowings of the individual personality, are entitled to constitutional protection. Accordingly, it does not matter, as it does in American constitutional law, whether the evidence is seized by the police or by a private individual. The focus is not on the regulation and disciplining of the police, but on the protection of the individual, and, in particular, on the individual's right to personality. It follows from this foundation for the exclusionary rule that certain writings and other expressions would be exempt from the scope of the rule. If, for example, the suspect made a record or a diagram of a criminal act or if a spy made a report to a foreign agent, these communications would not be protected. As the court said in 1964: "It is the flourishing not the deterioration of the personality that the constitution protects. '4

In another series of cases, the courts have applied Article I to an examination of prison conditions in the Federal Republic. In 1967, the High State Court in Hamm decided that overcrowding in prison cells violated Article I of the constitution46 . The particular complaint was that the prisoners, several to a cell, did not have privacy in using the toilet. In another case in the same jurisdiction, decided in 197011, the court held that subjecting naked men to involuntary bodily contact in overcrowded showers violated the imperatives of the constitution. The notion of human dignity implicit in these cases seems to be slightly different from the Kantian principle. The conditions of confinement are regarded as demeaning or degrading. What is at stake is a certain level of privacy and comfort, and only in this sense could one say that human dignity is compromised. Although the remedy in these cases is not made explicit, they demonstrate the potential of applying Article I in a wide range of situations.

As noted in the cases excluding surreptitious tape recordings, Articles I and II of the constitution provide the foundation for the general right to personality. This is the German equivalent to the North-American concept of privacy. In many areas the two doctrines obviously overlap. Privacy, however, carries connotations of freedom from intrusion. The general right to personality has an active dimension. Protection of personality means that the individual is free to flourish in public as well as in private. Two examples illustrate the diversion. In one civil dispute, the plaintiff, a private investigator, sued a jealous husband, who hired the plaintiff to follow and observe his wife. The court held that the contract was unenforceable 4 l. Snooping on the wife violated her general right to personality and therefore constituted an immoral contract. With some difficulty, one could construe this contract as a violation of privacy. It seems more natural, however, to view the flaw as interference with the wife's free flourishing of personality. What is at stake, in our idiom, is a right to association rather than a freedom from intrusion.

To return to our theme of communitarian and particularly Kantian moral theory in a liberal legal order, I should like to focus on two areas in German law in which it matters that the analysis begins not with an assertion of private *right,* but with the *duty* to protect and respect human dignity.

The most dramatic diversions between protection based on a theory of duty and on a theory of personal rights arises in cases of injury to the personality after death. In a whole range of situations, we as well as the Germans recognize that there is an obligation to honor the dead. That, in my view, is why we prohibit the desecration of tombstones and unlicensed interference with the corpse. These intrusions are violations of the dignity of the deceased. Admittedly, if we press too hard on what it means for the dead to have dignity, we run into difficulty. Yet it is far more difficult, indeed inconceivable, to talk about the dead having rights. The case law in North America is clear on this point. The right to privacy ends with the life of the bearer49 .Whatever Woody Allen thinks about sex after death, it is clear that there is no right to privacy after death.

Yet a German Supreme Court decision in 1968 0 illustrates the potential for applying Article I of the constitution on behalf of the dead. The case arises from the famous novel Mephisto, written by Klaus Mann in 1936, while in exile in Amsterdam. In this novel, as in the motion picture by the same name, Klaus Mann attacks one of his competitors in the German theatre world of the early 1930's. Mann changes the name of the protagonist from Griindgens to H6fgens but in other respects, the leading character of Mephisto closely resembles the

actor and producer Griindgens. Mann embellishes the story with details of Grtindgens' sexual perversities and his collaboration with the Nazis. After the death of Grfindgens, his adopted son sued in a German court to prevent the circulation of the novel. If Griindgens had still been alive, it might be plausible to characterize the issue as one of privacy. But Grfindgens was dead. His adopted son did not sue in his own name or on the basis of a right derived from his adopted father. Rather he sued to protect the honor and the dignity of his deceased predecessor. The free speech issues raised by the case are troubling, but I shall leave them aside. For our purposes, the important conclusion of the German Supreme Court is that Article I applies on behalf of the dead. It is critical that Article I imposes a duty to respect human dignity. We have a duty to respect the dead, even though it is implausible to speak about their having a right to this respect.

In a more recent case, decided by a lower German court51, the jurisprudence of duties illustrates its power as a plausible foundation for the doctrine of entrapment in the criminal law. We have to confess that our own jurisprudence has not been adequate to explain why agressive solicitation by the police should prevent the conviction of those who, for example, buy or sell narcotics. The doctrine of the United States Supreme Court is that the entrapping undercover agent improperly induces the actor to commit the crime 2.

Thus, someone who knowingly and intentionally violates the law supposedly is not responsible. This is surely a fiction. The person who buys or sells narcotics as a result of police solicitation unquestionably acts voluntarily. Furthermore, we have difficulty, in Anglo-American law, explaining why solicitation by private parties should not lead to the same legal consequence of quashing the prosecution.

The duty to respect human dignity provides a basis for understanding the doctrine of entrapment. By inducing someone to commit a crime, the undercover agent treats the suspect as manipulable object. The manipulation does not undercut the criminal responsibility or the culpability of the entrapped person. The vice in the transaction lies on the side of the police officer, who relates to the citizenry as though they were pieces to be moved in the game of crime.

Thus in 1980, a lower German court in Heidenheim held that an undercover agent violated the dignity of a female suspect by exploiting a love relationship with her in order to entrap her in a narcotics transaction. Grounding entrapment in Article I's protection of human dignity explains why orchestrating crime is so offensive. The state and its officers should relate to the citizenry not as objects to be manipulated, but as responsible individuals. Seducing people into criminal acts reflects disrespect for their autonomy as persons. Yet it is hard to posit a right not to be seduced. It is our responsibility to resist the wiles of those who would entrap us into embarrassing, criminal situations. The virtue of the German analysis, therefore, is twofold. First it recognizes that the entrapped person actually does commit the crime and is responsible for doing so. Secondly, the offensiveness of the police behavior is seen not as a violation of the suspect's rights, but of the police officer's duty to respect the human dignity of suspects.

In the constitutional litigation of the United States, we encounter frequent references to human dignity. Some of the leading cases, such as the *Furman4* decision on capital punishment and the *Miranda55* decision on right to counsel, are studded with this golden phrase. Yet in the jurisprudence of the United States, we have yet to develop the Kantian foundations for the concept of human dignity56.Nor do we appreciate the significance of relying on duties rather

than rights as a basis for protecting human dignity. If we appreciate the extent to which this idea derives from Kant's moral theory, we will grasp its communitarian dimension. We will be moved, as the Germans have been, to ground the notion in the duty of the state to its citizens and in duties of citizens toward each other. We will escape the dominance of rights and develop a jurisprudence based on the principle of human solidarity. We will take the important step of integrating communitarian values into a liberal legal order.
