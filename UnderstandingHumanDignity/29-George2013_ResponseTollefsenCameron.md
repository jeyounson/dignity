# **Response to Tollefsen and Cameron**

#### *Robert P. George*

THE CHAPTERS BY CHRISTOPHER Tollefsen and Edwin Cameron offer deeply opposed positions on central issues pertaining to sexual morality and marriage. They are irreconcilable positions, so I will make no effort to reconcile them, or even to show that they are less distant from each other than first appears. Still, it is worth noting that both authors argue from an understanding of human dignity in which the obligation to respect dignity is an obligation to favour the well-being, the integral flourishing of the human person. The authors differ so fundamentally precisely because they have such profound differences about what constitutes and promotes the flourishing ofhuman persons when it comes to sexuality and the choices people face and make in which sexual desire and judgements about what is intrinsically good and bad and right and wrong crucially figure. And I want to suggest, in a moment, that these differences reflect competing conceptions of the nature of the human person-that being whose integral good should be respected and favoured in all of our choosing and acting, if, as both Professor Tollefsen and Justice Cameron believe, we have an obligation to honour human dignity.

For all their differences, we see in the chapters by both of these authors arguments reflective of what John Rawls called 'comprehensive views'. Of course; Rawls himself hoped that for purposes of political theory and thus for legislation and the design and functioning of political institutions (at least where questions of constitutional fundamentals and basic justice are concerned), we could lay aside comprehensive views and operate across their borders by way of an overlapping consensus on a purely political conception of liberalism. And Rawls himself struggled mightily, even heroically, to show how that might be possible. But his case was most vulnerable precisely on issues of the sort we are grappling with in this conference on human dignityissues that cannot be resolved without reflection and deliberation about the nature and worth of human persons.

We should not be surprised to find Professor Tollefsen and Justice Cameron arguing on the basis of comprehensive views. It is difficult to see how it could be otherwise once a social consensus on the nature, meaning, and purpose of an institution as fundamental as the institution of marriage has broken down-a breaking down that itself reflects the shattering of a fairly · wide consensus in the domain of sexual ethics. Similarly, it is difficult to see how a purely political liberalism, or any rigorously anti-perfectionist theory of political morality, could handle questions such as abortion and euthanasia in circumstances in which reasonable people of goodwill do not, or no longer, agree on such questions as who is a member of the human community whose dignity is to be respected, and whose rights are to be protected, by the effective application and enforcement of principles of political justice.

And so we are brought to a conflict of understandings of the human good and its integral directiveness as shaped by principles of morality for the guidance of our sexual conduct as individuals and for our decisions as communities regarding the regulation, or possible regulation, of sexual behaviour. And we are brought to a profound disagreement about *what marriage is* and what posture towards it law and the institutions of the polity ought to take.

The debate about marriage is sometimes depicted as a dispute about 'who should be permitted to marry' or 'who should be permitted to marry whom'. This is deeply misguided. Those who characterize the debate in this way are, perhaps unwittingly, simply helping themselves to the answer they happen to prefer to the question they are evading: *What is marriage?* They are, in most cases, assuming that marriage is fundamentally a form· of sexual-romantic domestic partnership-a particularly intense form of friendship, or, in the (approving) words of John Corvino, 'your relationship with your Number One person'. On the basis of this (ordinarily) undefended assumption, they then maintain that 'restricting' (as they characterize it) marriage to male-female relationships is a denial of 'marriage equality'. But the undefended assumption is precisely what is contested by defenders of the historic conception of marriage as a conjugal union. To leave it undefended, therefore, is to beg the question (however useful it may be as part of a political strategy to brand one's opponents as enemies of equality and promoters of prejudice).

Professor Tollefsen ably sets forth and defends the' rational-moral foundations of the conjugal conception of marriage. It is an understanding of marriage as the distinctive type of relationship that is ordered to, and would be naturally fulfilled by, the spouses conceiving and bringing up children together-a type of relationship (unlike ordinary friendships, however intense they may be, and other private partnerships) in which society as a whole has a profound interest because of its child-rearing value significance. Marriage is, according to the understanding Tollefsen defends, the union of husband and wife in a multi-level (biological, emotional, volitional, rational) sharing of life whose

foundation and matrix is the bodily (or 'one-flesh') union made possible by the sexual-reproductive complementarity of male and female. Though marriage is naturally ordered to procreation and the rearing of children, it is *intrinsically* and not merely instrumentally valuable. It is not a mere means-to children, to pleasure, to the expression of tender feelings, or anything else. Therefore, as the law has historically recognized, acts of sexual congress that consummate and renew marriages-acts that fulfil the behavioural conditions of procreation-have their meaning and significance, and thus their integrity as a form of bodily communion, quite independently of whether the nonbehavioural conditions of procreation happen to obtain. A marital act is an act that is per Je apt for procreation-an act that unites spouses *biologically* (as 'one flesh-'); but its quality as a marital act does not depend on whether procreation occurs, can occur, or is desired or intended. True biological unity is an aspect of *personal* unity because the body, far from being a mere extrinsic instrument of the person (where the person is identified exclusively with the conscious and desiring aspect of the self) is part of the personal reality of the human being-because the person is properly understood as a dynamic unity ofbody, mind, emotion, spirit.

On the conjugal understanding, marriage is, in a sense, a natural kind, and in an even deeper sense a rational kind, since it is a basic aspect of human well-being and fulfilment which, as such, provides a more than merely instrumental reason for choice and action. And so marriage is inherently, and not merely incidentally, a *sexual* partnership (a *bodily* union) and it is intrinsically shaped by norms of sexual exclusiveness and fidelity and a pledge of permanence of commitment. Unlike the 'sexual-romantic domestic partnership' conception of marriage, or any conception that treats marriage as essentially an emotional bond (and not one founded on true bodily union), the conjugal understanding can give an account of the rational basis of these norms as moral principles.

Of course, Justice Cameron's view differs radically from Professor Tollefsen's view. According to Cameron, sexual choices are above all matters of personal expression. Sexual desires and general orientations differ, and people have an interest in being able freely and without shame or stigma to act on these desires, so long as they respect the rights of others. In so acting, they express who they are, some aspect of their identities, their very selves. If, indeed, dignity is intrinsic to each person, as Justice Cameron and Professor Tollefsen agree it is, then, according to Cameron, 'it comprises the deeply personal understandings we have of ourselves and our worth as individuals and in our material and social context'. And so, in its public dimension, particularly as a value that infuses rights, especially the rig4t to equality, respect for

human dignity should enable people 'without fear of abuse, discrimination, or constraint, to engage out in the world in the commitments and activities that embody who we are and wish to become-to attain self-actualization, despite the accidents of our birth and notwithstanding any incidents of lifestyle'.

And so Justice Cameron's expressive individualist understanding of sexuality and Professor Tollefsen's natural law understanding represent competing visions of what makes for, and detracts from, human well-being and moral uprightness in a central area of human concern and striving. From Justice Cameron's point of view, dignity figures in a proper analysis of the problem as a principle prohibiting stigmatization of people for acting freely on sexual desires, and thus expressing who they are and what they wish to become. From Professor Tollefsen's point of view, dignity figures as the reality we honour in ourselves and others when we order desire to the demands of practical reason and moral uprightness in our personal choices and actions, and when we as communities privilege and protect the institution of marriage as a conjugal union.

As Justice Cameron's chapter makes clear, this is not, as it is sometimes depicted, a debate about whether to 'expand' marriage to accommodate samesex partnerships while retaining the social normativity of marriage and the specific norms that have traditionally been regarded as giving marriage its shape and substance-norms of monogamy, exclusivity (fidelity), and the pledge of permanence of commitment. This is evident throughout his chapter, but clearest in his expression of concern that 'there may be a danger that insti-' tutionalizing same-sex marriage may replace one set of dangerous repressive social norms for another-the legal sanction of sexual sameness or conformity'. His is no mere proposal to jettison the idea of sexual complementarity ' as an essential aspect of marriage while retaining traditional norms of sexual ethics, such as those condemning promiscuity, multi-partner (polyamorous) sexual unions, and the like.

Of course, his reference to 'dangerous' and 'repressive' social norms reflects the broader set of widerstandings and commitments that inform Justice Cameron's expressive individualism as a comprehensive view. From Professor Tollefsen's perspective (and my own), those norms-monogamy, sexual exclusivity and fidelity, permanence of commitment-are the opposite of dangerous and repressive; they are ennobling and enriching. They are generated not by some desire for 'sameness' or 'conformity' for its own sake but by an understanding of the various aspects ofhuman well-being and fulfilment integrally conceived. Indeed, far from being 'repressive', they liberate us by way of fidelity to reason from what I once heard Elizabeth Anscombe describe as the most humiliating form of indignity-slavery to desire.

Of course, where Professor Tollefsen sees slavery to self, Justice Cameron sees fulfilling self-expression and self-actualization. And so he views Professor Tollefsen, and the Catholic Church, as enemies of human flourishingenemies who are guilty of crimes against humanity that are deeply analogous to the crime of apartheid. So, presumably, the reparative project that he would carry out in the name of human dignity would stigmatize and, in palpable ways, limit certain opportunities and liberties of Catholics, many Protestants, Orthodox Jews, Muslims, and others who hold views contrary to his on questions of sexual morality and the nature and proper definition of marriage. And this, too, I think demonstrates that this dispute really is profound and not resolvable at the level of shared principle. One hopes that that the struggle will be political, and not carried out by non-political or non-democratic means; and that even in the political struggle-and even when each side must, in conscience, speak hard words to the other-we can do it with civility and respect.

Justice Cameron makes it clear that he feels insulted and demeaned when someone like Professor Tollefsen asserts that sexual conduct outside the marital bond is morally wrong, and that marriage is a conjugal union. From his expressive individualist point of view, defenders of traditional sexual morality are enemies of personal self-realization, and thus ofhuman dignity. I am sure that Professor Tollefsen feels no less insulted and demeaned-I certainly dowhen someone like Justice Cameron equates the conjugal view of marriage and sexual morality with bigotry-indeed, with something as ugly and evil as apartheid. From a natural law point of view, expressive individualist ideology undermines human dignity by encouraging people to yield to unworthy desires, thus damaging their own integrity and contributing to the erosion of a cultural environment in which marriage and the norms of sexual exclusivity and fidelity essential to it can flourish.

Who is right? No one can answer that question for himself or herself without-wading into the deep philosophical waters of debates about expressive individualism and the moral understandings that, since the 1960s, have been aggressively challenged in its name. Unfortunately, many people seem to want to dodge the hard questions, or excuse themselves from engaging in serious arguments about deep and difficult philosophical matters. They sometimes dismiss such arguments as 'convoluted' or claim that they are merely a cover for unworthy motives. At the same time, they help themselves to controversial premises needed to support the positions they prefer, then claim that it is all, really, very simple.

But it is not.

The foregoing commentary, which is essentially what I presented at the Oxford conference on human dignity at which Professor Tollefsen and Justice

Cameron gave their chapters, is an assessment of the papers as they were presented there. Professor Tollefsen's chapter remains substantially the same. But Justice Cameron, perhaps accustomed as a judge to having the final word, chose to revise his chapter to insert into it an attack on me personally. Regrettably, he deploys in that attack the same sorts of abusive terms and forms of rhetorical manipulation he used in his efforts to blacken Professor Tollefsen. It is an altogether unlovely and unedifying maneuver-quite unworthy of the ambitions of this volume to provide a model of civil and serious argumentation and debate among people of goodwill representing a range of viewpoints. But it does necessitate a response.

Justice Cameron opens his attack by informing readers that he is going to 'deal with' the arguments on the nature of marriage I have presented in various places; but then says he will do so only 'cursorily' because 'the impermissibility of same-sex marriage seems as difficult to propound on coherent and rational moral grounds as the impermissibility of interracial marriage.' This is a rhetorically sly way of excusing himself from the obligation to engage serious arguments against his view in a serious way. But even if we lay aside for a moment his efforts to link those with whom he disagrees to the vile phenomenon of racism, it is clear from his very terms of reference that he profoundly misunderstands the arguments he has promised to 'deal with.' The claim of his opponents is not about the *permissibility* of non-conjugal 'marriage' -it is about its *possibility.* It is not about who should be 'permitted' to marry or 'prohibited' from marrying; it is about *what marriage is.* My argument is that marriage is inherently a conjugal union, and that the alternative position (i.e., 'marriage' as a form of sexual-romantic companionship or domestic partnership) cannot account for the norms and other defining features of marriage that remain largely uncontested, even as we debate the validity of the norm of sexual complementarity.

In the debate over interracial marriages, at least in the United States, the question was precisely whether such marriages should be *permitted* or could rightly be *prohibited.* No one doubted that they *were* conjugaJ partnerships, and therefore entirely *possible.* Of course, racism alone could account for the view that such marriages should be forbidden and subjected to criminal prohibition. That is why we rightly condemn laws prohibiting marriage across racial lines as gravely unjust and an on human dignity. By contrast, as I have noted, the question at issue in the present debate is: *What is marriage?*  Is it a conjugal partnership, or is it a form of sexual-romantic companionship or domestic partnership? If it is the former, same-sex and polyamorous partnerships cannot be marriages and should not be recognized as such. If it is the latter, they can be, and should be. So which is it?

Marriage, understood as a conjugal union and not as a mere form of sexual-romantic companionship or domestic partnership, is ubiquitous in human history. One finds it in the laws and customs of diverse cultures and religions, as well as in the thought of figures ranging from Plato, Mistotle, Xenophanes, Musonius Rufus, and Plutarch, to Augustine, Aquinas, Kant, Anscombe, and Gandhi. No one of whom I am aware even attempts to argue that the conjugal understanding of marriage arose in our law and culture or any others as a result of racism or animus of any type, including hostility to persons who experience same-sex attraction. Plainly it didn't. The legal treatment of sodomitical acts as non-marital has historically applied to opposite sex couples, *including those who are lawfully married.* Marriage was understood as consummated by and only by reproductive behaviour, that is, acts that fulfil the behavioural conditions of procreation (quite irrespective of whether the nonbehavioral conditions happen to obtain). 1 Such acts were understood as uniting spouses as a biological unit (and not merely as juxtaposing flesh to produce sexual pleasure), and this unity was understood to be foundational to marriage considered as a comprehensive union, that is, a unity of hearts and minds, but one that differed from other sorts of personal relationships by its extension into the bodily plane-the body being, as John Finnis explains, no mere subpersonal instrument, but part of the personal reality of the human being.2 None of these ideas were manufactured as pretexts for excluding anyone from marriage.

Because the idea of marriage as a conjugal union was not developed to establish or reinforce a system of subordination and exploitation, we cannot dismiss it as inherently unjust in the way we rightly dismiss the prohibition of interracial marriages. So, in contending that the norm of sexual complementarity should be abolished, it is incumbent upon Cameron and those on his side to make a philosophical case for their view and to respond in a serious (and not merely 'cursory') way to the philosophical arguments adumbrated by those of us who defend the conjugal understanding of marriage. This includes meeting the challenges that remain utterly unaddressed by: Cameron and others who seek to redefine marriage, namely, the challenges to identify

1 Cameron seems to suggest that this view-which he characterizes in typically reductive fashion as 'sex involv[ing] a penis and vagina', then dismisses (without argument) a 'ludicrous'-is original with me or thinkers associated with me. Nothing could be farther from the truth. The identification of acts fulfilling the behavioural conditions of procreation as uniquely marital (and distinguishable from other acts of penetration or juxtaposition involving sexual organs) has been embodied in our law of marital consummation for centuries, and was established quite independently of debates about same-sex relations.

principled grounds consistent with their view of marriage as sexual-romantic companionship or domestic partnership for holding that marriage is a permanent and exclusive union of two and only two persons. After all, if two men or two women can marry, then what sets marriage apart from other bonds must be *emotional intensity or priority.* But nothing about emotional union or intensity requires it to be pledged to permanence, as opposed to deliberately temporary (or binding only 'for as long as love lasts'). Nothing beyond mere sentiment or subjective preference would require it to be sexually 'closed' as opposed to 'open', or limited to relationships oftwo persons, as opposed to three or more in 'polyamorous' sexual ensembles. Indeed, there would be no ground for understanding marriage as a *sexual* partnership--one that requires consummation by sexual intercourse-as opposed to one integrated around any of a range of possible non-sexual shared interests or commitments (for example, playing tennis, reading novels, or supporting a favourite team). Nor would there be any basis for understanding marriage as a relationship that is inherently enriched by family life and shaped by its demands. Yet these have always been defining features and norms of marriage-features and norms that make marriage unlike (and unlike *in kind,* and not merely in degree of emotional intensity) other forms or companionship or domestic partnership.

Cameron simply refuses to engage the central question: *What is marriage?.* But his delinquency goes beyond even this dereliction of scholarly duty. After thoroughly misstating-indeed, mangling-the basic arguments he promised to 'deal with', he makes matters worse by *not dealing with them*even 'cursorily.' Instead of counterarguments designed to expose errors of fact or fallacious inferences in the views he attributes to his opponents, he provides a string ofundefended assertions (as ifhe were pronouncing judgments from the bench or launching thunderbolts from Mount Olympus), relying on denunciation and adjectival insults ('absurd', 'ludicrous', 'silly', 'rigid', and on and on) as a substitute for argument. Does he suppose that his readers will be too dim to notice the absence of argumentation? Or does he imagirie that those against whom he shamelessly deploys these tactics will be too politeor intimidated-to respond? I'm afraid I am neither.
