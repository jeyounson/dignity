# **Discourses of Dignity**

#### *Gerald L. Neuman 1*

THESE REFLECTIONS ARE WRITTEN from the perspective of a legal academic, whose professional training relates to human rights as they are embodied in institutions of national and international law. In observing and participating in a cross-disciplinary conversation about human dignity, the concerns of my home discipline inevitably colour my perceptions. The contributions of other disciplines can improve our understanding of the principle of human dignity and its consequences in the world. The kind of understanding we seek, however, is not necessarily the same.

#### Cognate concepts

The participants in the conversation come from different disciplines and employ different discourses. The principle of human dignity operates as a different kind of proposition in the different discourses.

For historians, the principle of human dignity is an evolving theme in the history of ideas; they may trace its transformations and ramifications and revivals without taking any position on how the principle is best understood or whether it has any validity. For philosophers, the principle of human dignity potentially states a moral norm whose content, validity, and consequences should be explored. Some philosophers affirm and elaborate the principle; some philosophers analyse invocations of human dignity as covering a variety of asserted norms that may be inconsistent with one another; and some philosophers dismiss the very notion of human dignity as delusion or deceit. For theologians, ifl have understood our discussions correctly, the principle of human dignity may be a proposition about the relationship between human beings and God. Different theologians offer different

<sup>1</sup> I should state that this chapter is written in my personal capacity, and not in my capacity as a member of the UN Human Rights Committee, and that it does not speak on behalf of that treaty body.

accounts of the aspects of this relationship that ground an affirmation that human beings possess dignity in the relevant sense.

For lawyers, on the other hand, the principle of human dignity appears as a positive legal norm in a particular legal system. The system in question may involve a national constitution, or the European Convention on Human Rights, or European Union law, or a global human rights instrument. The principle of human dignity has a textual existence that lawyers must recognize, and a normative force that must be constructed if not deduced.

Even within the different discourses, we know that there is disagreement among the participants. But certain common features may provide reassurance that many of us are talking about cognate concepts, even if some other participants deny the existence of human dignity, or interpret dignity in a manner antithetical to the human dignity principle.

The principle of human dignity asserts that human beings have intrinsic value. The principle emphasizes that *all* human beings have that intrinsic value, and that they cannot lose or forfeit it. The principle further maintains that certain forms of treatment of a person are inconsistent with that value, and therefore wrong.

We may disagree about why human beings possess intrinsic value, or about which forms of treatment are inconsistent with that value, while still ascribing to versions of the same principle. Those who assert that human dignity must be earned by virtuous conduct, or is unequally distributed, are talking about something else.

In the political sphere, the principle of human dignity also tells us that the state exists for the sake of individual human beings. They do not exist for the sake of the state.

### From human dignity to human rights

The principle of human dignity serves as part of the foundation of human rights law, at least in the sense that recognition of this value gives us reason to construct a system of legal rights, calculated to protect individuals against treatment inconsistent with human dignity. We can call these legal rights *positive human rights,* as creations of positive law (positive being in contrast with unenacted moral human rights, rather than in contrast with negative human rights ).2 Human rights treaties, for example, normally set out a list of the posi-

2 Lawyers sometimes distinguish between negative rights that impose duties of inaction and positive rights that impose affirmative duties of action, but that contrast involves a different meaning of positive. tive human rights that the states that ratify the treaty agree to protect, and also articulate secondary legal rules regarding how the treaty itself will operate to facilitate that protection.

From the legal perspective, one can affirm that the human dignity principle provides the foundation of a system of human rights, without meaning to claim that each positive human right could be deduced rigorously from the principle of human dignity. Rather, the human dignity principle justifies concern about threats to the lives and interests of human beings, a concern that extends to all human beings. The international human rights system also rests on the conviction that empowering individuals, by configuring many of the rules that protect them as legal rights that they can assert, best serves their human dignity.

The articulation of positive human rights may be motivated by insights from other disciplines such as moral philosophy, political science, or religion. Nonetheless, the relationship between positive human rights and these nonlegal principles is varied and complex. Some positive human rights provisions attempt to express moral norms directly in implementable language; some positive human rights provisions merely approximate moral norms that cannot be concisely summarized; some positive human rights provisions create institutions that were chosen by the drafters as means for the protection of other human rights rather than as direct embodiments of non-legal principles.

An analogous example from US constitutional history may illustrate this last point. When James Madison introduced his proposals for a Bill of Rights in the US Congress in 1789, he described the right to jury trial as a needed positive protection for natural rights rather than as a natural right itself: 'Trial by jury cannot be considered as a natural right, but rather a right resulting from a social compact, which regulates the action of the community, but is as essential to secure the liberty of the people as any one of the pre-existent rights of nature. ' 3 Today, jury trial is not part of the international corpus of positive human rights, but a more generalized guarantee-the right to a 'fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal'-is included. 4 Many positive human rights are specific procedural rights, chosen for their predicted effects rather than for their own sake.

The element of choice in the design of positive human rights provisions also reflects the reality that human rights treaties are constructed by political processes. Crucial steps in the drafting and adoption of the treaties are

performed by political interaction of representatives of governments, including negotiation and vote-taking, either at the inter-governmental level or within the framework of international organizations; ratification of the resulting treaties by particular states involves political processes at the national level. The authoritative character of positive human rights provisions comes not merely from the moral appeal of the norms but also from the political endorsement that the drafting and ratification processes provide.

Political processes often involve compromise, and the drafting of positive human rights provisions may involve compromises of principles as well as compromises of interests. Sometimes different normative premises held by different political actors produce a common consequence, and no compromise is necessary. At other times, good faith normative disagreements can be resolved only by adopting second-best formulations that do not fully satisfy either party's commitments. Thus, there are many ways to construct a positive human rights system, and perhaps all of them are imperfect.

As I have emphasized in other writing, the considerations just given call attention to three aspects of positive human rights norms that influence the interpretation of human rights treaties. 5 One is the consensual aspect, derived from the completed or ongoing political processes that give the norms their positive force. Another is the suprapositive aspect, recalling the non-legal normative principles-which may be multiple or contested-that motivate their adoption. A third, often overlooked, is the institutional aspect, responding to the need to elaborate positive human rights as legal rules in a manner that facilitates compliance by duty-holders and oversight of their compliance by monitoring bodies. For present purposes, the important point is that although non-legal principles may legitimately influence the interpretation of positive human rights, the relevant non-legal principles may be multiple or contested, and there are other aspects that influence interpretation.

### Constitutions and human dignity

Other chapters in this book illustrate the diversity oflegal systems that protect human dignity at the national level. In some countries, such as the USA, human dignity remains in the background as a value justifying the set of human rights, but does not operate as an applicable legal rule at all.6 The Declaration

of Independence asserted a natural law theory of rights that was not expressly repeated in either the Preamble or the operative provisions of the Constitution. Human dignity surfaces in judicial reasoning to inform the interpretation of enumerated rights, particularly since the end of the Second World War, without producing any positive right or enforceable principle of human dignity.

In other countries, such as Germany, an express constitutional provision on human dignity is interpreted as a very specific norm, accompanying a thick set of other enumerated rights that already do most of the work of protecting human dignity. The structure of the *Grundgesetz* makes the human dignity provision in Article 1 unamendable, and its phrasing has been construed as making it absolute. These features make judges cautious about invoking the human dignity provision to deal with cases that other, less rigid provisions could resolve. 7

The European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, reflecting clear German influence, also devotes its first article to guaranteeing human dignity, described as 'inviolable', before proceeding to an extensive series of other rights. 8 While the Charter's acquisition oflegal force under the Lisbon Treaty is too recent to provide sufficient data on how the European Court of Justice will interpret the provision, the success of Germany in spreading its textual model across the entire European Union appears highly consequential.

In some constitutional systems more sparsely endowed with enumerated rights, an express provision on human dignity has become the operative norm from which interpreters derive (or to which they attribute) the more specific rights needed for its protection. The human dignity provision thus plays the residual role that the due process clause has played in the USA, and that the clause on the free development of the personality has played in Germany. Justice Barak's chapter in this book describes how a human dignity guarantee has operated in this manner in Israel. Hungarian constitutional law of the 1990s provides another example, in which the constitutional court characterized the

The English and French texts use the same word, which has the same spelling in both languages.

human dignity clause as a 'mother right' or 'parent right' from which other unenumerated rights emerge.9

The positive legal meaning of human dignity as a term of in legal discourse thus varies among these different kinds of systems, because the phrase serves different functions within their constitutional structures. The legal content of the term would vary from country to country,. even if there were no disagreement about the corresponding concept in other discourses. In our interconnected world, these meanings will often be developed in different local contexts with attention to both local and transnational influences.

One could ask what role the cross-disciplinary conversation pursued in this volume has in this transnational process. To some extent, the participants leave the conference and go back home to their own disciplines. Academics may do their best and thickest work within their fields, where they best understand the methods and traditions. What problems are worth investigating, what counts as evidence, how hypotheses are phrased, what terms mean and what baggage they carry, who are authorities to be reckoned with-these and other questions will vary across disciplines, and also across subfields within disciplines, and often across national borders. Researchers studying the same social phenomena may describe their data in very different manners in order to render them subject to the methods of their fields. Communicating across disciplinary boundaries may require simplification and may produce misunderstanding.

Nonetheless, the translation across boundaries may point to possibilities. For example, the chapter by Professor Goos examines the secret history of the drafting of Article 1 of the *Grundgesetz,* and the particular conception of human dignity that he found there. This conception may or may not have authority within German constitutional law. This conception has no authority. outside Germany, but it is available for consideration and appropriation, or for adaptation, if it seems to have genuine explanatory power elsewhere. A court contemplating the borrowing of this conception might ask such questions as whether the conception is consistent with the operative text or other expressions of political consent within its legal system, how the conception coheres with the system's suprapositive commitments, whether it facilitates the broad or narrow functional role that a positive human dignity norm serves within the system, and how the distinctions drawn by the conception lend themselves to application and enforcement within its institutions.

Hungary adopted a new constitution in 20 II, which need not be discussed here.

#### DISCOURSES OF DIGNITY 643

# Universal human rights

The international human rights regime has a different origins story, which has been retold repeatedly. In the establishment of that regime, human dignity had a consensus-building function for participants from different geographical and ideological backgrounds. All agreed on the urgency of affirming the universal possession of human rights in the wake of violent ultranationalism and colonialism10-and it is worth pausing for a moment to emphasize colonialism as an antithesis of universality. In the present era, voices continue to insist that international human rights must be defensible in terms that could be globally accepted, and not merely on the basis of a current political consensus in Europe.

In the international human rights system, human dignity is mostly foundational but sometimes operative as an applicable norm. Human dignity appears in the nearly identical preambles of the two Covenants, the principal human rights treaties designed to give legal force to the aspirational Universal Declaration of Human Rights. In the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), human dignity then returns in Article 1 0(1 ), which requires that 'all persons deprived of their liberty shall be treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person'. 11 The official interpretation of this provision by the relevant treaty body, the Human Rights Committee (HRC), requires that states provide humane conditions of confinement, taking into account international prison standards, and also that detainees should 'enjoy all the rights set forth in the Covenant, subject to the restrictions that are unavoidable in a closed environment' .12 So construed, the provision does not provide much occasion for a priori reasoning about the entailments of the concept ofhuman dignity.

Human dignity also plays a role in interpretation of other provisions of the ICCPR, 13 and sometimes supplies reasons to limit a claim of right, in the

name of the rights of others, as in the well-known decision upholding a prohibition on arranging the activity of dwarf-tossing as a sporting event. 14 Like other defenders of that decision, I do not agree with the criticism that the HRC misconstrued the concept of human dignity in order to impose on the complaining party, M. Wackenheim, a requirement that he behave in a 'dignified' fashion; rather, I believe that the committee correctly found that the state had reasonably chosen to suppress a practice that treated a vulnerable minority as objects to be abused, and that undermined societal respect for the human dignity of the group in genera1. 15

In the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), human dignity resurfaces in a variant form in Article 13 on the right to education, but the other provisions enumerating economic, social, and cultural rights define them without express reference to dignity. 16 It could be said that Article 13 is written at one remove from a substantive norm of human dignity, because it provides that 'education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality *and the sense of its dignity,* and shall strengthen the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms'. The General Comment of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regarding Article 13 also invokes this phrase as part of its justification for construing the treaty as prohibiting corporal punishment in schools. 17

More specific human rights treaties at the global level add a few more operative provisions referring to human dignity or its perception. The Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities include some norms that focus on enhancing their beneficiaries' sense of their own dignity, 18 as well as a few regarding respect for

struing the derogation clause of the ICCPR in relation to the rights of detainees, in light of the principle of human dignity).

<sup>15</sup> With regard to the committee's action, it may also be worth explaining that the committee merely held that France had not violated M. Wackenheim's rights under the ICCPR by prohibiting the event; the committee did not hold that the ICCPR required France to prohibit the event.

What role can theologically based interpretations of human dignity play in filling out the meaning of these global human rights?

The global human rights instruments, which are the fullest exercise in universality, aim at the protection of the human dignity of all persons under all governments in all societies.21 They speak to Christians and also to Muslims and Buddhists and Hindus, as well as to adherents of indigenous belief systems of many kinds, and to non-believers. They speak to societies with majorities of various kinds, and they are administered by international bodies whose members have diverse religious and non-religious commitments.

This diversity of addressees makes extremely visible the need for generalizable arguments of human dignity which do not ground their details in a single religious tradition. The international human rights system cannot favour one religion as such over another. I mean to assert not merely that the system should not but that it cannot. This proposition is not offered as a claim about political liberalism or as a theory of the secular state. Rather, this proposition reflects the basic fact that all religions in the world, including Christianity, are minority religions at the global level.

As Christians, we claim our international human rights in countries with non-Christian majorities on the same basis as non-Christians claim their international human rights in countries with Christian majorities.

communications and concluding observations on country reports, insists on the protection of those rights on the same basis. 22

Emphasizing the need for generalizable arguments does not imply that structures of reasoning first developed within a specific religious tradition should not be employed within the international human rights system, even if they remain persuasive after they have been adapted to an external context. The reasons may be capable of translation across the discursive boundary, into terms suitable for secular legal argument, without losing all their persuasive force. In the process, they will lose some of their richness, and it may be felt that they lose their original point. Whether it is worth the sacrifice involved, to achieve the material benefit for human dignity, is not for a lawyer to say.

# Regional human dignity?

Thus far, I have addressed the interpretation of human rights treaties at the international, that is, global, level. The question remains whether different considerations apply at the regional level, in particular in Europe, the location that may hold greatest interest for readers of this volume. Does human dignity have a distinct regional meaning in the European human rights system that differs from its meaning in the international human rights system? That possibility should not be dismissed: if the legal content of human dignity can vary from one national constitutional system to another, then the legal content of human dignity norms may also vary as between more inclusive and more circumscribed human rights systems. Each system must apply its legal conception of human dignity universally, but the systems may differ in their legal conceptions.

Interestingly enough, the European Convention on Human Rights does not contain any operative provision that refers expressly to human dignity, either in the original text or in the subsequent Protocols to date; the first preambular reference to human dignity occurred in Protocol No. 13, adopted in 2002. 23 Nonetheless, the concept of human dignity has long been employed in the interpretation of the Convention. The advent of the German-style guaran-

tee of human dignity in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights will probably increase the reliance on arguments from interpretations of human dignity in the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.24

Might theological understandings of human dignity play a more direct role in the elaboration of human dignity within the European regional system? As a non-European, I approach that question with the hesitancy of an external observer. The earlier comment that all religions have minority status on the global scene holds less force in Europe, at least if Christianity is considered as one religion, and if degrees of secularism are not taken into account;25 even then, the Council of Europe does include countries where Christians amount to a minority. Whether and how the European Court of Human Rights achieves legitimacy for its interpretations with regard to the populations of these countries, and with regard to non-Christian minorities in other states, has been a matter of controversy within the court itself.26

An indirect route to influencing European human rights law may also be utilized, passing through the legal construct of the 'European consensus' .27 Neutrally stated norms addressing human dignity may be enacted at the national level, taking a positive legal form that omits a description of their religious origin or the reasons why they obtained political support. As these enactments accumulate in multiple European states, they may lead to the recognition of a positive European consensus that informs the interpretation of the European Convention. Alternatively, texts negotiated at Council of Europe level are sometimes invoked as evidence of a European consensus. This method of interpretation does not operate mechanically, and it may be combined with or outweighed by other methods of argumentation. Still, on occasion it may transform religious norms into legal facts that generate other positive norms at the regional level.

<sup>25</sup> I recognize that different Christian denominations have different traditions and different approaches to doctrinal authority, and that these divergences (as well as others) may result in different accounts of human dignity. As a nonspecialist, I will not attempt to describe them.

<sup>26</sup> See, for example, *Ley/a Sahin v Turkey,* 2005-XI ECtHR, App. No. 44774/98 (Grand Chamber) (dissenting opinion ofJudge Tulkens); *Serife Yigit v Turkey,* 2010- ECtHR, App. No. 3976/05 (Grand Chamber) (concurring opinion of Judge Kovler).

Carozza, 'Uses and misuses of comparative law in international human rights: Some reflections on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights', *Notre Dame LawReview73* (1998), 1217.

The mere existence of a European consensus, however, is not a strong argument for the subsequent transfer of an interpretation of human dignity from the European regional system to the international human rights system. Regional human rights norms do sometimes become starting points for interpretations of human rights treaties at the international level. In supra positive terms, a European norm and the reasons supporting it may inspire a similar development if the reasons prove persuasive to a global audience. In institutional terms, a European norm may indicate a practical and effective solution to a human rights problem, and the solution may be sufficiently adaptable to non-European states to lead to its employment at the global level as well. But it is the rationale attributable to the norm, rather than the consensus that produced it, that would justify its global influence. That rationale must involve generalizable arguments that can be addressed to a religiously diverse humanity.
