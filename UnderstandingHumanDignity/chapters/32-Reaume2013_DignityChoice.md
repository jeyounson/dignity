# **Dignity, Choice, and Circumstances**

#### *Denise Reaume*

DIGNITY IS AT LEAST in part about choice.1 It is bound up with autonomy, and autonomy is about being able to make choices about the character and direction of one's life. Yet many do not live in autonomy fostering circumstances, but must still make choices, choices that shape the ongoing quality and character of their lives, and may bring them into contact or conflict with legal institutions. Such choices and the circumstances that shape them are often the context of contests over social and economic rights, by which I refer loosely to the web of arrangements meant to secure decent living conditions and security of membership in a society. These issues can arise not only in the constitutional context but also in the interstices of ordinary lawmaking and adjudication.

All too often, legislators and judges take the easy way out in resolving such contests, ratifying the choices made by desperate people as though they were autonomous and free. In doing so, they sometimes claim to be respecting the dignity of those whose choices they treat as grounding responsibility. Alternatively, the law sometimes responds to bad choices by constructing a category of' defective' people who must have decisions made for them. These unfortunates are treated as wards of the state rather than agents in their own right, and this is often described as responding to need. Rather than respecting dignity; both responses add insult to injury. The first assigns blame rather than investigating the obstacles to healthy choices and the role of the legal system in their manufacture and maintenance. The second shows some sympathy for disadvantageous circumstances, but at the cost of depriving people of a say in their lives.

Thus the law seems to be caught up in a dilemma. Either we honour the choices of those with the legal status to choose by imposing responsibility for

<sup>1</sup> I emphasize that dignity is *in part* about choice, for there are many life circumstances in which individuals are incapable of choice--the very young, those in a comatose state, those suffering serious dementia-in which facilitating choice is not the issue and yet there are claims of dignity demanding satisfaction. Nevertheless, being able to make decisions for oneself is an important part of our concept of dignity and deserves, I think, the kind of specific focus I give it here.

them, and in so doing refrain from responding to real need or doing something about the circumstances that foster bad choices, or we pay more attention to the circumstances of choice and give little weight to the exercise of agency, and thereby stigmatize certain people as incapable of choosing for themselves. Either way, we do harm to the ideal of honouring the capacity for choice that is part of the modern conception of human dignity. The only way out of the dilemma is, first, to address social conditions that deprive some people of the option of a fully autonomous life, and second, in the meantime, to recognize the capacity for agency that people have at whatever level they have it arid seek to work with them at that level to improve their ability to make the decisions that affect the quality of their lives.

Through an examination of three brief case studies, this chapter illustrates very different legal contests in which the meaning of dignity is part of the debate. Governments tend to understand dignity as simple respect for choice, and when that seems implausible, they shift to patronizing people as incapable of choice. Both seem to be ways of avoiding accepting responsibility for the ways in which social and economic conditions supported by the state contribute to a state of affairs that deprives some of the conditions of autonomy. Against this, advocates for disadvantaged groups try to direct our attention to whether the conditions of choice are adequate to support dignity, but many legal systems present scant opportunity directly to shape disputes around this issue. In an inhospitable legal climate, there nevertheless emerges in these cases an understanding of how we might better support dignity even in trying circumstances without depriving people of all means of choice. The chapter sketches these contesting visions in order to demonstrate the need for· a more nuanced way to talk about need and choice at the same time. That effort is both grounded in and contributes to the development of a richer conception of dignity that could guide legal reasoning across a variety of contexts.

#### Dignity, autonomy, and law

In its modern usage, dignity is bound up with our attribution of inherent worth to human beings. To ascribe dignity to human beings as a moral matter is to treat human beings as creatures of intrinsic, incomparable, and indelible worth, simply as human beings. 2 Because this notion of dignity is independent

<sup>2</sup> Aurel Kolnai, 'Dignity', in RobinS. Dillon (ed.), *Dignity. Character, and Self-Respect* (New York, Routledge, 1995), 56, nicely captures the non-derivative nature of this kind of worth: 'If Dignity means "being worthy of ... ", the completion that most aptly suggests itself would seem to be "worthy of being appreciatively acknowledged *as* worthy to be thus acknowledged and appreciated, *sans plus".'* 

of the empirical attributes of particular individuals-their talents, skills, and ambitions-it is akin to the attribution of status, packaging together a range of norms about rights and obligations, appropriate forms of treatment, and access to opportunities, goods, and benefits.3 These make concrete the entitlements flowing from the attribution of dignity and thereby give it shape. The distinctive ethos of the modem era is to develop this conception of dignity in an egalitarian direction. The hierarchies of rank that have characterized other eras have been repudiated.4 We now share a single status, are now all owed 'equal concern and respect' in Ronald Dworkin's words.5

Full equality of status at the formal level has been achieved at least since the eradication of slavery and the enfranchisement of all adult citizens.6 However, as T. H. Marshall so aptly noted long ago, the content of the 'status' of bearer of dignity (Marshall would have said 'citizenship') has been evolving over the modem period, the rights entailed gradually being enriched to achieve a 'fuller measure of equality' .7 No doubt Marshall imagined that the flowering of full citizenship would be a smoother, more linear process than it has been. As it has turned out, states have been quicker to universalize civil and political rights as part of our conception of dignity than to attend to the social and economic institutions that Marshall had in mind as necessary to the enrichment--one might say fulfilment--of that status. 8 Even when key benefits have been put in place, such as public education, labour rights, public health care, and social assistance, these have often not been entrenched; rather, governments have given themselves the freedom to stall progress, even

<sup>4</sup> Walrlron; 'Does "equal moral status" add anything to right reason.' Waldron usefully distinguishes between conditional status and sortal status, the latter demarcating what is understood to be a distinction between types of people, rather than differences in condition. It is all too easy, though, for differences in condition to attract legal rules and structures that create something very close to a sortal status even as the legal system congratulates itself on having transcended this sort of thinking.

<sup>6</sup> This claim is, of course, too strong, since it brackets the situation of refugees and illegal immigrants, a key site of disputes over status and the meaning of dignity likely to occupy us for some time. Indeed, one might argue that a conception of dignity as a form of status fits too readily into statist conceptions of membership, reinforcing the outsider status of illegal immigrants. This raises important challenges for dignity, but ones beyond the purview of this paper.

to turn back the clock by reducing or eliminating entitlements, and in recent decades have not been shy about using this freedom. Indeed, even entrenchment does not guarantee that effective implementation will follow. 9

The extension of legal and civil rights to all is grounded in the value of personal autonomy, and the legal recognition of these rights has been part of the process of constructing the modern conception of dignity. The priority given to these rights reflects one particular aspect of autonomy, and builds it into the idea of moral status. These specific rights protect a range of impor-. tant choices, and well before they were extended to all they had come to be bound up with what it means to be a full member of society, a bearer of dignity. To have any of these rights taken away would clearly be treated as an assault on one's dignity. To be treated as though incapable of making these sorts of choices was a mark of inferiority. Their extension was an important step towards a more egalitarian conception of dignity.

For example, what marked the division of men and women into two separate and hierarchically ordered classes of human being was the systematic denial of autonomy to women through the denial of these rights. Without the right to own property, to enter into contract, to vote, to enjoy decision-making power over person or family, to pursue education, to enter many parts of the paid workforce, women's lives were severely and comprehensively circumscribed, confined to a narrow range of roles that were socially and legally sanctioned. The distinct and lesser status to which women were assigned operated by formally denying many choices so that only specific others were available. As these constraints began to be seen as constraints, rather than as a reflection of women's nature, it became imperative to extend the basic roster oflegal and civil rights to women. The removal oflegal constraints opened up choice and allowed women more autonomy, and thereby s!gnalled the legal system's respect for women as beings able to formulate and execute the full range of human plans and projects.

9 De Bllrca and de Witte, *Social Rights in Europe.* A small but stark recent example of the fragility of social and economic rights is provided by the Report of the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food on his recent visit to Canada (6-16 May 2010). Olivier de Schutter recorded the widening gap between rich and poor and the rising rate of food insecurity in contravention of Canada's international hnrnan rights obligations. The report is available http://www.srfood.org/index.php/enlcomponent/content/ article/ 1-latest -news/225 3 -canada-national-food-strategy-can-eradicate-hunger-amidst-plentyun-rights-expert. For his trouble, de Schutter was insulted by at least two federal cabinet ministers, his findings dismissed out of hand as illegitimate interference by an. outsider. See CBC News, 'UN official sparks debate over Canadian food security' (16 May 2012), http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ story/2012/05/16/pol-un-canada-food-security.htrnl; Heather Scoffield, 'Ottawa shrugs off UN warning on hunger and nutrition', *Globe and Mail* (16 May 2012), http://www.theglobeandmail.corn!news/ politics/ottawa-shrugs-off-un-waming-on-hunger-and-nutrition!article2434556/.

In tum, this fostered in women a new sense of self-respect as the kind of person who could exercise these rights. Two aspects of personality reinforce one another here. Human beings are reflective beings, capable of making and changing plans, seeing themselves as individuals and in relationship with others. Thus, respect for identity is crucial to respect for dignity, and to demean characteristics integral to identity is a key form of indignity. We are also capable of formulating and acting on a conception of 'the good'. Thus, respect for people's ability to formulate and execute plans and projects is relevant to protecting dignity. These two aspects of personality are connected: 10 one develops an identity partly through the life one creates, and a conception of the good partly in the context of one's sense of who one is. Thus, to restrict the plans and dreams of individuals either creates a mean sense of self, if people have never been allowed to glimpse what is denied them, or demeans and demoralizes individuals who can see their way clear to a richer life that is denied them." If this sort of comprehensive disrespect for dignity is organized so as to affect individuals who are recognized as members of a group of some sort, it is very easy to create new forms of second-class status, even without intending to or fully realizing it.

The elimination of formal structures of cpnstraint is, of course, of crucial importance in the movement towards a universal conception of dignity. But it is trite political sociology that the end of legal prohibitions does not necessarily make opportunities available in fact. Legal rules and restrictions are hardly the only forces capable of creating a more or less comprehensive web of constraints that can confine the life choices and chances of some, and, in tum, cramp their sense of self. The construction of the welfare state was meant to deal with some of the other autonomy-restricting forces operative in the modem world-ignorance, poverty, ill health, exploitation. But the task was and is a large and complex one and the merry-go-round of life cannot simply-be stopped until we have got it right. So legislators go on enacting laws prohibiting some behaviour, encouraging or mandating others, and judges go on deciding individual cases in accordance with such laws. Having made the mistake before of subjecting different classes of people to different rules, and thus creating different statuses, the new world view starts from the premise

<sup>10</sup> Martha Nussbaum makes a similar_ point in her identification of two human capabilities-affiliation and practical reason-that are 'of special importance, since they both organize and suffuse all the others, making their pursuit truly human': Martha Nussbaum *Women and Human Development: The Capabilities Approach* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2000), 82.

<sup>11</sup> Thus, Bernard Williams argues that respect for human beings as conscious being entails a prohibition on treatment that is exploitative or that destroys the capacity for reflection. Williams, 'The idea of equality', in Pojman and Westmoreland, *Equality: Selected Readings,* 95.

that everyone should be subjected to the same rules, more or less. This is meant to reflect their dignity, their equal moral status. As the project of reducing social and economic inequality stumbles uncertainly forward, or even slips back, formal equal treatment against the backdrop of ongoing conditions of inequality often helps reinforce inequality even as we continue, enthusiastically or grudgingly, as the case may be, to construct the kinds of social institutions that are meant to level the playing field.

Cecile Fabre makes a similar point. Meditating on the idea of treatment with 'equal concern and respect', she distinguishes between showing concern. and showing respect. 12 The latter evokes the choosing side of our moral status; . concern, on the other hand, speaks to having regard for the interests or wellbeing of all. Generalizing her point about European constitutions, we might say that modern societies tend more enthusiastically to embrace respect than concern as aspects of the dignity of human beings. They enact general rules proscribing and prescribing, thereby creating a legal framework within which choices are judged, but pay little attention to underlying conditions in which . choices are made.

When legislators adopt a uniform rule applicable to all, they inevitably assume a set of standard characteristics for those they imagine to be subject to the law. This includes a level of control over one's actions and circumstances consistent with staying out of legal trouble. They assume that those subject to the law can stay on its right side if they would. They have in mind a hypothetical subject who can and should be guided by the law. But it is often the case that the attributes of this hypothetical subject turn out to mirror those of people who have enjoyed conditions of security, who have not been subjected to severe disadvantage and deprivation. It should not, therefore, be surprising that many who fall foul of such laws have not enjoyed the luxury of the level of security attributed to the reasonable subject. Some may work that much harder to conform to the law's strictures and manage to succeed, but some will inevitably be unlucky or unwise and will fail. When they do, they will often be. treated simply as the authors of their own misfortUne, to be held responsible for their own choices.

But, of course, legislation doesn't always enact uniform rules; nor do judges always insist on uniform application of the rules. Indeed, sometimes legislation is meant specifically to deal with circumstances that are thought to pertain only to a limited class of persons, including circumstances of disadvantage that impair the ability to lead an autonomous life. Such efforts might be seen as acknowledgement that background social and economic conditions

<sup>12</sup> Cecile Fabre, 'Social rights in European constitutions', in de Bllrca and de Witte, *Social Rights in Europe.* 

needed to support autonomy are either absent or ineffective. The need for such redress after the fact might send policymakers back to the drawing board to repair or extend the web of supports. In fact, laws and judicial decisions meant to address disadvantage often also ratify and entrench it, not by treating the agent as unconstrained and fully responsible but by attributing to the character of a group of people the incapacities imposed on them by circumstances. This is, of course, what the law used to do formally to women-treat various legal incapacities as a reflection of women's distinct nature, as the ground of their different treatment rather than the cause of their inferiority. The law no longer operates comprehensively to create different ranks, but it still operates on the margins to reinforce social forces that manufacture second-class citizens, persons deemed not capable of living up to the standards of full moral agents, persons whose lives must be run for them by people who know better. That this is a violation of dignity we can tell by what our own reaction would be to having important decisions simply taken out of our hands. It is easier to do this to others if we can attribute to them, as an ingrained defect, the effects of their disadvantaged circumstances.

Thus emerges the dilemma: if we simply treat people as responsible for their choices, we punish them for being the victim of autonomy stunting conditions; if we simply take away the power of choice when it is likely to be used badly, we deny the very capacity for choice, and run the risk of stigmatizing vulnerable groups as incapable of choice.

There is much to be said about the concrete forms that social and economic rights should take in order to be fully protective of human dignity. This is one way out of this dilemma, but that is not my area of expertise, and in many jurisdictions we are some way from seeing the kind of political will that encourages blue sky thinking. So, instead, I want to consider how our legal institutions operate in the absence of the kinds of protections that would concretely alleviate disadvantage and enable everyone to live an autonomous life, particularly through the lens of the conception of autonomy and dignity that this practice implies. In the abs\!nce of such protections, people bump into the legal system in all kinds of ways, big and small, and the system has to respond to the consequences of its defects. Having, in a sense, set people up for failure, the legal system must then decide how to treat those who fall down. These are opportunities to study the often impoverished story about autonomy and human dignity embedded in state policy. They also give us glimpses into a richer way to understand dignity even under conditions in which autonomy is impaired.

I will examine three vignettes drawn from Canadian law to illustrate the interplay of competing conceptions of dignity as they emerge in discrete legal

contests. Litigation unfolds on the terrain established by the legislature, however generous or stingy that happens to be, however close to or far from the idea of a robust conception of human dignity. One may therefore look to the terms of the legislation itself to see what conception of dignity it embodies. However, through litigation in these contexts, we occasionally get further insight into the official conception of dignity in the form of the arguments governments make about the rationale or purpose of its legislation. Where an adequate social and economic rights framework is not in place and there exists no constitutional entitlement to it, those affected by inadequate provi- · sian must look for indirect ways to try to vindicate their dignity. Sometimes other human rights can be used as a lens through which indirectly to assess the effectiveness of the social safety net.

Though my vignettes are Canadian in their technical legal details, I expect that the general phenomenon is quite common. I start with two examples of litigation under Canadian human rights instruments that indirectly give us a window onto access to social and economic benefits and their connection to a conception of dignity. These openings at the margins tend to occur because of the invocation of s. 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the right to life, liberty, and the security of the person, and equality rights provisions, whether contained in the Charter (s.15) or statutory human rights codes. 13 Judges are as important as legislators in constructing a concep-. tion of autonomy congruent with human dignity. Because this is so, I will also examine an issue in an area in which judges have traditionally been the primary lawmakers such that *they* must craft the response to human tragedy occasioned by a failure of the state to foster conditions of autonomy.

#### Representing human dignity: three vignettes·

#### *The Insite* case14

Vancouver's downtown east side is a very rough neighbourhood. The Supreme Court of Canada described it as follows:

The DTES [Downtown East Side] is home to some of the poorest and most

<sup>13</sup> For example, the Ontario *Human Rights Code,* R.S.O. 1990 c. H. 19,protects against discrimination on the basis of various traits, such as sex, race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and national or ethnic origin in respect of employment, accommodation, and the provision of services.

<sup>14</sup> *Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services,* 2011, 3 S.C.R. 134, commonly referred to as 'the Insite case' after the name of the safe injection site.

vulnerable people in Canada. Its population includes 4,600 intravenous drug users, which is almost half of the intravenous drug users in the city as a whole. This number belies the size ofthe DTES. It is in fact a very small area, stretching for a few blocks in each direction from its heart at the intersection of Main and Hastings.

There is no single reason for the concentration of intravenous drug users in this urban neighbourhood. Contributing factors include the presence of several single-room occupancy hotels, the de-institutionalization of the mentally ill, the effect of drug enforcement policies over the years, and the availability of illicit narcotics at street level.

The injection drug use problem ofthe DTES is not hidden. At any given time of day drug transactions can be witnessed in the open air on the very steps of the historic Carnegie Community Centre at Main and Hastings. In alleys steps away, addicts tie rubber bands around their arms to find veins in which to inject heroin and cocaine, or smoke crack from glass pipes.

The residents of the DTES who are intravenous drug users have diverse origins and personal histories, yet familiar themes emerge. Many have histories of physical and sexual abuse as children, family histories of drug abuse, early exposure to serious drug use, and mental illness. Many injection drug users in the DTES have been addicted to heroin for decades, and have been in and out of treatment programmes for years. Many use multiple substances, and suffer from alcoholism. Some engage in street-level survival sex work in order to support their addictions. It should be clear from the above that these people are not engaged in recreational drug use: they are addicted. Injection drug use is both an effect and a cause of a life that is a struggle on a day to day basis.

While some affordable housing is available in the DTES, living conditions there would shock many Canadians. The DTES is one of the few places where Vancouver's poorest people, crippled by disability and addiction, can afford to live. Twenty per cent of its population is homeless. Of those who are not homeless, many live in squalid conditions in single-room occupancy hotels. Residents of single-room occupancy hotels live with little in the way of security, privacy or hygienic facilities. The residents of one building often have to share a single bathroom. Single-room occupancy hotels are commonly infested with bedbugs and rats. Existence is bleak. 15

The failures to construct a social safety net recorded here are deep and entrenched.

In the wake of a dramatic rise in the rate of drug-related HIV and hepatitis infections and the number of drug-related deaths in the 1990s, the city and the province of British Columbia decided to change strategy. Instead of treating intravenous drug use exclusively as a law and order issue, they decided to adopt a harm reduction strategy. Convinced that it was pointless simply to tell drug addicts to stop injecting drugs or risk being sent to jail, they decided

15 *Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services,* paras 4-8.

#### 548 *Denise Reaume*

to open a safe injection site, Insite, where addicts could have the use of clean needles and the benefit of medical supervision. Insite does not provide the drugs and its staff does not administer them; it merely provides a safe environment for their use, and the availability of medical care in the event of mishap. The clinic is not for recreational users but for those suffering from addiction. 16

Operation of the scheme requires the cooperation of the federal government because federal law criminalizes the possession of narcotics. This put the staff of Insite at risk of being charged simply by virtue of running the place where drugs are being used, and, of course, the users themselves could be subject to prosecution. But the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act17 contains a ministerial power to exempt a person or establishment from the operation of the Act. Insite operated from 2003 until 2008 under the protection of an exemption; then the Minister of Health in a newly elected Conservative government rejected Insite's application for renewal of its exemption. That decision was challenged by Insite staff and clients claiming that the minister's refusal violated their right to life, liberty, and security of the person protected by s. 7 of the Charter.

The minister's defence of his actions illustrates the approach to autonomy that simply refuses to take account of the compromised circumstances of choice of disadvantaged people. The argument was simple: whatever health risks drug users suffer in the absence of a safe injection site are not caused by the prohibition on the possession of drugs kept in force by the minister's refusal but by their decision to use illegal drugsY Non-medicinal use of narcotic drugs is a criminal offence, and anyone in possession of prescribed drugs should bear criminal responsibility for his or her actions. 19 This was the position adopted despite the finding of the trial judge that addiction is an illness accompanied by the risk of serious infection and overdose. 20

It is evident that the typical story of addiction in this neighbourhood shows it to be, at least in part, a product of a web of disadvantaging circum" stances that might lead almost anyone to take to drugs. Once one becomes addicted, the spiral is inexorably downward absent assistance. Yet the federal government's response was to blame the people for their own predicament and leave them to a bleak future of incarceration, disease, and death. This is

<sup>16</sup> The Supreme Court notes, *Canada (Attorney General) v PHS Community Services,* at para. 17, that 'Users must be 16 years of age or over, must sign a user agreement, release and consent form, must agree to adhere to a code of conduct, and cannot be accompanied by children. Users must register at each visit to the site and each is asked to identity the substance that will be injected.'

the response of a government with its back up. Unwilling to accept that there is any state responsibility for the conditions that foster addiction, the government had to shove all the responsibility onto addicts themselves.

Ultimately, the minister's complete deflection of causal responsibility was rejected by the court, which held that Insite's clients' security interests were impaired by the refusal to exempt the clinic from the operation of the Act.21 The court went on to hold that this infringement was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice because the minister's decision was incons.istent with the public health objectives of the Act rather than in furtherance of them. All the evidence in the case supported the conclusion that Insite saved lives and reduced infection rates, and did so without increasing drug consumption. 22

There is an important lesson about autonomy and dignity in the philosophy adopted by lnsite. It is significant, I think, that the clinic has abandoned a strategy ofmerely assigning blame for drug use in favour of working through the capacity for agency exhibited by the addicted population, impaired though it is, to help DTES residents help themselves. Traditional approaches to addiction tend to combine criminalization with making treatment conditional on giving up drugs for good. Insite was part of a coordinated strategy to provide care at whatever stage the person is at in his or her battle with drugs. The idea is to promote better health in whatever way possible to enable those addicted to drugs to move towards dealing with their addiction at whatever is possible for them. The project now includes a detox facility to support those ready to try living drug free. This seems to me a better way to promote progress towards a fully autonomous life. It acknowledges the burdens that those addicted to drugs labour under but still treats them as capable of making decisions to advance their own well-being. It supports them in the effort to advance towards their own objectives rather than imposing society's objectives on them. Nor was the significance of this philosophy lost on its clients. As Dean Edward Wilson, one of the litigants, put it: 'Insite has given dignity to people who have to struggle to have their humanity recognized. '23

The Insite litigation offers us a stark contrast between a government policy that assumes autonomy and seeks to punish those who choose to break the rules and a philosophy that is determined to treat addicts as agents, although in need of assistance to enable them to choose well. The former refuses to acknowledge the systemic failures that help create addiction, and

can therefore only affirm the dignity of choice by punishing bad choices; the latter acknowledges the background problems and seeks to do what can be done in the circumstances to move people forward, while still affirming their dignity as agents.

#### **Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program) v Tranchemontagne24**

Welfare reforms in Ontario in the mid-1990s, not unlike many jurisdictions, created two streams of recipients. Recreating for the twenty-first century the Victorian distinction between the 'deserving and undeserving poor', those with disabilities of a certified type and severity were entitled to one scheme of benefits (ODSP),25 while others were relegated to another (OW).26 The former scheme was more generous in the level of support it provided;27 the latter imposed the additional requirement of participation in treatment or training programmes in preparation for entering the workforce on pain of being cut off benefit altogether. The rules dividing potential income support recipients into one of these two classes excluded from eligibility for ODSP a group who would otherwise be classified as disabled, but whose only disability involved addiction to drugs or alcohol. These people were therefore lumped in with those subjected to the lower benefit levels and compulsory work-readiness programmes of OW. This exclusion from ODSP was challenged as discriminatory under the Ontario Human Rights Code in that it discriminated against those with a specific disability, treating them differently from other disabled persons.

Ultimately the complaint was successful, but the government's argument in defence of its legislation illustrates a variant on the ways that the meaning and value of autonomy is often distorted under the guise of protecting human dignity. Taking the legislation itself together with the government's defence of it at trial we see a mixture of punitive and patronizing impulses. Together they disguise rather than confront the real causes of poverty and offer insult to the actual capacities of its victims even as the government claims to help them.

27 I should note that even the more generous ODSP could hardly be called generous. The full amount (\$959 per month) left recipients below the poverty level. OW benefits were roughly 60 per cent of that (\$535 per month).

Social Benefits Tribunal, File No. 9910-07541R 0050-04579, aff'd, *Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program) v Tranchemontagne* (2009), 95 OR (3d) 327 (Ont. Div. Ct.), aff'd Ontario (Director, Disability Support Program) v Tranchemontagne, 2010 ONCA 593.

The legislation was carefully tailored to remove from disability support only those whose sole source of disability was alcohol or drug addiction where the addictive substance was not a prescription drug. Reading between the lines, the message is clear: those who are addicted to a substance which they chose to consume rather than having become addicted as a side-effect of treatment for some non-self-inflicted injury or illness were to be treated as not 'really' disabled. Rather, they could be considered responsible for their predicament because oftheir earlier choice. In this respect, the legislation reveals an attitude similar to that of the federal government in refusing to permit the operation oflnsite. But the government's response to the discrimination complaint adds a further layer that is revealing.

The court framed the test for discrimination as follows: did the legislation treat those with a particular disability differently from others so as to violate human dignity? The government argued that there was no violation of dignity in the exclusion of addicts from the more generous benefit scheme because they were included in a scheme that better met their needs. That is, the government claimed that it was taking account of the addicts' current circumstance of impaired autonomy and responding appropriately. The claim was twofold: first, the government claimed that all those who suffered only from addiction were capable of employment and therefore would be better off being required to participate in programmes designed to get them back in the workforce; second, the government claimed that a significantly lower monthly amount of support would preserve addicts from the temptation to spend some of their income on alcohol or drugs.

Notice how this scheme works: based on an apparent assumption of conditions that uniformly foster autonomy, consumption of non-prescription drugs and the abuse of alcohol is judged to be a bad choice. On the surface, the legislation might be read as saying that those who make such choices should simply be held responsible and denied full social assistance benefits. But, perhaps wary of appearing to adopt a punitive approach towards a group of disabled people, the government's justification of the scheme claimed to recognize their special needs-by taking decision-making about how to return to health and employability away from them. The policy implies that it is necessary to force addicts to participate in work-readiness schemes because they will not do so of their own choice; likewise, they must be deprived of the means of making further bad choices by being reduced to a subsistence level of income. Having made bad decisions in the past, the addict's agency is treated as a source of trouble to be controlled by the state. He is to have his choices made for him, and this is justified as an affirmation of his dignity by meeting his special needs.

#### 552 *Denise Reaume*

To be sure, those suffering from substance addictions face formidable challenges in staying healthy and holding down a job. And it is not wrong for social programmes to take these challenges into account; indeed, it is necessary. But the dignity-affirming way to do so is to work through and with whatever capacity for agency the participant in the programme has to support the making of good choices rather than taking over the direction of their lives so that they can make no further mistakes. In this respect, the government of Ontario could learn something from the creators of the Insite clinic.

The full import of the combination of punitive and patronizing measures · is brought home when we realize that this is the regime that applies to *all* nondisabled social assistance applicants. To claim discrimination, those suffering from addiction had to claim that as disabled people they should not be lumped in with the 'undeserving poor'. The Human Rights Code provided no remedy for others tagged as 'undeserving'. The scheme assumes that anyone able to work but not in paid employment must be forced to participate in workreadiness programmes to push them into the workforce, and in the meantime be given a meagre allowance so that they have a further incentive to take whatever work is available. Poor people are treated as incompetent in the first instance, needing the government to tell them how to achieve self-sufficiency. Ifthey resist any ofthe 'advice', they are treated as dishonest or incorrigibly lazy. Nowhere in this picture is there a recognition of the way social and economic policy shapes the work opportunities of the poor. However, there is plenty of evidence that social assistance recipients are eager to work and to better themselves-the problem has more to do with a dearth of jobs that pay a living wage than with the fecklessness of the poor.28

Thus, the help offered becomes merely a test of the recipient's submission. Failure to comply becomes an excuse for punishment. The risk is that these layered forms of disrespect may contribute to the construction of a new type of second-class citizen. The mix of punitive attitudes and controlling impulses often embedded in social assistance legislation risks turning poverty into a status, a set of entrenched characteristics attributed to the poor, rather than a set of social and economic circumstances that inflict sub-standard living conditions on people. The law casts widespread aspersion on the choices and capacities for choice of poor people. These meanings are not lost on other members of the public, whose own prejudices are thereby reinforced. And because the poor are deemed to be unworthy of making their own decisions,

they are subjected to harsh conditions designed to control them. These conditions reinforce their powerlessness. The low rates paid out to able-bodied recipients leave them constantly at risk of hunger, illness, and homelessness, and therefore ill-equipped for full participation in the work force. One mistake is likely to have catastrophic results. The job training they are offered typically prepares them only for the lowest paid jobs, jobs with no benefits, no security, and no hope for advancement. People are not lifted out of poverty; they are just removed from the welfare rolls. The government programme becomes part of the problem rather than part of a solution. Indeed, the lines drawn by the policy and pre-existing sources of inequality reinforce one another to entrench indignity, making it harder, not easier, for the poor to achieve control of their own lives.

#### **The criminalization of victims of domestic violence29**

My third example examines cases in which women have had to defend themselves against criminal charges when they have killed or attempted to kill an abusive partner. Here, the prohibition against violence is meant to be of general application, but there are several defences available which provide at least an opportunity to raise extenuating circumstances. This provides another context in which to examine how well the legal system responds to disadvantaged circumstances that are at least in part created by a social and economic rights vacuum. The state is not responsible for abusive spouses, but it is responsible for securing the safety of those at risk of violence, both through an appropriate police response to domestic violence and the provision of the assistance needed to enable abused women to extricate themselves from violent relationships. Most states fall seriously short in providing the needed support in both respects. This leaves the courts to clean up the mess when a woman takes-matters into her own hands and uses violence herself when she can see no other way out. Should she be held responsible for her choice, or should her desperate circumstances be taken into account?

The Canadian case law in this area is instructive in several ways. Although the courts have shown a willingness to consider the specific context of domestic violence, the way they have done so has sometimes been to treat the accused's response as stemming from a weakness in her-understandable, perhaps, and therefore excusable, but nevertheless a defect *in her.*  Downplayed in the analysis is the inadequacy of measures to protect women

from violence in the first place. If we can see our way clear to relieving her of responsibility by merely declaring her to be defective in some way, we do not have to consider the that give rise to the tragedy. In the meantime, little progress seems to be made in providing greater protection and facilitating escape. Therefore, the cases keep coming and, as will pen, they provide the courts with a series of difficult doctrinal issues within criminal law. It seems likely that sooner or later the ingenuity of the criminal lawyers will run out, leaving women subject to criminal punishment because they could find no legal way out of a violent relationship. ,

This issue first came before the Supreme Court of Canada in *R. v Lavallee,30* in which a woman who had shot and killed her abusive husband pleaded self-defence. Her counsel introduced expert psychiatric evidence ostensibly to assist the jury in understanding the psychological effects of long-term abuse. 31 Over the Crown's objections, he led evidence about what had been labelled 'battered woman syndrome' to help explain the accused's behaviour.32 The Supreme Court held the evidence to be admissible because it could help disabuse the jury of common myths and stereotypes about domestic violence, such as the view that the abuse claimed could not have been very bad or the woman would have left, or that if she stayed anyway she must be a masochist. 33 That is, the court recognized that a jury might need help not to fall into the trap of assuming that a choice not to leave was free.

The court held that the evidence may be relevant to the question of whether the accused believed on reasonable grounds that it was not otherwise possible to preserve herself from death or grievous bodily harm. 34 In *Lavallee,*  the expert psychiatric evidence described victims of abuse as suffering from 'learned helplessness' -the effect of repeated violence is to induce 'an amotivational state, if you will, where it feels there no power and there's no energy to do anything' .35 The court held that this could help explain why the accused

<sup>30 [1990]1</sup> S.C.R. 852.

<sup>31</sup> He thought, probably correctly, that he could not adduce evidence of the social and economic obstacles to leaving a violent relationship. Thanks to Martha Shaffer for pointing this out.

<sup>33</sup> *Lavallee,* [1990]1 S.C.R. 852, 873.

<sup>34</sup> The court also held that the evidence was relevant to self-defence because it could inform whether the accused had a reasonable apprehension of death at the hands of the deceased, since evidence shows that the victim of abuse typically has a heightened sensitivity to the cycle of violence typical of the relationship. Where an outsider may not perceive the deceased's behaviour as threatening, the accused may know better.

felt she could not just leave. In other words, the effect of the violence was to turn the accused into a kind of zombie, *unable* to choose to leave.

Ultimately, Angelique Lavallee was acquitted, but the limits of criminal law doctrine required presenting victims of domestic violence as suffering from a 'syndrome', a psychological condition explaining what to 'normal' people would seem like unreasonable behaviour. Although there is ample evidence that in many cases of domestic violence the victim really has no means of escape, this is not evidence that can be directly led in order to ground a self-defence plea. In fact, the only mention in the decision of the background circumstances that conspire to keep women in abusive relationships is Justice Wilson's brief mention that 'environmental factors may also impair the woman's ability to leave-lack of job skills, the presence of children to care for, fear of retaliation by the man, etc. may each have a role to play in some cases'. 36 Missing from the list are inadequate police response when women do complain of abuse, unavailability of emergency shelters for women and their children so that they have a safe place to go, assistance in finding permanent housing, and income assistance for those who are not in paid employment. 37 All these are plausible aspects of women's right to security of the person and the material conditions that would make it real. Yet they are beyond the purview of the decision about whether the defence of self-defence is available. So instead of being treated as someone who realistically took her circumstances into account and made a rational decision, an abused woman is excused because the abuse she had suffered made her unable to do that rational thing.

Indeed, since *Lavallee,* many feminist criminal law scholars have complained of the tendency oflower courts to treat 'battered woman syndrome' as a kind of disease which a women pleading self-defence must prove she suffered from, which disease is bound up with particular indicia ofhelplessness.38 In other words, the idea that the accused must show that there is something wrong *with her* in order to use the defence had become built into the doctrine. Given the ways, historically, in which weakness in individual women has been readily converted into an integral aspect of all women's nature, this was especially dangerous. To its credit, the Supreme Court has tried to counter this tendency, Justice L'Heureux-Dube, in *R. v Malott,* warning as follows:

<sup>36</sup> Quoted in *Lavallee* [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852,887.

<sup>37</sup> Melanie Randall, 'Equality rights and the charter: reconceptualizing state accountability for ending domestic violence', in F. Faraday eta!. (eds), *Making Equality Rights Real, Securing Substantive Equality Under the Charter,* 2nd edn (Toronto, Irwin Law, 2009), 275.

<sup>38</sup> See for example, Martha Shaffer, 'The battered woman syndrome revisited: some complicating thoughts five years after *R. v Lavallee',* University of Toronto Law Journal47 (1997), I; Isabel Grant, 'The "syndromization" of women's experience', in Donna Martinson eta!., 'A forum on *Lavallee v R.:*  women and self-defence', *UBC Law Review* 25 (1991), 23.

By emphasizing a woman's 'learned helplessness', her dependence, her victimization, and her low self-esteem, in order to establish that she suffers from 'battered woman syndrome', the legal debate shifts from the objective rationality of her actions to preserve her own life to those personal inadequacies which apparently explain her failure to flee from her abuser. Such an emphasis comports too well with society's stereotypes about women.39

This shows some sensitivity to the constraints under which abused women act, and a willingness to treat their behaviour as 'objectively rational' in the circumstances. It tries to restore some dignity to abused women. However, it does not do justice to the complex agency displayed by women trying to protect themselves from violence in intimate relationships. They often put enormous energy into planning and strategizing to minimize the harm to themselves and their children.40 This includes seeking help from the authorities, help that is all too often denied.

The Supreme Court seems to have glimpsed this heroic effort, and for that reason wants to avoid imposing criminal responsibility. However the fact remains that judicial decisions contain only the slimmest acknowledgement that environmental factors are pervasive and powerful, and some of them are. the responsibility of the authorities to counteract. This larger context is crucial to moving in a direction that would meaningfully support women's autonomy. One demonstration of the inadequacy of finding what space there is the criminal law of defences is that women in desperate circumstances do ingly desperate things, and there is only so far that the criminal law can be stretched. The Supreme Court has just handed down a decision in the case of *R. v Ryan,41* in which the accused woman was charged with counselling a third party (who was in fact an undercover officer) to murder her abusive husband. Nicole Doucet (formerly Ryan) had recently separated.from her: husband after years of abuse, yet he continued to stalk her and threaten her ·anp her daughter . ' . with death. She claimed that she made several reports to the police and other agencies of this threatening behaviour, but no action was taken. Each time she was told it was a 'civil matter'. In this case, there is a very direct link between the state's failure to protect and Doucet's decision to take matters into her own hands. But because she asked someone else to do the killing, it is not clear

<sup>39</sup> *R v Malott* [1998] 1 SCR 123, para. 41. Indeed, Justice L'Heureux-Dube went on to draw attention to the brief passage quoted above from *Lavallee* referring to environmental factors helping to explain why women do not leave ab11sive This seems calculated, since it is fair to say that at the time that *Lavallee* was handed down, one might have been forgiven for not having noticed the passage at all.

that self-defence is available, leading the trial judge to acquit on the basis of duress. The Supreme Court rejected this line of defence, holding that duress applies only to morally involuntary actions; Doucet's husband did not compel her to attempt to inflict harm on him. Nevertheless, the court entered a stay of proceedings on the grounds that the law of duress had been sufficiently unclear that the trial had been conducted solely around its availability. The court did not think a new trial would be fair, citing the enormous toll that the abuse and the trial had taken on. Doucet and 'the disquieting fact that, on the record before us, it seems that the authorities were much quicker to intervene to protect Mr. Ryan than they had been to respond to her request for help in dealing with his reign of terror over her'. 42

Fascinating as all this may be in doctrinal terms, one nevertheless wants to weep at the prospect of another abused woman having to fight for her liberty and at the need to devote considerable ingenuity to her defence, when what is really needed is a strategy to force police and other social service agencies to take domestic violence seriously so that its victims don't have to kill and take their chances in a criminal prosecution.

### Conclusion

Personal autonomy-being able to live self-directed lives-is integral to our conception of dignity. For its sake, states must attend to the materials and social conditions that make autonomy possible. The vignettes presented above are just three tiny examples of how, in the absence of the right kind of autonomy-protecting programmes, the legal system must deal with myriad controversies in which a hapless individual is visited with legal consequences more because he or she was unlucky enough to be caught up in a web of disadvantage than because of his or her own fault. A proper network of social and economic rights cannot prevent all bad things from happening, of course. But its absence seems to tempt governments to deflect blame from themselves to individuals, as in the Insite case, or to seek to control vulnerable individuals in the name of helping them, and in *Tranchemontange,* or risks pathologizing people who had no realistic option in order to avoid blaming them, as in the domestic violence context. These strategies threaten to warp our conception of autonomy and, along with it, our conception of dignity. We can hold onto an understanding of the larger task of putting autonomy-supporting social structures in place by trying to honour the capacity for choosing exhibited by

people even in difficult circumstances. That capacity must be supported not only by the appropriate external conditions but also through its exercise, and that requires sometimes resisting the instinct to control and seeing the situation of choice from the perspective of the disadvantaged. If state actors make the effort to engage with the choices of people as they see them, they would daily be confronted with the gaps in the social safety net, and perhaps be more consistently motivated to do something about them.
