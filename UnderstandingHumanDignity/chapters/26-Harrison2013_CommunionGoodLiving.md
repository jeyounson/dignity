# **'A Communion in Good Living': Human Dignity and Religious Liberty beyond the Overlapping Consensus**

#### *Joel Harrison 1*

THE APPEAL TO HUMAN DIGNITY within religious liberty discourse serves two related purposes. First, it points to at least one, arguably central, reason why religious liberty matters. Judge Marten in the European Court of Human Right's (ECtHR's) foundational Article 9 case, *Kokkinakis,* contended that freedom of thought, conscience, and religion are an essential part of respecting 'human dignity and human freedom' .2 He continued: 'respect for human dignity and human freedom implies that the state is bound to accept that in principle everybody is capable of determining his fate in the way that he deems best' .3 Other courts have reasoned similarly. 4 Second, it gives a basis for regulation. Maclure and Taylor refer to human dignity as a constituent, non-negotiable part ofliberal democracies because, with other core principles, it provides such democracies with 'their foundations and aims' .5 Knowing what is at stake when dealing with claims of religious liberty provides a shared basis, on this argument, for guarding against unwanted, unreasonable forms of religion. Thus, European and United Kingdom case law has held that before a claim-right in respect of religious manifestation can

be heard, the religion in question must first establish that it is compatible with human dignity.6

While these appeals to human dignity-as a basis for religious liberty and as its regulator-are not entirely settled in practice/ they often exhibit a common argument. Human dignity is understood as a central concept shaping the contours of religious liberty, in principle both acceptable to and supported by different traditions. This turns human dignity into a neutral concept, not housed solely in any particular religious tradition but potentially compatible with them. Its content is secular or political, focusing on the freedom of the individual to develop his or her conception of the good.8

This chapter identifies problems with this view of dignity and its relationship to religious liberty. Part I critically questions recent arguments from Jilrgen Habermas, consistent with other writers, that different traditions can cohere around shared political or secular principles, including an understan.ding of human dignity, through acts of translation. I argue that the resulting abstract constitutionalism, construing human dignity in terms of equal concern and respect and moral autonomy supports a particular vision of political and social space in which religion occupies a sphere of choice, individual conscience, or style distinct from politics. Part II discusses problems this view of dignity holds for religious liberty, looking at recent writing from Ronald Dworkin. I contend that Dworkin's view of equal concern and respect potentially contributes to problems in religious liberty discourse by reinforcing a paradigm of individual wills being regulated by the state's overriding and uniform application of rules. Part III challenges the view of dignity put forward by Habermas and Dworkin by contrasting arguments from Christian personalism. Human dignity within this tradition of thought concerns a quest for what Jacques Maritain called a 'communion in good living' .9 Building on this, religious liberty would concern not the pursuit of individual conceptions of the good but rather the formation of bodies or associations in which persons are understood as unique gifts.

# Dignity: the difficulty of translation

Can a religious tradition ground an understanding of human dignity, while accepting human dignity as a critical regulating and secular norm that may stand over and against, or above, the same religious tradition? The question presents, in perhaps a newer form, a much debated problem in religious liberty discourse and political theory. In light of religious and ideological difference, scholars have sought agreement, an overlapping consensus, over what John Rawls called 'constitutional essentials' as the basis for negotiating, and permitting, such difference. 10 Human dignity has been proposed as one such, perhaps central, 'constitutional essential' .11 The basic contention is this: different traditions or world views can agree on the value of human dignity, supporting a 'political' vision in which citizens respect each other's different conceptions of the good and equal rights. 12 From such an overlapping consensus, there can be agreement on certain prohibitions, for example, a prohibition on torture or religious coercion, even though, as David Hollenbach puts it, the 'ultimate significance' of such a prohibition 'is interpreted differently in diverse religious and cultural traditions'. 13 This overlapping consensus argument is, I contend, deeply problematic. Put simply, a religious tradition's own understanding of human dignity may be framed within a competing theopolitical vision, meaning that translation to a political conception entails a loss of meaning. In other words, human dignity if found within a religious tradition may stand over and above that religious tradition, but only in the sense that it challenges that tradition with its own voice-to live up to the fullness of its logics, language, and practices.

In his contribution to this volume, Paolo Carozza has noted several reasons to be sceptical of the overlapping consensus approach. 14 He argues that while there might be welcome practical agreement on the prohibition of certain practices, the extent of agreement is always contestable or potentially thin. What practices should be prohibited (beginning and end of life issues, for example), or their specific scope (what is 'coercion'?), are also subject to the pluralism that precipitates the search for an overlapping consensus.

Here, I want to develop further another point of scepticism Carozza raises: that the abstraction from 'deeper ethical sources' when formulating human rights norms leaves us only within forms of proceduralism. 15 A brief look at Habermas illustrates the problem, both for overlapping consensus arguments and, further, agreement over questions of religious liberty.

Recently, Habermas has stressed the state's interest in engaging religious sources that 'nourish its citizens' consciousness of norms and their solidarity' .16 To what end? For Habermas, the democratic state's political legitimacy rests on a prior 'informal public sphere' in which citizens engage in a dialogue about basic commitments. 17 What results, Habermas argues, is a new form of 'solidarity'. Rather than the unity offered by 'transcendent authority', we find unity in abstract constitutionalism. 18 This is, notably, agreement on 'human dignity' understood as equal concern and respect for individuals' conceptions of the good. 19 For Habermas, then, religion is useful when it helps maintain human dignity, so understood. This, he argues, is a neutral and secular commitment 'transcending the semantic domains of particular religious communities' .20 To transcend itself and reach this vision of human dignity, Habermas argues that a religion must translate its various forms, language, and argument into the secular idiom of equal concern and respect.21 The religion thus comes to understand its own basic commitments as underpinning a more universal 'political' logic.22

The Habermasian, and like-minded, political understanding of dignity depends on the claim that there exists a form of reason, which, shorn of any religious baggage, will satisfy any right-minded individuai.23 Charles Taylor

refers to this as 'ideological Esperanto' .24 Habermas is confident that religious language can be translated into universal secular idiom, or at least that 'reasonable' religious language can be. But Taylor analogizes this apparent process to an older usage of translation-a bishop moving from one diocese to another. 25 Such a translation, he notes, entails 'jumping over the boundary. And, of course, something is left behind. ' 26

How is something 'left behind'? Consider non-coercion in worship. In *Dignitatis Humanae,* the Second Vatican Council declared that the human person 'has a right to religious freedom', supporting this claim by an appeal to the dignity of the person as a bearer of conscience.27 For the Council, this expressed the belief that conscience, entailing a desire to seek truth and pursue the proper ends of life, is moved by and ordered towards God. 28 A person could not be forced against conscience into worship because this would defeat the ends of worship-a subjective assent to one's true end.29 Assuming an absence of coercion, religious liberty is consequently consistent with governmental fostering of the religious life, understood as including the communal pursuit of justice and peace 'which have their origin in men's faithfulness to God' .30 But this understanding of dignity, religious conscience, and the pursuit of true ends is not an anthropocentric right of self-expression.31 It does not, in other words, readily translate into the autonomy-based understanding of dignity proposed in the political account of equal concern and respect. To translate in this manner removes all teleological grammar in favour of a political community whose end is defined, in a proceduralist mode, by an apparent absence of collective or common ends.

Habermas's construal of human dignity and the contrasting construal in *Dignitatis Humanae* can be understood in terms of what Taylor calls 'social imaginaries'. A social imaginary concerns 'the ways people imagine their

social existence, how they fit together with others, how things go on between them and their fellows, the expectations that are normally met, and the deeper normative notions and images that underlie these expectations'. 32 This produces a vision of social and political life, containing an implicit understanding of the ends of community. Both religious liberty and human dignity are likely to be central to this vision. How we imagine the relationships between persons, groups, the body politic, and the state, and all of these to the divine, is the substance of religious liberty discussion. Human dignity raises questions of personhood, the autonomy of individuals and their solidarity with one another, the limits of state power, the dignity of institutions, statuses, or groups, and our connectedness to the divine (whether positively, agnostically, or negatively). On Habermas's construal, dignity as equal concern and respect is the hallmark of the 'modem social imaginary': '[the] idea of society as existing for the (mutual) benefit of individuals, and the defense of their rights' .33 What does this 'imaginary' mean for religious liberty? Dignity takes on the character of bulwark against any religious tradition that would attempt to provide a public vision of justice, solidarity, or the common good that claims an orientation towards true human ends. Further, dignity arguably contributes to understanding religion relativistically as one choice m;nong others. This latter contention is the basis for a substantive critique of dignity in the modem social imaginary, the subject of Part II.

# Human dignity: the individual's capacity for self-definition

Liberal theorists of religious liberty seemingly face a paradox. Religion is understood as *one equal option* among many in an age of pluralism. But we also give or have traditionally given pride of place in constitutional texts to freedom of religion. How can we justifY this privilege? What is religious liberty for? In attempting to resolve, or rather dissolve, this paradox, several writers have recently contended that religion is a species of the wider category of freedom of conscience or self-definition, which, in tum, is understood as the hallmark of human dignity. 34 In itself, this is not entirely new. Commentators have often sought to justifY religious libefo/ as a species of a more general

concern for personal autonomy. 35 But, in this part of the chapter, I contend that there is an increasing awareness of the difficulty posed for religious liberty by such an account. In particular, that it potentially undermines religious groups and dissolves religion into what Taylor calls 'expensive taste'. 36

Dworkin notably has argued that religious liberty is only a species of' ethical freedom'. 37 By 'ethical freedom' he means the freedom of the individual to develop 'convictions' which identify 'the value and point of human life and the relationships, achievements, and experiences that would realize that value in his own life' .38 He argues that, as a matter of justice, the general principle of ethical freedom requires that the government be neutral as between individuals' choices of value. 39 Any special appeal to the value of religion-for example, the Italian authorities hanging crucifixes in public schools, considered in *Lautsi,40* or any form of unique protection-is discriminatory.41 The tolerant secular society does not attach any special value to religion; rather, he argues, what is required is respect for ethical choices or decisions as such.

His construal of human dignity flows from or reinforces this account of ethical freedom and political morality, rejecting a distinct account of religious liberty. In his recent *Justice for Hedgehogs,* Dworkin argues that human dignity consists of two ethical principles: self-respect and authenticity.42 Each person, he writes, must strive for his or her life to be a 'successful performance' (self-respect), identifying 'what counts as success in his own life' through the cultivation of a 'style' (authenticity).43 Political morality consequently consists in respecting human dignity, understood as the individual's capacity to search for and make a judgement as to meaning. He rejects a religious understanding of dignity, often narrowly construing religion in a voluntaristic manner as entailing following the commands of God to act well, like a 'detailed moral rule book'.44 In the absence of this command-based God, which cannot alone give rise to a moral obligation in any event, he asks what morality *really*

requires. *'We* are the planners', Dworkin writes.45 And 'we' consists of a collection of individuals who are each an 'ephemeral singularity'. 46 Each person must, accordingly, as a matter of the ethics of human dignity, seek out a 'style' and 'strive for independence'.47 To do so is to stand heroically in the face of death and a purposeless universe.48

We might consider that Dworkin's argument bears some resemblance to the claim, seen in *Dignitatis Humancie,* that truth requires subjective assent. He emphasises the need for 'moral responsibility' - a person must engage in a search for, reason out of, and integrate convictions that grip him or her as a worthy way of living well.49 This amounts, he argues, to seeking truth; there *is* a way for the person to live a successfullife.50 And, further, he contends that the attempt to live well and go on, hopefully, to establish a good life can be distinguished from triviality - collecting matchbook covers is not 'good in that critical way' .51 Much of this- including his discussion ofthe person's life as performance - could fit with a vision of conscience or the person as orientated towards a true end. But there are also points of contrast, and I suggest these might bear upon religious liberty discourse in problematic ways.

As Patrick Riordan discusses in his contribution to this volume, kin's argument for the individual's 'ethical independence' places considerable emphasis on individual autonomy. 52 Dworkin gives primary attention to *the responsibility to inquire* into successful living, within which the bounds of triviality or possible good ends are not entirely clear. Further, authenticity, he argues, requires that the person escape domination by others. 53 This is not simply a concern for coercion. Rather, the person is robbed of authenticity if certain options for living 'otherwise available' are deemed unworthy or the subject communal disapproval. 54 Combined, these contentions emphasise the individual's capacity for self-definition as the critical hallmark of dignity. And it is this emphasis, coupled with the contention that religion is another form of ethical choice (or even one that should be treated critically), that arguably reinforces contemporary difficulties evident in religious liberty discourse.

Here, I point to two difficulties: first, a 'flattening' dynamic in respect of religious groups; and second, weightless diffuse spirituality.

Each individual is to be accorded equal concern and respect as the abstract bearer of a shared capacity to craft his or her own life. The tension this may cause--of individuals, or individuals collectively in the form of groups, encroaching on each other's autonomy-has, as Taylor has discussed, at times led to an insistence on the uniform application of rules against all groups, understood as promoting the individual's interest in equal citizenship through a central sovereign or general will. 55 Eliminating sites of difference, some have called this modernity's 'flattening' impulse. 56

Consider *Schuth v Germany. 57* The ECtHR decided that Article 8, the right to private and family life, had been violated when a Catholic parish dismissed its organist. Mr Schuth had left his wife and begun a new family life, from the Church's perspective, a relationship of commited adultery. 58 For the Court, Mr Schuth's right to continue this relationship outweighed the competing interests of the Church. This reflects, I suggest, an outworking of the self-definition conception as it relates to the group. The latter's life is understood as a vehicle for balancing individual rights. This might mean it can maintain its ethos, in respect of priests or leaders, for example. 59 But the inquiry requires the Church, as a general rule, to consider Mr Schuth's selfdetermination, whether and how this universal right can be limited. 60 On such a view, the group's ethos (fidelity and right relationship) is taken as ground for suspicion.

The controversy over Catholic adoption agencies can be read in a similar way. 61 Continuing provision of adoption services in the UK was made dependent on all providers not discriminating against prospective parents on the grounds of sexual orientation. The logic is clear. Group claims to religious liberty were dismissed despite any contribution to worthwhile ends, as

the group was construed as subject to (a vehicle for) recognizing individual rights, represented by the state's universal rule. 62

But what of the apparent respect for individual style offered in the capacity-based account of human dignity? Isn't this liberating? Here, I suggest, is a second difficulty worth noting: collapsing religion into a form of style, consistent with appeals to personal autonomy as *the* good, fits comfortably with a diffuse form of spirituality that is weightless against state interests. Dworkin himself wants to ward against triviality, but it is unclear how he maintains the boundary. 63 Consistent with this difficulty, the trajectory of how religion is understood in contemporary cultural and legal terms arguably reflects the modem focus on a capacity for self-definition. We now see the proliferation of individual belief narratives, cultivated by modem technology, the appropriation of religious symbols, the consumption of goods, and the discovery of an inner voice. 64 In religious liberty terms, this is reflected in a capacious understanding of religion and the centrality of individual sincerity (J believe I should or must wear a purity ring or *jilbab,* or set-up my own private *succah).65* As Taylor notes, we can give a critical gloss to this contemporary spirituality. While couched in terms of individual authenticity, autonomy, or experience, it is, he argues, often stimulated by a consumer culture in which people are marshalled by corporations into 'mutual displays' of identity. 66 Indeed, if what matters is the abstract capacity for self-definition or the cultivation of identities, then this is at least consistent with the promotion of a ceaseless variety of options within a market. Again, we can see a flattening potential-the abstract maintenance of a capacity to choose is what matters. At this point, religious liberty faces a dilemma: what weight should be given to such diverse, potentially marketed expressions of style or choice when placed against state interests?67

I am suggesting the individual capacity for self-definition understanding of human dignity has implications for state and, indeed, market power. On this basis, recent interest in revitalizing civil society or group-based understandings of religious liberty is understandable.68 Rivers has argued that in the UK we need to recover a sense of organized religion as representing locations of authority that stand over against the state.69 And, as he intimates in his contribution to this volume, this combines with thinking of religion differently to current thought: 'as (inevitably partial and flawed) responses to what is already externally given' .70 Together this potentially envisages, I suggest, a shift in our social imaginary, how we understand the person, the group, the divine, and their relationship to state power under the rubric of human dignity and religious liberty. One avenue, the subject of Part III, is to explore arguments drawing from Christian personalism.

### Human dignity: the person as gift

As a tradition of thought, personalism points to the uniqueness of the person, understood in communitarian terms. 71 It sits within a family of movements or political ideas: for example, solidarity, social pluralist theories, advocacy of intermediate associations, and subsidiarity.72 In this section, I first provide a general sketch of the contrasting articulation of dignity found in Christian personalist writing. In particular, I will focus on one aspect: how this articulation construes the person as gift. This leads, I argue, to an associational account of religious liberty, one focused on religious organizations instantiating and encouraging a life of charity.

In *The Person and the Common Good,* Maritain aligned the dignity of the person with an eternal vocation: each person has unparalleled dignity because each person is ordained directly to God as his or her absolute end.73 This does not mean, however, merely an extratemporal fate. Rather, Maritain, consistent with later Christian personalist writing, emphasized that ordination to God

is participation in the divine life. 74 God is Trinity: the continual offering of love or mutual bestowing of gifts between three 'persons' .75 It is this life that persons can claim to participate in now. To be human, the personalist account argues, is to be caught up in the economy of God's life of gift (otherwise understood as grace).76 This finds concrete reality in participation in a new body-the body of Christ. 77

The Pauline understanding of the *ecclesia* is central to Christian personalist writing.78 ForSt Paul, the vision of peaceful social life is one body-the body of Christ-made out of 'parts'. 79 The one God is manifested through a diversity of gifts exercised for a social whole, 'given for the common good' in Paul's words. 80 One person is characterized as the 'ear', another as the 'eye', the 'foot', the 'hand' _81 Each person is valued as a unique, complete, and nonsubstitutable reflection or icon of God's grace, offered to others for the purpose of human flourishing. 82 Importantly, this is not a vision of individuals cohering to one single whole. Rather, personalists emphasize that individuals cohere in different, multiple bodies, parts outside the state. The purpose of political authority is to recognize these parts and strive for their coordination in light of the whole body's life, understood as pointing towards charity.83 This entails an act of judgement, for if the diversity of talents or gifts is still to be one body there must be a discerning of right positioning or right order. 84 How,

in other words, do particular institutions or roles-like giving ourselves to one another in marriage, raising a family, becoming educators, or exchanging products and talents (including labour) on just terms-reflect this right order, undoubtedly in creative and different ways?

This vision of dignity-persons as reflections of God's grace, offering themselves as gifts to one another for the formation of a body-points, I suggest, towards religious liberty as fundamental to social life. Concluding Part II of this chapter, I raised the need to characterize religious organizations as representing, or instantiating an authority over against the state. This must mean pointing to a *desirable and true* vision beyond quotidian politics, beyond, that is, the regulation of individual interests through the state and market. The appeal to gift for the formation of a body participates in, I suggest, a recovery of Augustinian themes. Rowan Williams, for example, has argued that the West's historical and contemporary character has been shaped by a Christian conception of 'graded levels of loyalty'. 85 He contends that Christianity set forth a new body entailing the 'optimal exchange' of gifts. 86 This body, he argues, continues to offer a perpetual critique of politics or society understood as merely the 'negotiation of practical goods and balanced self-interests'.87 It points, however dimly, towards a transcendent universalism, understood as 'solidarities' outside of the state and, ultimately, beyond human organization. 88

Manifestly, this account draws from the language and shape of 'Church'. Seeking the divine in community with others is understood as encouraging more generally a life of charity in associational settings that have authority independent of state sanctioning. What then of plural religious traditions and beliefs? Any political and social vision will negotiate difference in terms of its constitutive elements-what the community stands for. 89 In the case of the personalist vision, this includes the dignity of the person as gift, a life of charitable association, and the feature of graded levels of loyalty. But the personalist vision also accepts arguably a greater degree of heterogeneity,

manifested as a plurality of groups, than the equal concern and respect vision. Equal concern and respect renders groups as equivalent, and therefore arguably exchangeable vehicles for individual interests (or the inhibitor of such interests). The personalist vision advances an understanding of groups seeking the divine, and right living in light of this. While there remains a central religious case (rather than a fictitious general religion), those writing in a personalist vein accept that different groups-Muslim mosques or Jewish schools, for example-are reaching at similar goals and often contributing, albeit differently, to an organic whole or quest for human dignity.90 This kind of conversation arguably already occurs among UK religious communities.91

In practical terms, how does this conception of human dignity impact on religious liberty cases? I suggest tentatively a number of possibilities. First, when faced with an individual claiming freedom to manifest a particular belief, we would be much more interested in how this individual claim fits within a wider religious community, rather than sincerity and self-definition.92 Denbigh High School's consultative approach to determining appropriate modest dress for Muslim girls within the local community is favoured over Ms Begum's sincerely held belief that she must wear ajilbab.93 Second, intervening contrary to the self-government of religious associations would be based on whether dignity was being infringed, understood in terms of the group engaging in undesirable social ends that diminish human: flourishing. Mr SchUth's claim would be dismissed.94 To apply a rule requirihg the Church to take account ofMr Schuth's right to continue in his new relatiohship (adultery in the eyes of the Church), even if in certain circumstances such a 'right' is balanced by Church autonomy, problematically undermines the life cif the group, which is purposed towards virtuous social living. Third, participation in the provision of charitable care would not tum on the universal application of what Rivers critically calls an 'individualistic conception ofprovision' .95

Different groups, such as Catholic adoption agencies and state agencies, could be seen as 'parts' with their own integrity pursuing a shared good (stable and loving child rearing) in different, but not incompatible, ways.96 Fourth, while mindful of coercion of worship, the idea of right ordering or the common good means that a community will appropriately recognize in public life its shared meanings, representative objects, persons, and histories.97 Such a shared meaning is likely to have a sacred import-a form of transcendental value beyond the lives of individuals alone. The Grand Chamber in *Lautsi*  was, on this basis, right to leave to Italy the decision 'whether or not to perpetuate a tradition' .98

## Conclusion

I have argued that the search for a neutral principle of human dignity as the source and regulator of religious liberty is illusive. Consequently, I raised two visions or imaginaries for discussion. The self-definition and equal concern and respect vision of dignity, I argued, is problematic for religious liberty. Potentially, it reduces religion to an abstract instance of the individual's capacity for self-definition in a market of choices and gives rise to a flattening impulse, in which the group, rather than being its own site of authority, is understood as the vehicle for abstract individual rights. In contrast, the personalist vision understands human dignity in terms of the person's status as a gift to others and social wholes. This recognizes that we cohere in different, multiple bodies. In religious liberty terms, the personalist account focu.ses on associating well-pursuing virtuous living, the love of God and of neighbour. Such bodies, seeking a common or right order discernible through our different talents and gifts, constitute their own authority, capable of offering resistance to the powerofthe state and market. This, it is hoped, is a faithful image of the person and a possible basis for a revitalized religious liberty discourse.
