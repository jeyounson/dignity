# **Human Dignity, Interiority, and Poverty**

#### *Clemens Sedmak*

#### Human dignity and 'blindness to the human aspect'

A coMMON EVERYDAY FORM of disregard and disrespect of human dignity is the way we treat those around us-as if they were things rather than people. The French socio-anthropologist Anna Sam describes how, in working as a cashier for several years in a supermarket, she was looked at and treated more as an item off the shelf than a living being. 1 She regarded the customer as the greatest 'burden' of the job since she was continually humiliated and looked down upon. Customers were oblivious to the fact that a human individual was operating the till--often ignoring her completely without so much as a look or a word. Payment for goods is frequently carried out like the transaction at a cashpoint machine, with no trace of realization that the cashier is a person, reduced to being part of the till she works at, a mere extension of the items in the trolley. William Vollmann, who has researched poverty in its many geographical contexts, talks of 'invisibility' as an operative word in characterizing poverty.2 Poverty makes people invisible, and becomes itself invisible at the same time: those hit by poverty are neither seen nor noticed, and are ignored like beggars on a street. The German journalist Giinter Wallraff found out for himself what it was like to be homeless, living on the streets, and sometimes even locked up in a storage container (at times without windows).3 Florence Aubenas, who worked undercover as a low-paid cleaner for twelve months to find out what it is like to try to make a living, was told in an induction course that she should not expect anyone to pass the time of day with her as cleaner: this was something she would have to get used to.4 A cleaner is seen as an extension of the furniture (s)he is cleaning: you probably won't knock it over

or bump into it, but you won't need to say hello either. Such situations are all about attitude, an attitude which perceives others as things rather than beings.

It is exactly this attitude which the Israeli philosopher Avishai Margalit terms 'blindness to the human aspect' .5 The distinguishing feature of this blindness is not being able to see beyond or below the external, outer shell of others, and fails to notice the individual as individual. 'Blindness of the human aspect' implies restricted or diminished awareness in the process of noticing 'being' in 'other', but does not depend on depth of perception alone; it is a purely cognitive process of construction. In line with such an understanding of the term, 'blindness' is a clinical condition or dysfunctional vision comparable to colour blindness. Margalit points out that this type of blind- , ness suggests people look through others or ignore them as though they were not there, and is a key element of anti-colonial literature.6 There may be a fundamental difference in seeing others as 'things' or in just looking straight through them, but the perceptive refusal to see other as being and not thing is the same. Both aspects of seeing-failure to see-are intrinsic in patterns of awareness and not rationally justifiable cognitive interpretations. 'Blind,ness of human aspect' may fail to register one individual or, as is more common, disregard groups of individuals, for example for racist or sexist reasousperceiving these groups as outside the scope of what we might assess to be . human being.7 In other words, such blindness is caused by prejudice, which reduces individual *personae* to items on a shelf. It is an awareness engendering a frame of mind and type of action favoured by asymmetrical relationships. Those who run the greatest risk of falling victim to such a frame of mind are the socially vulnerable.

What becomes glaringly apparent in this everyday mode of conduct is that the root cause of treating others as mere things would seem to lie in the fact that we do not judge according to rational reasoning but according to the way we may see and perceive. In turn, this way of seeing is founded on particular patterns of experience which been corroborated artd endorsed again and again. Ludwig Wittgenstein voiced his views ou the condition of perception in his *Investigations,* asserting that we invariably: 'see something as something else'. 8 In being aware of what we see, certain features come to

the fore; only when other aspects are noticed-and considered, is our awareness of that which is seen modified.9 Such sentient awareness of aspects may suddenly flash before our eyes, 'half visual experience, half thought' .10 However, visual experience cannot be simply governed by cognitive powers of decision. All too often, we do not consciously register the shift in our awareness of what we see. 11 Perception and *interpretation--construction-are* not two disparate acts, categorized under separate headings. They are one and the same thing: share a oneness inextricably linked with our own private language and patterns of behaviour and those same patterns we see in others. Thus, our sense of perception and the language we use to describe it create a unity in as far as our own judgment of what we see relies on language to voice and create that judgment. *'Sprachspiele'* -judgments rendered, based on visual aspects-are intrenched in language and extra-language elements from which they cannot be divorced. 12 Both are part of a 'form of life' .13 Utterances-supposition expressed--on what we see before us, for example, referring to or describing colour, frequently border on the confines of logic and empiricism. 14 The complexity of terms and definitions of perception is no less vast than the phenomenon of form of *life-Lebensform-and* neither the one nor the other can be reduced by subjugating them to the disciplinary powers of rules. Any changes which occur must take place at a deeper level and infringe upon form of life.

For the purpose of our present discussion on human dignity, these considerations are threefold: firstly, the definition of the term human dignity will be examined via blindness of aspect as a genus of perception. Thus, the definition of human dignity as attendant on a specific disposition of awareness, or a particular way of seeing other as being, begs to be questioned. Secondly, perception, not irrelevant in our present discussion of the term human dignity, is embedded in a way of life and is dependent on precedent examples which nourish the attitude they foster. Thirdly, vulnerable individuals, rejected by soeialnorms, run a higher risk of not being noticed in blindness of aspect.

# Human dignity and interiority

What happens exactly when someone is perceived and treated like a thingan item off a supermarket shelf, an extension of the till, or simply a piece of furniture? What does it mean to see someone else as *someone* and not some*thing?* We assume a certain level of perception as our point of entry, which enables us to see other not only in physical externals but also the inner depth and nature beyond. In other words, the way we see a table differs considerably from how we perceive the depth and inner-being of other being. And it .is exactly this difference which enables us to humiliate and degrade others. You cannot humiliate a table: you may decide to use it for something other than the purpose it serves, you may damage or destroy it, but there is no way you can debase it. The whole notion of debasement by its very nature assumes a notion of vulnerability, which goes far and beyond external injury and damage and presupposes a meta-level of being, by which, in principle, we can reflect upon our attitude not only towards others but also of self. These two aspects are comprised in what we might term interiority. Humans are beings which can only be described via language, which similarly presumes that beyond the aspect of the visually obvious there is a complex world offeelings and emotions, powers of thought and reflection at work under the surface. Such assumptions are imperative if we are to define self-Jerold Seigel puts forward the idea that reflexivity is the defining principle in constructing the modern concept of self. 15

This perception of other as individual has become an integral part of our modern understanding of self. 'Inwardness' is the hallmark of modern identity, 16 put forward by Charles Taylor in his in-depth study of the modern selfY Taylor draws our attention to the fact that seeing other as self with all his/her innermost complexities inherent in 'ndividual identity is a typically modern concept. Likewise, it is this depth and complexity of self which denies scientific definition wholesale, because the subje<;:t of any scientific study has to be identified and described regardless of subjective interpretation, regardless of point of reference, and regardless of framework environment. None ofthis can be applied in analysing self in other and, does

to a certain degree elude any exhaustive examination of own self. 18 The feeling or notion of self must go beyond any neutral observation of being or categorization of the practicalities involved. Seeking to identify identity is an attempt to define a place from which I can make a statement, and which in turn I would like to be addressed. A key work in the historical development of understanding human interiority is Augustine's *Confessions.* 

While this key work undoubtedly had a decisive influence on the notion of inwardness, 19 one might dispute how original Augustine's ideas were. Augustine describes both himself and humankind in general as beings that have infinite inner-depth and rich resources at their disposal. The imagery Augustine uses to illustrate inwardness of being is revealing: the house (C I,5), the heart as vessel (C X,35), arable land (C 11,3), the image of the battleground (C VIII,8). While the image of the house, conveying the idea of untold rooms and space within, was outlined in the sixteenth century by Teresa of Avila in *The Interior Castle,* the image of a field to be ploughed suggests the labour and toil involved in attaining inwardness. The image of the battleground is perhaps the most dramatic, and reflects the battle being fought out within. This inner space of interiority is, according to Augustine, the 'core' of human being; it is that inner space in which we can find God and the place: 'where God makes himself known to me' (C I,2).20 This inner space is also the seat of that sense which perceives the voice of God, 'et clamasti de longinquo: ego sum qui sum. et audivi, sicut auditor in corde' (C VII,lO). This inner space is able to both hear and feel God; Augustine talks about: 'The ears of my heart' (C I,5). God is the true 'heart' of inward being, 'more inner than inner' (C III,6). This is how God knows us better than we can ever know ourselves, since fathoming the profundity of our own inwardness is beyond us. Inner-being resonates with the dynamics of our aspirations and desires, our past memories and the impact of decisions taken, the sense of joy and sense of despair. Thus, the soul as- inner space can be depicted as active agent as well as backdrop and set where the events of life are staged and come to pass. As immeasurable as our inner being may be, it is not without structure: it is the seat of diverse

Carey, *Augustine's Invention of the Inner* Self(Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2000). Carey reconstructs the Platonic school of thought as seen by Augustine in order to examine the originality of Augustine's ideas. Carey depicts the soul according to Plato's idea of Hell and Plotin's 'sphere revolving aronnd the inner source of intelligibility' -all metaphors of space with the inner palace as the key metaphor as used by Augustine whom he sees as a bridge between linking Plato and Descartes; compare with Michael Tkacz's review in *Journal of the History of Philosophy* 39:4 (2001 ), 584--5. 20 'Quis locus est in me, quoveniat in me deus meus? quo deus veniat in me, deus, qui fecit caelum et

powers (will, memory, reason) but also divergent moods and emotions (craving and lust, joy, fear, regret, and grief: C X,l4). Ofthese,Augustine reserves a special place for *memory-memoria-as* part of inner-being in his tenth book.21 Augustine maintains it is memory that drives the thinking process: thinking collects and orders random ideas (C X, II). He is continually amazed by that rich inner homogeneity of memory which harnesses the heterogeneity of thought. Memory plays a central role in Augustine's analysis of the heart of being and the core of interiority. In one place, he mentions having made the journey to the seat of the soul, 'which is in my own memory' ('intravi ad ipsius animi mei sedem (quae illi est in memoria mea, quoniam sui quoque meminit animus'; C X,25). Personal memory serves as meta-memory: 'I remember having remembered' (C X,13), and it is the place in which we are confronted by ourselves (C X,8).22 Finding rapport with self is perhaps *the*  cornerstone in a culture of interiority.

So saying, Augustine's *Confessions* present us with a rich tapestry of the wealth of inwardness which can bestow human life with depth and unique meaning.23 Inwardly, our abilities and powers are caught up in a fight for prominence; and it is here that decisions are arrived at and taken; a process involving striving, judgment, and memory. However, the governing factor in both decision-making and ensuing action remains the structure of innerbeing which can be moulded, fashioned, and shaped, and which is subject to inherent laws which can at the same time be specified. However, in any decision reached and any action taken, it is the structure and fabric of innerbeing, moulded, fashioned and shaped by experience and subject to inherent laws, which governs resources of inner-being as inexhaustible as they may be remain inaccessible without the grace of God; he knows our soul better than we do ourselves, and it is this-His-knowing which can lead us as beings to truth and salvation. This concept of understanding wili have an impact on the way we think about and regard ourselves; the way we think about self will also impact the way we define self-esteem or dignity. Seen in this light, self can be neither measured nor mapped, and remains an enigma to objective, scientific calculation. This would thus imply that the whole concept of

subjectivity has to be redefined too. An active agent bases his or her actions on emotions, ideas, aspirations, ambitions, and perception, which can only be accessed and expressed in the complex language found in interiority.

# Human dignity and vulnerability

In defining interiority, a new perspective in the understanding of vulnerability is also being created. Admission of human vulnerability has made a major contribution to ongoing discourse on human dignity, since its beginnings in the atrocities of the Second World War, and an attempt to eradicate an entire race of people.

I would now like to turn to the concept under discussion here-human dignity-and examine the association and correlation between the terms human dignity, interiority, and vulnerability, whereby the latter has little to do with the knowledge that 'something might happen'. It is more the 'capacity to be wounded';24 in other words, a profound realization that one's own integrity is at risk of being broken. Vulnerability is realizing the tentative nature and fragility of our own identity;25 it is an insight revealing that identity-that unique quality which makes us what we are-is something which can be injured, crushed or destroyed. Therefore, if that main characteristic of interiority, as set out above, is an integral part of what it is to be human and determines that universal image of human-being, then vulnerability is an essential aspect of humanness. Vulnerability lies in knowing that being human involves risks that cannot be reduced to zero, and that the human condition entails exposure to contingencies and stress. We may try to protect ourselves against the onslaughts risk might bring, and even though possible strategies in minimizing risk are disproportionate and reflect social standing, they are neither lasting nor perfect. We cannot take out insurance to prevent dementia, being involved in a car crash, or avoid natural catastrophes. Human dignity takes central stage when vulnerability overrides in a particular situation-a situation in which our concept of self is substantially challenged. Lisa Genova gives us a telling example in her novel *Still Alice,* in which the central figure, Alice, a fifty-year-old woman, is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. For a time, Alice defines herself in this situation of extreme vulnerability by disease, until she realizes that she is a human being beyond the confines of disease: wife,

mother, daughter, grandmother-to-be, best friend, cousin, and so on. Even under the most adverse conditions, a human being remains a human being, to be treated with a sense of depth. Defining human dignity lies at the heart of our being both prepared and willing to see other humans as beings.

The concept of human dignity is linked with the concept of vulnerability in at least two ways: first, because the concept of human dignity has emerged in confrontation with the fragility of human existence; second, because situations of experienced vulnerability prove to be the acid test of human dignity in its entirety. This connection between human dignity and vulnerability is important, since the definition of human dignity itself has to rise to at least three challenges: of its becoming pretentious, too far removed from the realities of everyday life, and/or so controversial as to be abused. These three aspects could push the whole debate surrounding human dignity over the edge of relevance, forcing it into a state of neither here nor there. Pretension tends to take over on those special occasions, where human dignity is celebrated and praised to the skies in ostentatious language. In a well-known text, Karl Popper warns about the use and power of 'big' words, which in covering up ambiguity in effect mislead.26 We stand in awe and allow ourselves to be browbeaten by big words; we are duped, and thus robbed of our faculties of objective reasoning. The concept of vulnerability can assist to keep the concept of human dignity on the ground, while it is operation;:tlized-by looking at elementary aspects of life. Human dignity becomes paramount when eating, drinking, egesting, sleeping, personal hygiene habits become especially vulnerable, for example, in hospitals, prisons, care-homes; places in which simple, personal patterns of day-to-day life become an issue-a problem. The status of elementary aspects of life serves as a litmus test for the concept of human dignity. The second challenge allows us to try out the 'trap of abstraction', which suggests that human dignity may well be assigned to each and every human being, but each and every human being is nevertheless treated in a different way: in this sense the equality of dignity is not visible.

This temptation of abstraction has been voiced by David Foster Wallace as an embodiment ofthe more dangerous side. of academic study, in that: 'it enables a tendency to over-intellectualize stuff, to get lost in abstract thinking, instead of simply paying attention to what's going on in front of me'. 27 Our definition of vulnerability will help us . in assessing the above, and if we remember that those who are particularly vulnerable in any society are

<sup>27</sup> D. F. Wallace, *This Is Water* (Cologne, Kiepenheuer & Witsch, 2012), 47.

those who are engaged in low-paid, unskilled work, in other words excluded from-outsiders of that society. And this begs the question of how people are treated and how are they shown respect particularly in adverse circumstances, for example within the confines-at every level-of a prison or psychiatric hospital. The acid test of self-esteem may then be found in considering how societies treat those who are vulnerable within that society. The third point could be described as cases of controversy, which is a favourite rhetorical device, implemented to stop conversations by using the concept of human dignity. Others adopt a more cynical approach to the topic of human dignity, regarding any terminology as utterly superfluous. There is a danger of becoming accustomed to a routine language of human dignity. The German historian Christian Meier reminds us that written accounts of history after Auschwitz will demand the ability of a 'constant renewal of shock' .28 Auschwitz must not be allowed to be become a routine norm. And the same could be said for the definition of human dignity: in appraising our own vulnerability, in understanding that self-esteem and respect of selflie at the heart of dignity, we adopt the attitude of a constant renewal of shock to avoid cynicism.

Thus, we might consider whether the definition of human dignity can be operationalized via our understanding of the term vulnerability. This would be additionally advantageous in that we could pinpoint concrete examples of how human dignity is approached and treated. In defining human dignity, we depend on examples which will impact and mould perception of its definition to guarantee its operationalization. Examples will always be found in those places where the vulnerable are hardest hit and the constant revisiting will adapt and adjust our perception. Jean Vanier discovered this for himself when in 1964 he gave up his academic career and set up a group home, the first of what would later become *L 'Arche.* In setting up his first shared community, he invited two people with severe developmental disabilities to share his home with him. He knew he was letting himself in for a life with people who were especially vulnerable and who in the social hierarchy of things were at the very bottom. He wanted to enable these individuals to discover their own sense of self-esteem. His whole understanding of being and self was to be transformed over the next few years in the experience of day-to-day living with two very vulnerable individuals. He found out that encountering vulnerable people may be healing: 'If you enter into relationship with a lonely or suffering person you will discover something else: that it is you who are being healed. The broken person will reveal to you your own hurt and the hardness

<sup>28</sup> C. Meier, *Von Athen bis Auschwitz* (Frankfurt am Main, Fischer, 2002), chapter 5.

of your heart, but also how much you are loved.' 29 Vanier realized that in discovering his own vulnerability and in recognizing the mystery of each person he was moving towards an understanding of human dignity.

Vanier is moved by a firm belief in the mission and mystery of each person: 'There is a meaning to every life, even if we cannot see it. I believe that each person, in her unique beauty and worth, lives out a sacred story. ' 30 Vanier sees each person with a particular 'secret and mystery', a particular journey, a particular vocation to grow. The deepest identity that we can discover is a sense of our own worthY This worth is not to be realized *in spite* of our vulnerability but because of it. It is through our vulnerability that we can overcome roles and masks, and face ourselves and our mystery. If we deny our weaknesses and vulnerability, we deny a part of who we are. In recognizing our vulnerability, we discover our fundamental unity, our common humanity. The recognition of the vulnerability and the mystery of a person lead to the basis of what we share as humans, which is also the basis for important elements of human dignity based on a sense of that mystery and sense of vulnerability. If we treat human beings like objects, we fail to do justice to the fundamental dimensions of what it is to be human. Vanier speaks from his own experience: 'People with disabilities who have been rejected or abandoned rise up with new energy and creativity when they feel loved and respected ... The presence of someone who loves them reveals to them their value and importance. ' 32 It is against this background that we can understand Desmond Tutu's famous insight that perpetrators by humiliating others also lose the sense of their own dignity.

In realizing his own vulnerability, Vanier gained deeper insight into his sense of dignity. Let us call this realization 'the wound of knowing' ,by which I mean the painful knowledge that individual identity is fragile: it is knowing that our identity is transient, and knowing that at any time we may find ourselves in a situation in which we are dependent on and in need of another or others; it may be a sudden stroke or unforeseen accident which makes this realization a revelation. Such knowledge implies a sense of humility, which in tum will foster organic solidarity, recognizing that we are all vulnerable. The main point here lies in the insight that the wound of knowing will not

undermine but strengthen the definition of human dignity even under the most adverse conditions: therein lies the ultimate test.

### Poverty, self-respect, and human dignity

A definition of human dignity is both necessary yet jeopardized at the same time: exactly where 'blindness to the human aspect' prevails. Blindness of others is a pattern of perception which sees 'human' as a thing with no inner depth. Recognizing inner depth is the admission of the existence of vulnerability in some form or other: the definition of vulnerability can be operationalized via the defining terms of human dignity-the most stringent test of all. How are people treated when their vulnerability is increased? As we have already seen, the risk of such blindness is higher and is, indeed, more pronounced in asymmetrical relationships. Thus, the concept of human dignity becomes a 'concept of crisis' that can be brought to the discourse by way of a preferential option for dealing with vulnerable people.

Susceptibility to poverty is one such social condition in which vulnerability is acutely experienced. Many stories have been told and written about the hardships of poverty; one story might be about poverty as experienced when there is no income, no bread-winner, describing poverty in monetary terms. This objectified approach to poverty can be measured and administered by the welfare state. A second story might depict poverty as social exclusion, the exclusion from standardized cultural activities. This approach describes poverty as a relative, complex and non-static condition. A third story might characterize poverty as having robbed or deprived a person of abilities and skills; poverty in this approach can be reconstructed as a lack of genuine opportunities.33 All these stories have one thing in common-they touch upon and care about identity of self: human identity. Poverty can deprive a person of their resources of identity, which will include recognition and appreciation, a sense of belonging, or robust concern; access to which will be that much more difficult in a life of poverty. Poverty as social exclusion will prevent access to identity-forming groups, undermining a sense of belonging; an existence hallmarked by poverty will be entrenched in acute shortages and insufficiency, which will exacerbate any chance of taking on responsibility, of making promises, and of entering commitments-thus undermining the possibility of robust concern as a resource of identity.

<sup>33</sup> Compare with Amartya. Sen, *Development as Freedom* (New York, Basic Books, 1999), chapter 4.

#### 570 *Clemens Sedmak*

One moving and explicit example of the dynamics and ensuing erosion involved in resources of identity is that in *Boyhood,* the autobiography of the South African Nobel Prize winner J. M. Coetzee. He tells ofhis father, who loses his job and means of making a living as a lawyer. Even without employment, his father goes into town every day but comes back one or two hours later, then spends the rest of the day in bed doing the crossword puzzle in local paper and drinking a bottle of brandy. Not only does the father withdraw from the family within the home, he also becomes an alcoholic, and hides any bills delivered by the postman. Soon the whole situation has escalated out of control, and the family loses almost everything they have. The son loses his sense of respect for his own father, and refers to him simply as 'this man'. The father in turn loses all sense of belonging and the respect of his family (his own son denies him participating in family affairs-refuses him membership), and loses all sense of responsibility and attendant structures it requires (he becomes increasingly listless and lethargic-he no longer cares about anything). The consequences are a sense of shame and humiliation.

The knock-on effect incumbent on losing one's job-as in similar situations of social exclusion-is increased vulnerability. Poverty, in depriving one of one's own resources of identity, jeopardizes the highest moral value there is: self-respect-which is basically the individual equivalent of the social definition of human dignity. In attributing dignity to a human being, the foundation stone of a reflexive relationship with self has been both granted and created. Self-respect is regard and esteem of self inherent in one's own being. Blindness-as outlined above--erodes another's sense of dignity as source of self-respect. These dynamics need to be incorporated in any discourse on human dignity for two reasons: first, it is only by granting socio-economic rights that a way of life anchored in human rights within a given community even under adverse conditions can be guaranteed; a society as experienced by Desmond Tutu will eat away at an individual sense of human dignity if allowed to push-force-individuals and groups of individuals into inhuman living conditions. Second, it is in exactly such inhuman living conditions that one has to ensure that those hit by abject poverty do not lose or are not denied resources of self-identity as a source of self-respect. One major source-and resource-of understanding the human condition in poverty is interiority, similar to the protagonist in Lisa Genova's novel-who can see herself with respect if she is treated with respect. The same applies to a poor person: s/he is first and foremos a living being and before and beyond 'being' poor. The dynamics of everyday economics underlie '(re-)structuring identity'. Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo discovered the idea of access to good life rather than rational survival strategies in their study on poverty: 'When very poor

people get a chance to spend a little bit more on food, they don't put everything into getting more calories. Instead, they buy better-tasting, *more expensive* calories. ' 34 A concrete example:

> We asked Oucha Mbarbk, a man whom we met in a remote village in Morocco, what he would do if he had more money. He said he would buy more food ... We were starting to feel very bad for him and his family, when we noticed a television, a parabolic antenna, and a DVD player in the room where we were sitting. We asked him why he had bought all these things if he felt the family did not have enough to eat. He laughed, and said, 'Oh, but television is more important than food! ' 35

This statement reflects the idea of self-respect. Decisions made in how we spend money can be key decisions taken in how we see and interpret self and identity, since the things we buy are the things that help make us what we are-give us the identity we have. Goods that we buy, things that we own say a lot about our identity, as has been shown by the British anthropologist Daniel Miller in a study of street-life in London.36 Goods help us to express our identity.

When people do not have to give up or forgo that deep inward sense of their own being even under the most gruelling conditions, they have a chance of coming out on the other side-surviving. The example of Ingrid Betancourt, held hostage for over six years in the Colombian jungle, illustrates just this. She explicitly and consciously held onto the concept of her own dignity to remain resilient under these conditions of extreme vulnerability.37 Human dignity is not an extravagant issue reserved only for academic discourse but a mamstay of survival-falling victim to the trap of vulnerability or not and preventing other and selfbecoming blind to that being and self in other.
