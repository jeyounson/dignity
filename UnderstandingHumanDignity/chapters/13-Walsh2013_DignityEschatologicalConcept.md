# **Dignity as an Eschatological Concept**

#### *David Walsh*

AN ESCHATOLOGICAL coNCEPT rs one that cannot be fully known because we live within it. One day its meaning will be disclosed, but for now we see through a glass darkly. Human dignity is such a concept because it says what we cannot fully say: that is, that each human being is inviolable. There is a zone of inviolability we must not cross because it would be to deny the very meaning of what it is to be a person. As one who holds his or her existence in his or her own hands, we must not take that away by treating them as objects of control. Autonomy is too thin a word for what autonomy identifies. It is the whole metaphysical significance of the person that is at issue when we confront the question of human dignity. Our difficulty is that we live in a world without metaphysics, and therefore have to say what cannot be said. 1 This chapter takes up the challenge by pointing to eschatology as the horizon of saying because it is the horizon of our existence. We begin by reflecting on what it means to live within an understanding we do not fully penetrate, and thereby enlarge the possibility of truth. Then we examine the regime of rights that is our authoritative moral language, yet one that acknowledges its own incompleteness. When pressed to explain what rights are imputed to defend, our 'rights-talk' can only point to the dignity of the person. This is why the topic

1 George Kateb takes up a similar challenge in his essay on *Human Dignity* by insisting that we must be able to ground the conviction in wholly secular terms. The project is admirable but its completion would require a more expansive language than seems to be available, although he does approach it in invoking Emerson's characterization of every person as an 'infinitude'. The difficulty is that he immediately dismisses the notion of immortality as a subjective longing for endless life, rather than a glimpse of the true infinite that exceeds the mere extension of temporality. But is not that glimpse itself the proof of immortality? Kateb can, in other words, account for everything but his own convictions. 'We need to stay true to what we know-the immensity beyond immensity of space and time and the universe's purposeless waste--because that knowledge is an incomparably superior encouragement to wonder.' In light of that true immortality we disdain the false immortality of mere endless life. *Human Dignity* (Cambridge, MA, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2011), 125,215. As with so many 'secular' accounts, Kateb's explains everything except the source of his own perspective. Only infinity can apprehend the finite.

of human dignity has in the last few decades surfaced with new prominence. The problem, third, is that dignity proves more elusive than its invocation might suggest because it protects what is most invisible of all. That is, the true self that even the person him- or herself never fully apprehends. In avoiding metaphysics we have evoked it even more deeply. We cannot finally deny, fourth, that dignity derives from the transcendence of the person by which each of us approaches the transcendence of God. Human dignity names our capacity to go beyond the claim to dignity through total self-emptying. It is thus what constitutes the transcendence of the person and can therefore never really be lost. That is why, most of all, it must be preserved, as the framework of rights has continually sought to do.

# Primacy of the practical

We begin by noting that the notion of dignity has migrated from a social setting where the assertion of status was all important to one in which it is precisely the capacity to transcend any status claim that is the central issue. Rather than a world immanent concept, dignity has become an eschatological proclamation. Each one of us exceeds the whole world, because we are called to exceed all limits in self-giving. There is no worldly limit to our capacity to love. It is that eschatological flash that we glimpse when we glimpse the reality of the person, or rather, the non-reality of the person who transcends every boundary assigned in advance. The inexhaustibility of the person, the inwardness within which everything is contained, is familiarly intuited in the persons we know. We might say that we hardly know them until we encounter them as individual abysses of unknowability. This is why we cannot know persons except personally. Then we at least gain a sense of each person's unique unfathomability. The problem is that we have no philosophical language that can access that mutuality of persons that is more than words can say. Even worse, philosophy has often despaired of the task. It concedes the death of metaphysics, the opaqueness of the language of substance as well as the language of God, and betrays a singular lack of interest even in attempting to say what cannot be said about itself. Wittgenstein is one of the few exceptions, at least in calling attention to the problem. 2 But this is where

<sup>2</sup> This is the famous observation with which he opens and closes the *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*  by insisting that 'what we cannot talk about we must pass over in silence'. Unfortunately most of his readers fail to notice that this non-saying is in effect a saying. Certainly he has not passed over in silence.

politics enters the scene. In the political realm, philosophical limits cannot define the human limits. We cannot await the theoretical breakthroughs that would prove sufficiently compelling, but must forge a meaning from the remnants that still retain the evocative moral authority that wins our consent. In politics we do not agree on foundations and then erect the principles by which a publicly representative order is affirmed. Theoretical comprehension arises, like the owl of Minerva, only late in the day, and even then does not entirely detach itself from the principles whose emergence has been the condition of its own possibility. Before we reflect on whence we have come and who we are, as well as whither we are going, we are already bound by certain moral and political convictions with which we cannot dispense. Truthfulness cannot be grounded unless we are already prepared to do so truthfully. Loyalty cannot be discussed unless we are already pledged to its indefeasibility. This is why politics is always in advance of its philosophy and the prayer life of the Church is prior to its theology. What theoretical reflection provides is not the first principles of what it examines but a meditation on what it finds as already obliging its own exercise. Philosophy can never contain that wherein it too is contained. It is bound by the primacy of the practical that receives its public authorization only within politics.

A case in point is the unsurpassability of human rights. The mutual recognition of rights is not only entailed within the logic of discourse in general, as Jiirgen Habermas suggests, but it is even more deeply entailed within the moral imperative of the human community. 3 It is difficult, if not impossible, for us to conceive of a human community that would not value each and every member as unique, irreplaceable, and immeasurable. Of course, we know of societies that devalue and dehumanize their members, but we cannot regard them as anything but perverse. What is decisive, however, is that we cannot conceive of any higher notion of community than the one that puts the neediest member first, that is, the one whose rights are in any instant most in need of defending. This does not mean that every member is preoccupied with the protection and the assertion of their individual rights. On the contrary, the reciprocity that a regime of rights requires consists in the mutual self-restraint by which the rights of all are recognized. Rights are permissive; they are not unlimited claims. We are free to exercise them or not, but we are free to abrogate them in others. It may indeed be that in defending my rights l defend the rights of all, and that when the rights of one are threatened the rights of all are placed in jeopardy, but this is not a prescription for collective self-interest.

Our interests are served only within a regime founded on fairness, because it is only then that the right to what each is owed is sufficiently guaranteed. Interest is served only when justice takes precedence. A system of rights is the way in which this relationship gains recognition. Its discovery, however, . has largely been the fruit of historical practice for which the theoretical justification has continued to lag.4 The pattern is detailed in Brian Tierney's *The Idea of Natural Right,* which traces the rise of natural rights largely outside medieval political theory to show that rights can be invoked within any expansive legal framework. 5 The canonists distinguished between the ownership of property and its use, and thereby established the notion of a right from which others could be excluded. It was only a small step for William of Ockham to establish the idea of a right that could not be alienated in his dispute with Pope John XXII over Franciscan poverty. The most that the vow of poverty could entail is a renunciation of the legal right to property, since the natural right to the use of property for life could never be renounced. From there, the idea migrated to the conciliarist disputes in which the right of the Church, and of any community, to govern itself could not be renounced. This in turn created difficulty for the Spanish monarchy in the sixteenth century, when Vitoria and the Spanish scholastics insisted that conquest of the Americas had not abrogated the natural rights of the Indians to property and self-government. In other words, long before political theory had begun its quest for the foundations of rights, the discourse had emerged in practical disputes in which inalienability had become starkly visible.

# Dignity as the invisible source of rights

To call these 'subjective rights', as even Tierney does, is to suggest that they have no other basis than the mere assertion of claims. But they are not subjective in this relativist sense. Rather, they are simply the result of adopting the

<sup>4</sup> The prioritization of practice over theory, as well as the characterization of political principles as abbreviations, has long been assqciated with the thought of Michael Oakeshott, especially in *Rationalism and Politics* (Indianapolis, Liberty Fund, rev. ed., 1991 ). It is doubtful, however, that Oakeshott would have applied his notion to the language of rights, although, I would argue, that a more thorough application of the primacy of practice would have required it. His closest approach is in the notion of a 'civil association', which he distinguishes sharply from an 'el).terprise-association' in *On Human Conduct* (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1975).

*<sup>5</sup>* Brian Tierney, *The Idea of Natural Rights* (Atlanta, Scholars Press, 1997), provides the historical account, but we can also see Rawls's principle that 'the right is prior to the good' as its philosophical counterpart.

perspective of the person affected, the individual subject whose humanity is under threat. In effect, they are objective rights, the ineradicable rights that attach to a human being simply in virtue of his or her humanity without subtraction or addition. When all else is lost or renounced, they are the rights that remain to denote the inexhaustible reality of the person. The problem is that the source of that inexhaustibility remains strangely invisible. We are hard pressed to locate what cannot be located or to measure what cannot be measured. It is only in the heightened vitality of the disputes, in which the notion of natural rights arises, that their imprescriptible reality is clearly glimpsed. Once the high drama of defence has passed, rights recede into the inaccessible. It is no wonder that they generate a rich trail of theoretical adumbrations even if none have succeeded in establishing their formulations definitively. More recently, that awareness of intellectual fragility has begun to surface within the practical realm in which the priority of rights must be implemented. It is no accident that the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights simultaneously avoids any indication of the source of justification of rights while also invoking the substantive notion of human dignity as their background. The same pattern is repeated in other contemporary constitutions, notably the German and Israeli ones, in which the protection of rights is deemed to be insufficient protection for what must be protected. Over the past twenty-five years the theme of dignity has become pervasive in charters and courts as they concede the insufficiency of a rights jurisprudence. Dignity is required to name what must be preserved over and above the preservation of rights. Only if it is named can the source of rights be adequately guarded.

The difficulties that this movement beyond the specificity of rights generates are readily accepted as the price that must be paid for what is priceless.6 It is an impressive testament to deeper resonances within liberal discourse. Where philosophy has failed and religion has been unable to generalize its insights,the law must invoke what cannot readily be invoked. Dignity is surely the most elusive concept of all. Its presence within legal briefs and judicial opinions signals a felt need that is otherwise utterly unmet within the public square. Somehow the harm that the deprivation of rights inflicts must be ed not just in the name of what is right but in relation to what the right seeks to shield. That evolution was amply displayed in the thought oflmmanuel Kant, who was the one who introduced the notion of universal human dignity, in contrast to prior conceptions of dignity as specific to a particular office or station in life. Where previously dignity was precisely what attached to the role a

person played in society, now it would arise from the person who stood apart from the multiplicity of roles in which he or she might appear. Rather than the dignity of what is visible, Kant would turn our attention towards the dignity that exceeds all visibility. Kant may not be thinking juristically, but the same . inexorability is at work in both cases. When we think about the respect that is owed to each human being, we realize that it cannot be limited to the finite contribution each has made. When they are no longer marked by their role, we are required even more to respect the person who played it. Entitlement to dignity is by virtue of his or her humanity. The sharp distinction we had made between social status and human status begins to melt away as we realize that the latter is the ground of the former. There are no pure role-players.7 All are persons who first possess the dignity of persons.

It is their integrity as persons, their inwardness, that the notion of dignity seeks to guard. Rights are merely the external defences against the infringement of what is, strictly speaking, internal. This is, of course, what makes the protection of dignity so notoriously difficult, because what may be an infringement to one may not be so to another. Dignity is not contained in any of the codifiable attributes that make a legal code possible. What may be a:n insupportable burden to one may be a matter of indifference to another. A prohibition against turbans falls more heavily on Sikh men than on the rest of the gender, just as a ban on headscarves affects Muslim women differently from other women. In each case, it is not the specific character of the burden that is at issue but the way in which it infringes upon the inner freedom of the person to be him- or herself. Without intending it, requirements that on the face of it may be trivial or neutral can have the effect of abrogating the most sacrosanct imperative of self-determination. Of course, each individual.remains capable of an interior refusal to obey, but this cannot be manifested within the external world. They are deprived of the possibility of presenting themselves in public, which is more than the loss of what they would present. It is a denial of the self as the source of all self-presentation. To denigrate or diminish that innermost self, the self from whiCh all self-expression arises while it itself remains beyond expression, is to strike at the core of the person. It is to deny the dignity of that which enacts its own being. This is the awesome stature of the person for whom no one is entitled to but the person him- or herself. The person denied does not disappear but is prevented from appearing. It is the

<sup>7</sup> This is an insight that has remained latent from the beginning in the Greek word *prosopon,* from which our word 'person' is derived. Originally it meant the mask that the actor wore, so it already called attention to the invisible one who was always there behind the mask, but could not be presented as such. We have Y.et to develop a philosophical account of the person that is adequate to this paradoxical reality. A forthcoming work, *Politics of the Person,* is aimed at meeting this challenge in part.

objectification of what cannot and should not be objectified. But what of the possibility that the person might choose that path of diminished personhood?

### Dignity as invisible

This was the great difficulty that Kant intuited and struggled against. Indeed, his whole discourse about human dignity can be read as a protracted effort to heighten the awareness of dignity as a bulwark against its deliberate devaluation. 8 Even when we must allow ourselves to be used as objects, as in his strangely objectivist conception of marriage, we must take steps to ensure that the person is not reduced to that status. Marriage is the only way that the sexual relationship of men and women can affirm that they are more than what they do.9 In marriage the partners are received as wholes and never as parts. The person who presents him- or herself to the other is acknowledged as what can never be fully presented. That is what is absent from the contract of prostitution. Even the term carries disavowal within it, for in that case the partners have only presented themselves in the form of economic exchange. Any service that entails the whole person cannot be reduced to the coin of barter. Persons can engage in economic exchanges precisely because they cannot exchange themselves. An economy requires persons who stand outside it as enactors of the freedom that makes it all possible. The person who remains beyond every action can neither be subsumed into the transaction nor excluded from it. Dignity is the path by which what cannot be said, what can neither be preserved nor abolished, is irrefutably displayed. Autonomy, Kant discovered, cannot be exercised in disregard of its own meaning. What remains to be discovered is how self-determination is bounded by what makes it possible.

In the absence of any comprehensive philosophical defence of the dignity of the person, we must be particularly alert to the insights that are generated in the field of practice. Real life controversies, especially as are encountered in courts of law, are an invaluable guide, for they arise not only from the law but also from the most elementary human responses. What cannot be

<sup>8</sup> Something similar may be said about the heroic resistance against the devaluation of liberty undertaken by Tocqueville in the name ofliberty. 'It is easy to see that what is lacking in such nations (who have chosen a comfortable slavery] is a genuine love of freedom, that lofty aspiration which (I confess) defies analysis. For it is something one must *feel* and logic has no part in it. It is a privilege of noble minds which God has fitted to receive it, and it inspires them with a generous fervour. But to meaner souls, untouched by the sacred flame, it may well seem incomprehensible.' *The Old Regime and the French Revolution,* trans. Stuart Gilbert (Garden City, NY, Doubleday, 1955), 169.

concealed or denied is very often what makes its way into raw judicial decisions. One thinks of the famous dwarf-tossing case in which no amount of protest ofliberty interests could override the sense that here a human had been utterly reduced to an object. 10 Could the assimilation to a piece of inert mat-. ter have gone any further? Perhaps only mutilation or the sale of body parts could suggest a further disdain and, characteristically, have also prompted a similar revulsion. At such points, all that is interior to a person seems to have been drained away. These are practices we would have difficulty contemplating even in relation to a corpse, so that it is inconceivable that they should be perpetrated on one who is alive. It is the loss of the person with whom one can relate that is the most devastating. Like torture or degradation, we can only engage in such practices when we have been able to cast aside any suggestion that this other is an other, another human being. 11 Even killing can often retain more of a sense of the nobility of the other as a worthy opponent who must not be gratuitously or inhumanly mistreated. Crimes against humanity that 'shock the conscience' are terms arising from such historical moments of revulsion, and, like many things said in the heat of emotion, they do not necessarily accurately reflect their own genealogy. The formulations suffer from an excessive abstraction, as if humanity could be assaulted or conscience shocked in general. The truth is that it is only individual human beings that can be killed, and we can be revolted only by the destruction of each unspeakably precious life. This is why the aggregate number of exterminations and casualties numb the imagination. We can be stirred to indignation only when we behold the misery of a single one. What is true of one is true of all, that each one carries a whole interior world within, and that it is the denial ofthat that is the ultimate indignity. Their suffering has ceased to count. Thus, it is not that they suffered but that they are no longer regarded as persons. The ultimate indignity points us towards what dignity is intended to guard.

Such a route is needed because dignity names what is invisible. The person is the source of all that is visible about the person but remains therefore beyond visibility. We often resort to the notion of a 'transcendent core' of the person to suggest what it is that dignity seeks to protect, but that language has understandably lost its evocative power. This is not necessarily to be regretted because the term is a contradiction. A core indicates an irreducible bedrock, while transcendent suggests that it lies beyond all fixity. Besides, we have

become accustomed to conceiving of the philosophical alternatives as either deontological or consequential, both alternatives that eschew any appeal to ontology. What we have not considered is that the dignity of the person may not need any grounding in terms of ontological status. Just as the person lies beyond any social status, and thus can be regarded in relation to their human dignity quite apart from the dignity of their particular office or role, so the person can be seen as standing outside all ontological status, as incapable of containment within any horizon to which they may be assigned. Indeed, persons can consider their ontological status precisely because they are not simply confined to it. Dignity can be gained or lost because we are beyond dignity as such. We have already seen that the person is what eludes all the enactments and expressions to which he or she gives rise. There would be no 'giving rise' if there was not first what is not given rise to. Now we must be prepared to take the next step to which we have been led. We must dispense with the metaphysical crutch that there is nevertheless some innermost core, some primordial stuff, from which the person emerges and on which he or she is grounded. The extraordinary thing about persons is that they hold their existence in their own hands. They can give themselves or they can withhold themselves, so that nothing else can bear responsibility for them. Even God is not responsible for them, for he has left them free. Nothing is prior to the person who thus shares in the primordiality of God. In other words, the status of the person is of that which is beyond all status. Whatever is adduced as the ground of the value of the person, even the love of God, remains available to the person to be accepted or rejected. The demise of ontology (itself a hybrid invention) is therefore not to be lamented, for it always stood in the way of glimpsing that which it sought to articulate. Metaphysics (another surrogate) must finally yield to eschatology as we admit that the person arises from what is not, as befits the proper meaning of what is transcendent.

Persons transcend all saying and doing

Perhaps it is time too to shed the connection that the term human dignity has with any notion of status. Granted that it has already eliminated the vestiges of special status in favour of a universalization of simply human status from which no one is excluded. But this still may suggest something too worldly. It leaves something tangible, even if it is universally human, on which the person may stake his or her dignity. In doing so, however, we betray the dignity of the person which does not tum on any particular features or qualities the person may possess. Even the dignity of a rational being, so important to

#### 254 *David Walsh*

Kant, seems to suggest that it must be accorded only so long as we retain the capacity to reason. This is, of course, the error into which the inclination to define what it means to be a person, and therefore an agent of dignity, inevitably leads. It is not what we intend in invoking the term human dignity, for we mean precisely the opposite of any scale of measurement. Even those who fall short of displaying their full personhood are somehow persons, and we affirm this in according them the dignity of persons. We do not ask them to produce proof of personhood. Instead, we are inclined to conclude that they most of all are persons, for they allow us to relate directly to them in all their invisibility. By saying nothing they have said everything. They show that above all persons are, most of all when they are not expressed in anything present. Even without consciousness, they give themselves through their breathing until they yield up their last breath. Theirs is the dignity of having given all, and we realize that there is nothing in which they can be contained. This is why we reverence their remains as what still speak to us even after the person is gone. Not even death can defeat the person who, somehow, is deathless. This is why the distinctive mark of all human societies is remembrance of the dead. We are inclined to think that thinking about the afterlife is the result of religion, but it is really the converse. Religion arises because we already know about the afterlife through our experience as persons who are never fully here and therefore are never fully departed.

To be a person is to be transcendent. We therefore know about the transcendent, God, only because we participate in that mode of being. Whatever we have said or done we have gone beyond it as that which can never be identical with the said or done. Persons thus exist nowhere. It is futile to ask for a metaphysics of the person, as if anything more substantive could explain the transcendence of the person. We can understand metaphysics, the possibility of transcendence, because we are persons capable of containing the whole world inwardly only because we are not present within it. This is the *imago Dei,* although the formula already suffers from the defect of suggesting that there is a likeness for what has no likeness. But the term also works because it shows that we have been able to glimpse the transcendent by virtue of our own transcendence. God can be known only by persons who are Godlike. That is their dignity. They are beyond any claim to dignity in this world. It is the dignity of those whose dignity does not turn on any display of dignity. They hold their dignity within their own hands and can freely take it up or surrender it. For this reason it does not arise from our acknowledgement. They cannot lose it, although we may fail to acknowledge its imperative. The dignity of persons is that they are deathless, that they stand outside all that they are. They cannot lose what never is. This is why, no matter what indignity they may suffer, they can never lose their dignity. Of course a human being may lose control, may be overwhelmed by suffering and devastation, but that is only a possibility for one who is not defined by that extremity of misery. Only persons can suffer because they are not identical with pain. Animals are engulfed in their pain. This is why we put them out of their pain. We cannot do that for a human being who always remains beyond the pain he or she undergoes. This is why they have faith, a faith by which their suffering is transcendence. 12

It is exemplified by Christ, who not only lays aside the dignity of God to become man but even sets aside the prerogatives of a human being through his death on the cross. It is a death utterly without dignity because it is public. Crucifixion is certainly among the most excruciating ways to die, but it is intensified when it is undergone before a hostile public gaze. 13 The innermost agony of the person is exposed. That moment when the person is at his most vulnerable, the precious loss of life that must be shielded from the stare of indifferent onlookers, has been ripped open. What should be observed only by those who can share in the suffering of the dying is exhibited for all to see. Not only is death inflicted but the person is annihilated as a person. The interior life is denied, for it is objectified. Like one of Francis Bacon's carcass paintings, everything says this was not a human being. Of course that is precisely Bacon's point, that we cannot look upon a human being in that way. Yet that is the way willingly undergone by Jesus. He not only suffered and died, but did so in such a way that he abandoned all human dignity. Yet he simultaneously regained all that had been lost. In giving himself up, shedding not only the last drop of blood but also the last vestige of human dignity, Christ showed the real character of human dignity. It is the dignity of yielding up one's dignity completely. It is the dignity of God that carries nothing of self-concern within it but freely gives itself on behalf of all. No greater triumph over evil is possible than the divine action in which God sacrifices himself completely. Nor is there any, greater meaning to human dignity than the capacity to· share in that total outpouring that is the life of God. This is why human dignity is an eschatological concept. It cannot be described in the terminology ofthis world for it has exceeded every finite measurement. It is the dignity of the immeasurable, the dignity of that which has renounced all claims to dignity. That is its dignity. It is the dignity of what is beyond dignity.

#### 256 *David Walsh*

This does not of course mean that it is only in the renunciation of dignity that dignity is realized. An even worse implication would be to suggest that dignity must not be safeguarded because it cannot ultimately be lost. The highest aspiration of our humanity would be taken as an invitation for its worst desecration. What could be worse than the blatant disregard of the best? Generosity is not an invitation to robbery. It may indeed be, as Plato saw, that the evildoers are even more severely injured than those whom they injure, but we cannot countenance their actions without complicity in them. Dignity, the dignity that cannot be lost, must be saved most of all. The challenge is to find a means of saving it when it appears to have no worldly presence at all. Dignity may be eschatological, but it is not for that reason any the less real or any the less present. We encounter it in every person towards whom we are charged with protecting their inviolability. Their self-presentation must be sacrosanct. No one can subsume the innermost self from whom all their existence flows. To do so would be to abrogate their existence as persons, that is as beings who have no existence but what they put themselves into. Their interiority must be guarded as the highest, uncontainable in anything but itself. But this means that we must be hesitant in imposing our judgement of what dignity requires in place of the person's own. We can easily see that there are many situations that might be deemed undignified or even degrading to outsiders but not to the responsible individuals themselves. Human dignity cannot be so serious that it prohibits all undignified behaviour-a bar that would eliminate many of the activities in which we engage. Nor can dignity lack the highest seriousness of the capacity to surrender all claims to dignity, to exercise dignity in its most transcendent form. The turning point in each of these cases is to judge the validity of the claim to be exercising the highest form of self-responsibility.

The eschatological moment in which the whole of a person's existence is contained is neither private nor solitary. It is the meeting place of all human beings past, present, and future under the gaze of irremovable judgement. All have become judges who niust place themselves in the position of the other. We cannot avoid rendering a judgement on the judgement that the person him- or herself must render. Have I·put myself wholly into this action? Ifl have, then there is nothing that can diminish the dignity invested. Even letting oneself be demeaned to the level of an inanimate object can be accepted so long as it is a full expression of the self. But that does not mean that we must support every degradation to which a person may volunteer. It is only those losses to which a person has wholly submitted that can be regarded as retaining the dignity of a human being. The whole person must be given in the action. That is not possible if the indignity is merely an economic transaction,

for no one can give him- or herself for the sake of an object. One can only give oneself for the sake of a person, including one's own person. Then one is giving what cannot be given and yet must be given in a human relationship. In an economic exchange at most we can give our time, ourselves in part. Material transactions are somehow beneath the dignity of persons who reside forever outside them. It is only if the meaning of an action rises above the economic level that it is an appropriate communication of the person as such. This is why it is possible to sacrifice oneself for another but it is impossible to sell oneself to another. Paradoxical as it may be, one can give away what cannot be sold. That which is priceless cannot be bought. Anything into which the person places the whole self, that is, precisely what cannot be contained in anything finite, must not be reduced to the terms of conveyance. The person always communicates by going beyond all that is said. By contrast, an exchange is what can be reduced to the terms of a contract. Marriage is virtually an overturning of its contract because it is unconditional. Organ donation is bedevilled by the same impossibility of reducing it to an economy. It may indeed be the case that everyone else in an operation gets paid but the donor, but has not the donor demonstrated that he or she has given more than can be repaid, in giving life? The dignity of the immeasurable cannot be measured.

### Rights as guarding the invisible

The person who exceeds all that is given must nevertheless be preserved in his or her excessiveness. Has the giving been in the name of what cannot be given or only in the guise of what can be given and which is thus not given at all? It is in that eschatological arc that the dignity of the person lies. Is the uncontainable self contained in the action? That is the only relevant question, for we cannot prejudge in advance what form the gift of self may assume. This is why it is difficult to judge an affront to dignity, although it is not by any means impossible. We know what the gift is when we receive it. All we have to do is oppose its being counterfeited. This may still not forestall the possibility that counterfeit can be employed as the only available medium of truth. Humiliation may be redeemed by the giving that transfigures it or by the laughter that detonates it. We cannot fix the criteria of authenticity in advance of the event, but we can insist on its applicability. In doing so, we have established a boundary of dignity that, while it may be breached, has nevertheless marked what must be defended. Dignity, in the end, recedes into the indefinable, but that is why it must nevertheless be defined. We cannot protect the dignity that includes the possibility of its own self-abandonment as its highest possibility, but it is just for that reason that we must make the attempt. Law must define the indefinable in the only way that it can. It must acknowledge that law itself is overtaken by the dignity of the self that exceeds its own dignity. The legislation of dignity cannot in the final analysis escape the eschatological character of its subject. Law too must exceed its own limits.

It must acknowledge that human dignity cannot be alienated even when it is legally alienated. This is the core of the famous dispute of the Franciscans with Pope John XXII, when it was precisely their determination to renounce all that brought inalienability into focus. They could only alienate a legal right to property but never the inalienable right to the means necessary for life. Law encounters the limits of law in the notion of natural rights. They are not subject to the conveyance of law. Dignity as the unfathomable depth of the person, the container of the interior presentation of self, is the flash of transcendence that is glimpsed in the prohibitions against the violation of human rights. What is not present anywhere may nevertheless be intuited in the barriers it provokes. The discovery of natural and human rights is just such a moment. It is the point at which the law acknowledges its insufficiency as law. That is, that it is itself measured by an order of right beyond it. Law cannot be used to alienate the inalienable. On the contrary, it is pledged to preserve what it cannot but preserve. Dignity has been invoked as what exceeds a mere catalogue of rights, but it is in their recognition that dignity looms as the inexhaustible source. What cannot be alienated cannot be fully named. Rights are not the same as dignity, for dignity requires us to go beyond the mere acknowledgement of rights, but rights are the epiphany of the dignity of the person. Rights are inviolable. They cannot be balanced against some larger social good, nor is there a point at which the individual ceases to count as much as others or even as much as all others. Infinity cannot be calculated. It is that affirmation of the incalculability of each one that is the primary legal affirmation of human dignity. When it has said more than can be said, what more can the law say? It has wholly subordinated itself to the dignity of the person who is alone capable of giving him- or herself on behalf of the whole. Rights are our refusal to trade in the untradeable. It is in the defence of rights that dignity is resplendent.
