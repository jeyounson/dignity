# **The Dignity of Marriage**

#### *Christopher Tollefsen*

THE coNCEPT 'DIGNITY' SEEMS to many to capture something important about the nature of the human person, and to express in a summary way various ethical and political conclusions that follow from that nature. Representatives of the Catholic and natural law traditions are particularly associated with such appeals; Pope John Paul II's work, for example, is suffused with references to dignity, both as describing human nature and as a ground for opposition to various kinds of action, such as abortion, euthanasia, and sexual objectification.1 'Dignity' appears elsewhere in contemporary Church documents as well, including, notably, the documents of the Second Vatican CounciF It is a well-established part of the Church's approach to the anthropology of the human condition.

Somewhat less known, perhaps, is contemporary Catholic use of the word dignity to describe the institution of marriage. 'The dignity of marriage' is an expression found more than once in *Gaudium et Spes,* 3 and is repeated by the late Pope in *Familiaris Consortio.4* Similarly, the *Catechism* speaks of 'offences against the dignity of marriage', an expression that mirrors the numerous instances in which some form of action is said to be an offence against the dignity of the human person. 5

It might be thought that this is a merely metaphorical extension of the language of the dignity of the person; dignity seems an essentially personal quality, and not to be used literally to describe an institution or cooperative arrangement of persons. I will argue, however, that the language of dignity is meant and should be taken quite seriously; dignity is predicated of marriage by analogy with its predication of persons, but not merely by a metaphorical extension. We are meant to understand some quite specific points about marriage by the language of dignity, as to its nature, its origins, its end, and its role in ethical and political life.

# The dignity of the person

Most generally, the term dignity indicates some way in which its possessor is excellent or has achieved excellence, or should be considered of value or worth, and should hence be accorded certain forms of respect. John Paul II, in his encyclical *Evangelium Vitae,* links the dignity of human life to its source as a free gift of God; and to its destination, for human beings are destined for life with God. Human dignity is also linked by the Pope to human *nature:*  human beings are made in the image of God, insofar as they are possessed of freedom and rationality.6 These three dimensions of dignity together lead to two more, which I will call the person's *ethical dignity* and his *political dignity.* Each of these, in turn, exists in two aspects, as a task that persons have to carry out, ethically and politically, and as a requirement that ethical and political forms of respect be accorded to the person. The task aspect can be indicated by the suggestion that some act is. *beneath* a person's dignity; the requirement aspect by the suggestion that some form of treatment .is *against,*  or *contrary to,* a person's dignity. ,

The Pope's threefold schema of source, nature, and destination as providing the foundational account of human dignity is pervasively influenced by revelation and theology, though not entirely to the exclusion of the deliverances of reason and the natural law. This is true·even most obviously religious claims, as, for example, that the human being is made by God and for God. There is an argument in natural reason to the existence of a creative

<sup>6</sup> See especially *Evangelium Vitae,* nos 34-8. As Luke Gormally points out, nature and destination are not entirely distinct, since what something is can be known fully only by knowing its end; I believe the same is true of the source claim, since human existence begins with God's deliberate choice, a choice which has an end; Luke Gormally, 'Pope John Paul II's teaching on human dignity and its implications for bioethics', in C. Tollefsen ( ed. ), *John Paul II s Contribution to Catholic Bioethics* (Dordrecht, NL, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2004), 7-33, at 7.

and therefore personal being whose free choice causes human persons, and all else, to be; and that argument easily leads to a natural law counterpart to the claim that human beings are made *for* God, for if we are made by a personal being, for the sake of no benefit that could accrue to *that* being, then that being acted, it would seem, exclusively for *our* good, and that fact calls for a response of gratitude on the part of human beings, and an attempt at cooperation with that being-an attempt to form a kind of friendship with it.

Still, the fullest understanding of the source and destination claims emerges within a rich religious tradition that draws upon the resources of revelation, as, for example, by understanding the ultimate destination of human persons as including eternal life in the kingdom of heaven, a form of community with all persons, and as also including, through baptism, a share in the divine nature and life of the Trinity. 7

To a greater extent, however, the claim that human beings have dignity because of their nature has been appropriated within the tradition of natural law thought. And so in what follows, I will concentrate primarily upon the claim that, as possessed of the capacities for freedom and rationality, human persons are made in the image of God and possess thereby a special, and, in earthly creation, pre-eminent form of dignity. I will show how this claim leads to both ethical and political assertions of dignity, and then tum to what I take to be analogues to these assertions in claims that can be made about marriage.

# The nature of the human person, and human dignity&

Of all the various explanations of human dignity, the most familiar is the second, that man is made in the image of God. This claim has both descriptive and normative aspects; it can only be fully understood insofar as it is recognized to point ahead of man's given nature to the nature he should take on in action.

The descriptive aspect should be understood in the following way: man is made in the image of God precisely because his existence is that of a person. Man, that is, is possessed of reason and will, and is capable of rational thought

<sup>7</sup> This theological bent is reflected in the analogues, in marriage, to personal dignity as regards source and destination. The Catholic view that marriage is an institution directly created by God, and the Catholic understanding of the sacramentality of marriage, reveal the dignity of marriage in both its source and destination, yet from a distinctly theological perspective.

<sup>8</sup> The following three paragraphs, and one paragraph in the next section, are adapted from my discussion in Christopher Tollefsen, 'A Catholic perspective on human dignity', in Steven Dilley and Nathan Palpant (eds), *Human Dignity and Bioethics: From Worldviews to the Public Square* (New York, Routledge, 2012), 49--66.

and free choice.9 This dual emphasis is found in the documents of the Second Vatican Council: in *Dignitatis Humanae,* the council writes that our 'dignity as persons' is our existence as 'beings endowed with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear personal responsibility'. 10 John Paul summarizes: 'The biblical author [in the book of *Sirach]* sees as part of this image ... those spiritual faculties which are distinctively human, such as reason, discernment between good and evil, and free will. ' 11

In these descriptions, we see an anticipation of the way in which the dignity of the person is normative, for reason and free will in us are necessary precisely so that we may bear that privilege of 'personal responsibility'. Thomas Aquinas identified this responsibility as our participation in God's eternal law; unlike the rest of earthly creation, which follows God's law by nature, human beings are given a share in divine reason, and the faculty of free choice, precisely so that they may guide and constitute themselves as the persons they are *to be* in accordance with God's planPin this active shaping of their own lives in accordance with reason, human beings are thus *like-in*  the image of-the divine. Of course, the orientation of this power must be identified: what is the substantive content of the deliverances of reason? This is the ethical dimension of dignity, to which I now fum.'

# Ethical dignity

All of the three aspects of dignity, but especially the dignity of human nature, signal two further aspects of human dignity. The first is dignity in its ethical sense; the dignity of human nature points beyond itself towards a normative dimension: dignity is something both to be respected in the human person, but also, and equally importantly, something to be realized in action.

The former sense of ethical dignity is well known to those familiar with Catholic ethics. Abortion and euthanasia, for example, are understood as contrary to the dignity of the person insofar as they involve the. intentional taking of innocent human life, which is to be at all times. Similar uses of dignity indicate that about the person which must always be respected, and are to be found in treatments of sinful social structurt;:s and political institutions, in

<sup>9</sup> SeeP. Lee and R. P. George, 'The nature and basis of human dignity', *Ratio Juris* 21 (2008}, 173-93, for a defence of this view. .

<sup>11</sup> John Paul II, *Evangelium Vitae,* no. 34.

<sup>12</sup> Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologica* (Chicago, W. Benton-Encyclopedia Britannica, 1980}, I-ll, Prologue.

Catholic appraisals of torture and terror bombing, and in Catholic discussions of sexuality: every form oftreatment in which a person is instrumentalized or objectified, or in which the fundamental goods of the person are intentionally damaged or destroyed, are considered to be contrary to human dignity.

In the latter sense, human dignity, manifest in freedom and reason, comes with a task, a task understood in the Catholic and natural law tradition ultimately to be one oflove, of freely giving of oneself to another, and others. The Second Vatican Council expresses the thought in this way: '[B]y his innermost nature man is a social being, and unless he relates himself to others he can neither live nor develop his potential.' 13 And the council goes on to say: 'man, who is the only creature on earth which God willed for itself, cannot fully find himself except through a sincere gift of himself'. 14

We see here two things. First, the earlier point about one aspect of man's dignity being found in his source-that is, God's gratuitous creation-here is joined to the second point about man's dignity as being made in the image of God. God, in creating a being for its own sake, creates that being as *able to love-that,* we here find articulated, is what it means to *be* a being capable of existing for its own sake. 15 And it is thus only in loving that man realizes, or fulfils, the nature by which he has dignity. Thus, we could say that man's constitutive dignity-the dignity he has in virtue of what he is, and in virtue of which he is entitled to full moral respect-sets on him a requirement to strive for ethical, or, as Luke Gormally has called it, existential, dignity, the dignity of excellence *as* a being capable of love and self-gift. 16

Of course, this leaves largely unstated what precisely it means to achieve excellence in love. By way of the very briefest possible summary, I will simply say that I take our normative task to be the protection of, and service to, the basic goods of human persons in *all* such persons; our fulfilment as a being called to love is to be found only in the communion that is instantiated through actiorr for the good in the person of *others;* a life lived only for the good in one's person would be deficient precisely from the standpoint of human flourishing, failing to achieve some goods altogether, and achieving no good as successfully as it could be achieved in communion with others.

### Political dignity

This social dimension of the human person, while essentially to be realized in upright action, also points towards the need for a politics of dignity, a way of understanding political action and institutions that does justice to the dignity of the human person in the dimensions just discussed. John Paul II is well known for his criticisms of a form of democratic politics (and similar criticisms of a form of unconstrained capitalism) that is entirely about the promotion of freedom at the expense of truth, a politics that distorts the existential task of man away from the gift of self and towards the satisfaction of the selfY The realm of the political is not coextensive with everything that is constitutive of genuine human well-being, nor is that realm itself a basic good ofthe human person; but an upright politics, one that achieves what we could call political dignity, is always in service of the real needs of the person. The achievement of such a politics is the task of the political dimension of our dignity; and a politics that positively thwarts human flourishing, both in its individual and social dimensions, is thus contrary to the demands of political dignity.

# The nature of marriage

I turn now to the nature and the good of marriage; doing so will enable us to see the analogy of dignity as it extends from the personal to the marital. The account I shall give could be called, for reasons that will become clear, a comprehensive union account of the nature and good of marriage; again, for reasons that will become clear, it could also be called a conjugal.account of the nature and good of marriage. 18 ·

That marriage involves a comprehensive union emerges from its guiding point, which is the intention of the spouses to enter into a *complete and mutual sharing of lives at all levels of their existence.* This point is expressed also by John Paul, who writes that men and women .'in matrimony give themselves

<sup>17</sup> The first criticism may be found in John Paul II, *Evangelium Vitae;* the second in John Paul II, *Centesimus Annus* (Vatican City, Libreria Editrice Vaticana; 1991). .

<sup>18</sup> In addition to the work of John Paul II, my account draws from work by members of the so-called 'new natural law' theory. See, for example; Girgis, George, and Anderson; 'What is marriage?', *Harvard Journal of Law and Pub lip Policy* 34 (20 1 0), 245-87. There are differences, of emphasis at least, however, between different NNL theorists, as can be seen in the work of John Finnis, who is critical of the language of 'total' self-giving in John Paul II; see Finnis, 'Sex and marriage: some myths and reasons', in *Collected Essays,* vol. 3: *Human Rights and Common Good* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2011), 353-88.

with a love that is total and therefore unique and exclusive' .19 And he writes too that marriage involves an 'ever richer union with each other on all levels'. 20 So marriage is both a union at 'all levels', and is also a total gift of self between the spouses.

These expressions require further explanation: how is the sharing oflives in marriage something that takes place at all levels? And how is that sharing something that is complete or, in the Pope's word, total? I intend to answer both questions in due course. But first, I want to address the question of the goodness of a union of this sort.

Friendship, I believe, is a basic human good: the mutual willing of one another's good is recognized by friends as good in itself, and not just for whatever beneficial consequences it brings. We just are better off, fulfilled, perfected, as human beings simply by having friends, and this is *why* we pursue friendship, even if the *what* of friendship precisely requires that one transcend one's concern for one's own good, and make our friends' good our own.

But our friendships are inevitably limited in many ways. We do not make full and total commitments to our friends to share everything; we have many friends; and the available union is physically limited: it extends only to our organic boundaries, and can go no further. Nor do we usually look for more: in seeking friends we do not seek all-encompassing union, and we are rarely if ever disturbed at the organic limitations that we experience with our friends.

Thomas Aquinas held that our non-inferential awareness of basic goods is furthered by some experiential data provided by our inclinations. And we do appear to have, as a species, a natural inclination that orients us towards an all-encompassing union different from friendship, namely erotic desire. Erotic desire could be characterized as a desire for possession, or complete oneness and unity with another; this desire is not reducible merely to a desire for sexual pleasure, though sexual desire is no stranger to erotic love. But the agent-in its grip desires the *totality* of the other person.

Erotic desire thus gives us an orientation towards, though it is not identical to, a good of a sort that, in its all-encompassing nature, goes beyond ordinary friendship. And *this* form of union is, like friendship, *itself* recognized as something fundamentally, basically, good for human persons (and so recognized even, as it may be, by people with little *experience* of erotic desire). We are capable of recognizing the object of erotic desire-a complete sharing of two lives-as an essential and intrinsic aspect of human perfection in the same way that we recognize the objects of other natural orientations

20 Pope John Paul II, *Theology of the Body* (Boston, MA, Pauline Books, 1997), 70,.

<sup>19</sup> John Paul II, *Familiaris Consortia,* no. 19.

as fundamental goods: knowledge, friendship, play, life, and health, among others. So we should see marriage-the marital union, understood as a comprehensive union-as good just in itself, and as desirable for its own sake. Marriage, in other words, is a basic human good.

It is important to ask how sex is related to, or integrated into, this good, and this leads to the conjugal description of my account of marriage. Understood as a comprehensive union, marriage was seen to involve a complete sharing of two lives, a sharing we can recognize as intrinsically desirable: thus marital union is a basic human good, perfective of us as human persons. But that union was described by the Pope as existing 'at all levels' of the spouses' lives, and the explanation of this, I believe, makes essential reference to conjugal intercourse.

On every understanding of marriage, there is *some* kind of union: spouses make mutual commitments to one another to share their lives in at least a quotidian way: they undertake the project of a life together. More robustly, that union should, normatively, bring spouses together in varim.is aspects of their existence: their character, heart, intelligence, will. Spouses are deficient in their realization of the good of marriage if their characters in no way complement or harmonize with one another; spouses whose projects are entirely at odds, or who believe nothing in common, are similarly deficient in their realization of the good of marriage. But all these forms of union do not take us much past the union of a friendship of virtue; it is, in fact, *only* sex that can do this, and thus only in sex that a married couple can achieve the form of comprehensive union unique to, and specificatory of, the good of marriage.

On the conjugal view, the marital commitment to a union at all levels finds its *realization* or *completion* in the act of sexual intercourse, an act in which spouses are joined in a bodily and organic fashion so as to become 'one flesh'. In sexual intercourse, an organic function for which each spouse is, on his or her own, physically inadequate, becomes possible, namely, the function of reproduction. Thus, insofar as they are united in sexual intercourse, the two spouses become one organism, not by way of dissolution of their separate bodily identities but by the extension ,of the unity, identified in the totality of their commitment to one another, all the way down to the physical reality of their persons. And this has a further consequence: spouses become one physical organism in sexual intercourse; but human persons are physical organisms, and so spouses can even be said to become op.e person--or perhaps one personal reality-in their sexual intercourse.

I said just now that sexual union realized or completed the marital commitment. The conjugal view thus contrasts sharply with any view that holds that the sexual act does no more than *express* that (or some other) commitment. It is true, of course, that sexual union at its best expresses marital love; but expression ultimately is controlled and guided by human choice, and what expresses one thing may, by the creative act of man, be transformed so as to express something else. If the expression of marital union is all that sex is by nature about, then why not think that sex could be used to express some other desire, form of union, or aspiration, in the way that metaphor transforms language's natural meaning to give us something 'new'?

Now this might be, in fact, all that sex 'does'. If so, then the claim of marriage to be in any sense a self-standing, basic good, is highly dubious: marriage would simply be some form of union plus sexual expressiveness. Something like this is the main contender to the comprehensive union view, yet I will argue later that only the conjugal account can really sustain the claims of dignity made by its defenders. But if sex completes-and uniquely completes-the commitment to union that makes a marriage to be, then there is no substitute for it as regards the demands of the union, and reason as well to think that sex is not so easily available for the realization of other purposes in detachment from the purpose of marriage; for when a human act is intrinsically oriented towards some human good, as belief is to truth, then deliberate detachment of that act from that good typically, and perhaps always, is, morally speaking, a misuse of the act in question.

# The dignity of marriage

In the remainder of this chapter, I wish to trace out some of the consequences of the comprehensive, or conjugal, conception of marriage for thinking about the idea of dignity. Representatives of the religious and moral traditions that have-given most attention to the conjugal conception have also spoken freely of the dignity of marriage; I will suggest that there is good reason for this, and will suggest also some of the consequences of this identification for moral and political life.

# The nature of marriage and the image of God

Though I intend to make some claims about the dignity of marriage from the standpoint of natural reason, I begin with some points drawn from biblical revelation. In the second Genesis account, man is described as being made in the image of God. But in Genesis 1, man is said to be made in God's image *as male and female.* The meaning of this will be obscure from the standpoint that sees freedom and rationality as the essence of the *imago Dei;* or it will be understood as saying no more than that both men and women possess the faculties of freedom and reason. But a different perspective becomes available when it is understood that divine freedom and reason are identical also to the love that is God, a love that constitutes the relations between the persons of the Trinity by going out from the Father to the Son, and then from the two in the procession of the Holy Spirit.

Accordingly, beings made in the image of the divine are, as I have argued, beings who are made to love. And in their complementary maleness and femaleness, human persons are uniquely capacitated to love in a way that mirrors the divine love, both in the unity constituted by that love-the unity of the spouses-and in that love's fruitfulness in bringing forth new life. Nor is this capacitation disjoined from the paradigmatic features in virtue of which persons are said to be in God's image, for, by the account earlier, the comprehensive and conjugal union of spouses by which they image divine love is a good known to the human person by natural and available to the will for choice; indeed, recognition and choice of that good are perfections, actualizations, precisely of those capacities in virtue of which human beings are traditionally thought to be in the image of God, and hence to have dignity.

To reiterate: marital love is a profound imaging of the divine precisely because by their self-giving spouses realize a unity similar to that of the unity of the divine persons; they are one flesh, as the divine persons are one Ood.21 And they mirror the fruitfulness of the divine love, a fruitfulness that exists both within the Trinity and in the relation of the divine to all creation, in the embodying of their love in another, that is, in the begetting of a child. And it is this likeness to (or imaging of) the triune divine life in both the loving unity and fecundity of spouses that is the deepest source, I believe, of the language identifying the dignity of marriage, with its close parallels to the language concerning the dignity of the person. '

Gormally has summarized these claims in an important paper on human dignity in the thought of John Paul II:

> The complementarity of man and woman in the sexual relationship which is marriage is meant to reflect the Triune God',s own life of self-giving love. The unitive and procreative dimensions of this relationship are a central manifestation in the created order ofthe truth that the fulfillment of the human person

21 Important aspects of John Paul II's thought on this matter can be found in *Familiaris Consortia,* and also in his *The Theology of the Body.* 

is to be found in the gift of self that is open to the other. Marriage belongs to the order of creation because that covenantal relationship, in which a man and a woman commit themselves unreservedly to each other, and to any new life which may be the fruit of their self-giving love, is fundamental to God's primordial design for the transmission of human life and the flourishing of human communities. 22

Gormally's discussion here indicates that the dignity of marriage as it images God cannot be detached from the ethical dignity of marriage, a point to which I shall return. But it is important here to make good on an earlier claim. The dignity of the human person as made in the image of God is, obviously enough, a religious idea; yet it is available also from the standpoint of natural reason, for by reason we can recognize both the profoundly special nature of the human being as free and rational, and also recognize that such powers are 'God-like', even if there is no God. Similarly, that in marriage two persons are enabled to become one through a mutual capacitation of a life-giving power can also be recognized as profoundly special and unlike any other relationship, sexual or non-sexual, into which persons may enter; and it can also be recognized as 'god-like' *if* we recognize that a God, if such a being existed, would, in order to be perfect, be not just very loving but *identical* to His love; and also if we recognize the essential tendency of love-as-self-giving to be creative. The comprehensive or conjugal conception of marriage thus gives *us* an imaged understanding of God, a being we would understand the less were we not acquainted with the unity, fidelity, and fecundity of marriage.

# The ethical dignity of marriage

The ethical dignity of the person was to be found both in the sense that the person deserved respect if the requirements of his dignity were to be met by others, and that the person was set a task in virtue of his dignity, a task through success in which the person would, as it were, live up to the demands of his dignity, and achieve moral, or existential, dignity. There are analogues to both senses of personal dignity in the dignity of marriage, though they are closely intertwined.

In fact, most of the primary ethical offences against marriage are committed by those charged with the ethical task of marriage. What constitutes that task, and what sets the standard by which offences are to be judged, is

<sup>22</sup> Gormally, 'Pope John Paul II's teaching', 13.

the nature of marriage. For as a comprehensive union fully realized in the conjugal act, marriage requires of spouses that they be exclusively faithful to one another until death. Accordingly, both adultery and divorce, not simply in the sense of civil divorce accompanying justified separation but in the sense of an attempt to sever the marriage bond, are both offences of the married and offences against marriage itself, failures to do the institution itself justice as well as, typically, failures to do justice to its members.

Moreover, and here more controversially, marital exclusivity and fidelity is expected, in the natural law and Catholic traditions, to be prepared for in the lives of all human persons by premarital chastity. The marital commitment calls for the greatest possible realization of oneness between spouses, in physical union; and, as the norm against adultery indicates, this oneness is not compatible with that oneness being shared by one spouse (or both, of course) with a third person. What is shared with that third person is no longer uniquely one to the married couple.

This demand for unique unity-it sounds redundant, but I think it is not, really -extends backward to the time before marriage. To *have* given one's capacity for bodily oneness to another before being married is incompatible with the demand of the marital commitment to become one-uniquely onewith one's spouse. And it is not simply a logical requirement: without repentance, one's prior willingness to become one with someone not one's spouse incapacitates one for making the choice-the commitment-that makes a marriage to be in the first place, for one is committed by one's choicesagain, barring repentance-to making a gift of *less* than one's full capacity for oneness with one's spouse. Premarital sex is thus a kind ofmutilation'of one's moral capacity for the good of marriage, wrong in a way similar to the wrongs of other mutilations that render one incapacitated for a basic good.

But in being a failure to live up to the task of marriage, it is also, again, an offence against the dignity of marriage itself: widespread failure as regards this norm systematically undermines the institution, renders its nature and desirability opaque, and, in the practical consequences of the refusal to commit oneself in one's entirety to one and only one other that premarital sex involves, it seems to make both adultery and divorce more, rather than less, common. And the same is surely true of both non-mutual and non-marital kinds of sexual acts as well. For example, if, in marriage, one makes of one's body, insofar as it is a sexual body, a gift to one's spouse, pledging that body's capacity for unity with another exclusively to that spouse, then a willingness to make use of one's sexual capacity for one's *own* (solitary) enjoyment would appear to be a form of infidelity to one's spouse similar to the kind of infidelity that pre- or extramarital sex is.

# The political dignity of marriage

I come now to the political dignity of marriage, a topic continuous with the constitutive and ethical dignity of marriage, for the ways in which marriage is excellent from the standpoint of the *polis* flow from its nature and its ethical requirements; and the political forms of disrespect that can be shown to the dignity of marriage also typically involve misunderstandings of the ethics of marriage. In this section, I first identify some of the ways in which the institution of marriage is political in a broad sense: a contributor to the social and political common good of a society. This contribution is the political task of marriage. I then identify three ways in which a political society can fail, in some cases radically, to respect the dignity of marriage.

The account I have given ofthe nature and good of marriage is one I have characterized as comprehensive and conjugal. But so far, it might seem that it is also private; why should any union, even one comprehensive and conjugal in nature, be thought to be of political significance? The answer to this question has been a staple of the philosophical consideration of marriage since Plato; but I will attempt to bring it out with some force through a thought experiment.

Suppose, then, that marriage was constituted around a different form of organic unity than that which I have identified. Suppose, for example, that at age thirty human beings ceased to be digestively adequate, and that a biological union of a digestive nature was the common, and perhaps even orgasmically pleasurable, form of union available to us in answer both to our desire for a more profound unity with another than ordinary friendships can provide, and to our need to digest our food adequately. Let us imagine that a social institution develops around this possibility, called marriage*. And let us further imagine that the question arises whether marriage* should be given the protection of the laws; or whether other relationships, perhaps not involving biological unity but nevertheless involving commitments to unity and some form of sexual pleasure, should be given equal standing in the law; or whether, perhaps, the institution of marriage should be considered an altogether private affair, of no significant political importance.

Would the (no doubt fantastic) scenario just described generate the sort of controversy that attempts to open up the definition of marriage in our actual world have? Would the social institution of marriage* be thought to possess the same degree of significance which defenders oftraditional marriage claim is intrinsic to marriage as they understand it *simply* because it involved a form of biological union between the spouses? Would it be something that it made sense to think of having political *dignity?* 

I think the answer here is no; there would be a reasonable inclination here, even on the part of supporters of marriage*, to think that perhaps there really was something merely biological about the one-flesh digestive union. No doubt this union would be special, and orgasmic pleasure is perhaps never to be sneered at. But this form of union nevertheless, I suspect, would not strike us as the foundational form of human relationships, precisely because, while digestive activities sustain and are of manifest importance in the biological and practical economies of human persons, these activities are not truly *creative.* 

The biological union of man and woman in conjugal intercourse, by contrast, is not just, and really not *even,* the engagement of an organic function necessary for the survival of the parties engaged in it. It is, instead, the performance of a biological function that, when successful, introduces something new *into* the world; and not just some *thing* but, in fact, a new *person.* The creativity that sexual reproduction manifests is spectacular, in two directions. Looking back to its motivations, it is a creativity that flows from a mutual commitment that is perhaps the paradigmatic form of love, a commitment to make a complete gift of oneself to another.

But by *loving* one another as they have pledged to, spouses are enabled, not, obviously, in every case but generally and for the most part, to realize a form of creativity otherwise unavailable. And, looking forward, the creativity in question involves the creation of a sort of being the reality of which· is uniquely commensurate to the reality of two loving persons, namely another *person.* That child-persons should be the fruit of marital love is thus essential to the personal significance of the biological union to the spouses, which is, by virtue of its origins and its ends, anything but 'merely' biologic8;1.

Looking now from an even broader perspective than what has been discussed here, we see that the social significance ofthis union well beyond the interests of the two parties in their creative capacity. For while the digestive union described above would maintain 'digestive spouses'·in existence, the sexual union, insofar as· it comes to its complete fruition, is the organic function responsible for the survival of both a political society, and even of the species. And, in the natural overflow of the commitment to be open to new life that is internal to the commitment to a mutual complete sharing of lives, there is also a further commitment not just to the procreation but to the rearing and education of children. There is a commitment to bringing these children to a point at which they too are capable of commitments, sociality, and, ultimately, marriage and parenthood.

There is a commitment, in other words, to perpetuating the foundational conditions necessary not just for the continuation of the species but for the continuation of civilization--ours, or any; this is the political task of marriage, or, put another way, the task side of the political dignity of marriage. And this, surely, is the source of the political significance of this institution, and is likewise the reason why the state justifiably takes an interest in the good and institution of marriage; for marriage is thereby of crucial importance to the political common good, as well as to the personal common good of spouses.

Now the ways in which a state must respect the dignity of marriage emerge more or less clearly to the extent that one acknowledges the ethical and especially political dignity of marriage, an acknowledgement that, I have argued, requires a prior understanding of the nature and good of marriage, and of the relationship between that good and the conjugal act. So I here identify, briefly, some of the ways that the state might fail to respect this dignity.

One way, I believe, is by eroding the institutional framework that makes it possible for participants in the good to recognize the stringency of the commitment involved in marriage and the consequent norm of permanence. There can be room, I believe, even in a civil law that respects fully the nature and norms-in a word, the dignity--of marriage, for civil divorce; but various of the actual forms of civil divorce that have been embraced, most especially no-fault divorce, make it increasingly difficult for spouses to understand what they are doing as oriented towards permanence.

A second way in which the dignity of marriage can be traversed politically is by the detachment of the political recognition that the institution is afforded from an acknowledgement of the way that the marriage is, by its nature, intrinsically oriented towards procreation. Most notably, this is done by the redefinition of marriage as something that requires only mutual commitment plus sexual expression, an understanding that, in its abandonment of the necessity of sexual complementarity in the spouses, similarly abandons a directedness towards procreation as intrinsic to what marriage is.

I believe that in doing so, the state in fact makes it" opaque why marriage, as opposed to other relationships of mutual commitment, many of which involve no sexual forms of expression but are nevertheless expressive in other ways, should receive the special attention of the law. The state thereby also makes it more difficult to live in accordance with the conjugal conception in at least two ways. First, a grasp of that conception is made more elusive by the lack of widespread social recognition of that conception; and second, the choices and commitments necessary to undertake life in accordance with that conception are also made more difficult in a cultural context in which sexual· intercourse is widely viewed merely as expressive and not genuinely unitive, a context in which, severed from the connection to children, sexual activity

may be, and is by many, engaged in *at will.* The appeal of *this* conception to the young is obvious, and the achievement of working oneself out of one's ensnarement to this conception is rare, and often achieved only with great difficulty.

A third way in which the state fails to respect the dignity of marriage, ethical and political, concerns the state's relationship to education. The responsibility, and accordingly the right, of parents to educate their own children, or have them educated, in accordance with their own religious, moral, and metaphysical understandings, is a direct outgrowth of the commitment to unionopen-to-new-life: that commitment would be truncated if it did not come also with the commitment to educate to maturity.23 But states are to a considerable extent either oblivious or hostile to this most primordial right of parents to care for their children, and of children to be cared for by their parents. States that forbid home-schooling, or that make undue ideological requirements on children's education, or that take advantage of schemes for public schooling as a way of advancing world views contrary to that of many parents without providing ample opt-outs, and so on; all are failures to respect the dignity of marriage at the political level, both directly and indirectly, since such failures often make it more difficult for families to pass on the knowledge and virtues required for the forming of future families in a stable and morally upright way.

To all this, I will add in conclusion a fourth failing, less political than cultural but one directly analogous to a similar failing as regards personal dignity. The account of personal dignity given in the Catholic tradition focuses especially on human reason and freedom. But it was a frequent complaint of the late Pope that modem understandings of human dignity have focused too much on a conception of freedom divorced from truth: freedom merely as self-expression, self-assertion, and self-satisfaction. The Pope believed that such an understanding of freedom, and of the dignity of beings possessed of such freedom, was ultimately a great threat to the good of human persons, especially those not yet or no longer able to assert themselves against the desires of others. And so, in the Pope's view, the 'culture of death', with its commitment to abortion and euthanasia, was a natural outgrowth of this more limited conception of freedom and human dignity. '

Culturally, a similar error pervades our understanding of the dignity of marriage. Marriage is understood as a paradigmatic expression of freedom, yet freedom to marry and freedom in marriage are understood in a thin and often normatively unconstrained manner. The account that I have given here,

<sup>23</sup> I have addressed this point at greater length in Christopher Tollefsen, 'John Paul II and children's education', *Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics, and Public Policy* 21 (2007), 159-89.

however, of the nature of marriage and of the dignity of marriage, can only emerge if the possibility of a *true,* and hence normative, conception of marriage is not closed off at the outset. But any such conception, if it exists, will inevitably be resistant to the claim that mere desire to participate in the institution of marriage should suffice as grounds for a right to participate. And it will likewise be resistant to the claim that the norms within marriage--of exclusivity, permanence, openness to children-are available to be rewritten in their entirety. An institution available for such restructuring at will is an institution with no real nature, and it is difficult, if not impossible, to see in what the dignity of such an institution could reside.
