# **In Defence of Human Dignity: Comments on Kant and Rosen**

#### *Thomas E. Hill, Jr.*

FoR MANY YEARS, IMMANUEL KANT has been recognized as the most important philosopher to defend the idea that human dignity is at the core of our shared moral beliefs and practices. His influence is undeniable, but his critics have been many. Michael Rosen is among the most articulate and informed critics. In his chapter for this volume1 and his recent book *Dignity: Its History and Meaning,2* Rosen traces the history of the idea of dignity from Stoic philosophers to Kant and beyond, along the way calling our attention to separate strands of thought and apparent objections. He makes the history accessible and the objections vivid. His brief historical survey should help to awaken public interest in the topic, and his thought-provoking commentary should be a welcome challenge to scholars, theologians, and philosophers who take human dignity to be a coherent and defensible concept. Lawyers and judges, especially where human dignity is written into their constitution, should find Rosen's work a valuable exploration of theoretical questions that underlie their practical problems in trying to find reasonable applications. Philosophers inspired by Kant will be especially keen to examine critically his extended of dignity in Kant's philosophy, and perhaps to propose a Kantian response.

To disclose my own history and perspective, I belong to the large group of philosophers inspired by Kant even though (like Rosen) I am critical of Kant at many points. My brief remarks here are not intended as a full review of the topic or of Rosen's contributions, but I do want to offer some supplement to Rosen's treatment of Kant and some response to the objections that he raises. I will comment very briefly on the following issues: (1) the alleged neglect of dignity among contemporary philosophers; (2) the indeterminacy

of the idea of dignity and consequently its liability to abuse; (3) the apparently disconnected strands of thought commonly associated with dignity; and ( 4) the alleged inadequacy of Kant's conception of human dignity for practical applications (e.g., vagueness and absolutism). Rosen's most important objection, however, concerns Kant's basis for affirming the dignity of every human person. That is, (5) Kant's apparent attempt to ground human dignity on the premise that there is in each person an awesome 'transcendental kernel' of a noumenal *we-know-not-what.* The problem is that this would mean that Kant derives his ethical belief from unsupportable, non-empirical metaphysics.

# Preliminary points: contemporary resources and potential abuse of theories

The first point is a minor one. In a short survey for a general audience, Rosen understandably wanted to avoid the distractions of scholarly controversy, and in this he succeeds very well. He acknowledges that discussions of how to interpret Kant's moral philosophy, for example his idea of moral duty, are 'densely populated', but he chooses not to engage with this literature in order simply to propose 'in an exploratory spirit' a 'radically unorthodox' interpretation.3 New proposals should be welcome, but his further suggestion that contemporary philosophers have neglected Kant's idea of dignity may be misleading. As he says, there has not been 'a large systematic body of contemporary philosophical literature' in this area,4 but virtually every major commentary on Kant's ethics presents a view of the place and arguments for dignity, and commentators often treat this as a core concept. Rosen's choice not to engage in scholarly disputes makes sense, given his aims, but readers should be aware ofthe relevant literature on the topic. 5

Second, as Rosen notes, a persistent and troublesome problem with the idea of dignity as it appears in many contexts is that it sounds high-minded and inspirational but is so indefinite that it can serve as a banner for many different and conflicting causes. 6 Indefinite ideals are liable to abuse because there are no fixed criteria to prevent unscrupulous debaters from appealing to the ideal to sanctify their self-serving projects. There is a similar liability in political rhetoric about 'freedom' and 'democracy' when these terms are used apart from contexts that can give them specific meaning. No moral concept or doctrine, of course, can be defined so specifically that it will be completely immune from misuse and abuse. The problem often lies with the aims and motives of those who would rather exploit an indefinite concept than look for or construct a more determinate interpretation. If, however, the concept of dignity is left completely indefinite, it cannot serve the guiding function that Kant and others thought that it could have. This is the more important problem to which I tum in the next two sections.

# Can diverse ideas of dignity be coherently unified?

Turning to the third issue, different strands of thought are commonly associated with *dignity,* as Rosen explains: (a) a rank or status, (b) intrinsic value, (c) 'measured and self-possessed behaviour', and (d) respectful treatment,? Moral philosophers who affirm human dignity should specify strands they intend, and, if there are several, they should indicate how they fit together in a coherent systematic theory. In Kant's work, I think, all these elements are present, but the relationships among them are not obvious. To explain how they can fit together coherently is a challenge, but not an impossible task. All too briefly, as a first step I would say the following.

Regarding (a), in Kant's view, every human person has a *status* of dignity, which consists of rights, duties, and respect-worthiness that animals lack. It is the status of equality before the moral law and the status of a moral 'lawmaker', that is, a person who shares in the common practical reason that specifies what the basic law requires. The kinds of protections, responsibilities, and honour that are due to a person who has this status cannot simply be read off the word 'dignity', which (as Rosen reminds us) has a chequered history and multiple common uses. Instead, what is due depends on many complex

factors that determine how the fundamental moral law (for Kant 'the Categorical Imperative') should be interpreted and applied.8 On my reading, the status of human dignity is a moral standing that follows from the fundamental moral law. It is not a mysterious metaphysical 'kernel' from which we derive our belief in the moral law and its practical applications.

Regarding (b), Kant does imply that dignity is a status that can be ex. pressed in terms of *intrinsic value* in a sense, though not necessarily in the senses most familiar to us. Persons with dignity are 'ends-in-themselves', and so are not to be treated merely as means or treated with indifference.9 They are not 'ends to be produced' but exist as beings with a special status and value that Kant contrasts with 'relative value'. 10 As members of a possible 'kingdom of ends', their dignity is contrasted with mere price-'market price' and 'attachment price'." Dignity is also described as an 'inner worth' and an 'unconditional and incomparable worth' _12 This implies that dignity is a worth not dependent on a person's talents, accomplishments, class, race, gender, sexual orientations, or even moral record. 13 More strikingly, dignity is not merely 'above price' but it is also 'without equivalent'. 14 That is, dignity is not a commensurable value that permits trade-offs. Even if, tragically, we must sometimes make decisions that cannot protect all persons from assaults on their dignity, we cannot justify the sacrifice of any one simply by reasoning that two are worth twice as much as one, and so on. How the special value of dignity can function in practical applications is subject to interpretation, but Kant's own view can be best seen in his system of ethical principles in his late work, *The Metaphysics of Morals,* especially Part II. For now, however, the

<sup>8</sup> Kant expresses his understanding of the fundamental moral law· in Immanuel Kant, *Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals,* ed. Thomas E. Hill, Jr and Arnulf Zweig (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2002), 221-40 (4:420-40). Bracketed numbers refer to the volume and pages in the standard Prussian Academy edition. The formulation is the imperative to treat humanity in each person as an end in itself. This is at least an important aspect of human dignity, but the more specific duties, rights, and attitudes that recognition of human dignity requires must be derived from all aspects of the basic moral law together with general facts about the human 'condition.

<sup>9</sup> To treat someone merely as a means is to treat the person as a means but not at the same time as an end in himself. So 'treat not merely as a means' is not a standard independent of 'treat as an end in itself', contrary to what Rosen suggests. See Rosen, *Dignity,* 82-5. In addition, the latter goes beyond the former, forbidding indifference to other persons even if one is not using them as a means at all. See Kant, *Groundwork,* 231 (4:430), and Immanuel Kant, *The Metaphysics of Morals,* trans. Mary Gregor (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1996), 157 (6:395).

<sup>14</sup> Kant, *Groundwork,* 235 (4:434).

more important question is the interpretation of 'intrinsic value' implied by dignity. It might seem that by attributing both a status and a value associated with dignity Kant conflates two distinct and independent ideas, but I think not. The key to understanding is that for Kant the moral law is prior to value ('the good') and determines what is objectively valuable. 15 That is, objective value claims are implicitly claims about what is or would be willed by persons who are fully governed by morally committed practical reason. In effect, then, to say that persons have the special intrinsic value of dignity is just to say that any fully rational and reasonable person would (and so we should) grant them the special status (rights, responsibilities, and honour) that the moral law (a law of reason) requires. Kant describes this status in abstract and relatively formal terms in his earlier work, and then, taking account of real human conditions, he develops a thicker, more substantive conception in his later work. 16

Turning to (c), what Rosen calls 'measured and self-possessed behaviour' is the idea that one should act in a *dignified* way as befitting one's class and social status. Undeniably this idea was historically important and important to Kant in his personal life. His moral theory, however, transforms the idea, making it appropriate to his conception of all human persons as fundamentally moral equals with basic capacity and rational predisposition to relate to others with due respect for standards that can in principle be justified to all. Thus the relevant class and status is that of human beings with dignity, and the 'dignified' behaviour that this calls for is whatever in context expresses one's valuing of this status. Although Kant does not make the point explicitly, the relevant standards for dignified behaviour must include the duties to oneself not to debase humanity in one's person-by servility, lying, gluttony, drunkenness, or any sexual practices incompatible with respect for oneself and others. 17 There is no obvious conflict between this idea of being dignified and other aspects of dignity described above, and arguably the status and value aspects of dignity support the prescription to behave in a dignified way in Kant's limited sense.

Finally, regarding (d), Kant held that we acknowledge the dignity of humanity by *treating every person with respect.* 18 Respect for the moral law demands basic respect for every human person, no matter how disliked, useless,

or misbehaving. The respect in question is not the special honour and deference we give to those in high office or those who are especially talented or accomplished. It is rather an expressed recognition, appropriate to the context, that the person has the fundamentally equal status· and value of dignity as determined by the moral law, that is, (a) and (b) above. The duty to respect others is not (as some suggest) the general requirement to treat persons with dignity as ends-in-themselves, but rather a derivative and more specific duty comparable to the duties of love, gratitude, and friendship. 19 Kant also thought that self-respect is important. A kind of respect for oneself as a person with rights and responsibilities is virtually inevitable, Kant thought, but we should also try to conduct ourselves in a manner worthy of this status, that is, in selfrespecting ways. Again, this is an aspect of human dignity that fits well with the other aspects that we have considered.

# Problems of application: indeterminacy and absolutism

A theory with a vague, 'squishy', indeterminate idea at its core not only is likely to be exploited but also, more importantly, it frustrates the efforts of well-meaning followers to use it in practical contexts.20 This apparently is the current fate of dignity in legal systems of Europe, Israel, and elsewhere. Kant discusses dignity so infrequently and abstractly that critics understandably find it unready for use in guiding decisions in particular troublesome casesY To assess the charge that Kant's conception of dignity is too indeterminate to provide any guidance would require a fuller examination ofKant's texts than is possible here, but readers can find detailed attempts to explain the practical implications of Kant's conception in recent commentaries.22 The place to look for Kant's own (rather belated) efforts to apply his theory is primarily *The Metaphysics of Morals.* Here again and again he appeals to the dignity of humanity to underwrite self-regarding duties and duties to others. His arguments may fail to convince, but they reveal more determinacy in his idea of dignity than one might initially suspect. In general, we should recognize that Kant

was a systematic moral theorist whose references to dignity were not freefloating but embedded in a theoretical network of ideas, including conceptions of a person, the will, autonomy, and practical reason that do not completely match ours. As John Rawls explained and illustrated in his own work, abstract ideals (like human freedom, equality, and dignity) require a more concrete interpretation to be developed in a systematic theory that can generate practical applications. As Rosen in effect acknowledges in his own discussion of Kant, one-shot intuitive objections are unlikely to bring down a major moral theory. What is needed is to understand, offer our best reconstructions, and compare the theory as a whole to available alternatives.

Among the most persistent objections to Kant's idea of human dignity is that it generates apparent conflicts of duty. Dignity is presented as an absolute status or value, never to be violated and always to be respected. In the real world, however, life can present us with tragic choices in which what seems demanded in order to respect the dignity of one person would violate the dignity of others. Especially in Kantian ethics, 'ought' implies 'can', and so if we cannot respect the dignity of all then this cannot be our duty.23 Examples abound. It seemed impossible during the Second World War to rescue oppressed people from the indignities inflicted on Jews and others without bombing raids that burned to death innocent children. Mothers submitted to debasing prostitution to keep their families from starving. A secret agent in a just cause might have joined the enemy in degrading mockery and racial slurs to avoid detection long enough to gather and pass on information vital to protecting others. Dwarf-tossing intuitively seems demeaning, but many would say that to override the dwarf's voluntary consent is disrespectful. Resolution here is not easy, maybe even impossible, but a distinction may help to preserve Kant's central thesis even if it does not square with some of his own particular moral beliefs. As I explain elsewhere,24 what should be regarded absolutely inviolable is the general principle that human dignity is always to be respected, but specific derivative principles that would honour human dignity under ideal circumstances cannot always be satisfied in particular tragic cases. In this situation, we must not resort to unconstrained consequentialist decision-making but, instead, try to judge what best respects the more specific values (and their priorities) that the dignity principle aspires to protect-the values, for example, of life, freedom, non-degradation, mutual respect, and

happiness (insofar as it can be achieved by permissible means). Principles for ideal conditions may be subject to exceptions in real world conditions so long as the exceptions are justifiable from the same moral standpoint that incorporates the dignity principle. Hard cases cannot be avoided, but moral theories should aim to describe the moral perspective that a conscientious person should take in trying to resolve them. Also, a reasonable reconstruction of Kant's basic moral standards does not necessarily justify his belief in absolute prohibitions regarding particular issues, such as lying, revolution, and 'unnatural' sexual practices. Kant, like great theorists of all kinds, was not necessarily the best judge of how his theory applies to particular cases. The challenge for those inspired by his thought is to reconstruct how the best insights, reflectively modified, can be unified and defended.

# Metaphysics or morals?

The most persistent obstacle to acceptance of Kant's conception of morality is the widely shared impression that it is hopelessly mired in an obscure and untenable metaphysics. Rosen focuses this general concern on Kant's idea of the dignity of humanity, especially insofar as this dignity-seen as an inner 'transcendental kernel'-is taken to be the metaphysical basis ofKant's practical affirmation of dignity as fundamental feature of a rational morality. The concern is understandable, but in my opinion misguided. Granted, when Kant tried boldly and honestly to reconcile his deepest moral and religious convictions with his earlier radical explanation of the foundations of empirical knowledge, he was led to write of 'things-in-themselves', noumena, 'an intelligible world' beyond empirical understanding. What Kant meant remains controversial, but few philosophers today, I think, see compelling reasons to accept the most radical conclusions to which Kant apparently felt driven. Kant's solution, however, has been interpreted in many ways, the most plausible of which emphasize that Kant used metaphysical 'Ideas' without intending to assert more than can be affirmed from the practical standpoint. More importantly, Kant did not base his argument for believing in human dignity on premises about noumena, the intelligible world, and so on, but rather used these Ideas to reconcile his prior moral conclusions (about dignity, duty, moral worth, etc.) with the earlier argument that all empirical phenomena must be regarded as governed by natural causes.25

<sup>25</sup> Any moral theorist except the most extreme naturalistic reductionist has the challenge to reconcile ordinary ideas of intending, doing things for reasons, having moral obligations, and so on, with corn-

To explain, I will first distinguish Kant's normative claims about dignity as a moral status and value from some other claims with which it might be confused. Then I will sketch briefly Kant's strategies to defend his claims. These strategies include 'analytical' arguments based on common moral convictions that he takes to be undeniable.26 He also offered a 'synthetical' kind of argument (from free will to morality), but again that argument apparently turned out to rest on our moral convictions. Finally, I will explain why I think Kant's arguments have been mistakenly thought to derive ethics, including dignity, from metaphysics.

Kant's assertion that humanity (so far as it is capable of morality) has dignity is a strong moral claim. The same is true for the similar contentions that humanity in each person is an end in itself,27 and that persons (as ends in themselves in a kingdom of ends) have dignity, 'an unconditional and incomparable worth' .28 Moral claims, on Kant's analysis, are ultimately about what is unconditionally (categorically) rational to do or, as we might say, what we have overriding reason to do even though we might fail to do what reason requires.29 As often noted, Kant's conception of full rationality in the practical sphere includes what we might call being 'reasonable', that is, not merely intelligent pursuit of one's own ends but also constraining oneself by principles that take into account the interests and wills of others. To say that we morally 'ought' or 'must' refrain from acting in certain ways entails that there are compelling reasons to refrain, whether or not it serves our contingent ends or promotes our happiness. Particular judgments of this kind presuppose that there are fundamental rational principles that stand behind the particular moral 'ought' judgments, explaining why the particular moral judgments are warranted in the circumstances. Kant's claims that humanity has dignity, persons are ends in themselves, and so on, are part of his attempt to express those fundamental rational principles that particular moral judgments presuppose.

'fhese various expressions of the moral and unconditionally rational requirement to treat humanity with dignity must be distinguished from other claims with which they might be confused. For example, they are not reducible to empirical hypotheses that human beings with a certain level of testable intelligence and competence at practical tasks do in fact behave, speak, and

plete deterministic causation in nature, if that is taken for granted. Admitting, with Kant, that there is much we do, and perhaps cannot, know and explain seems at least a reasonable aspect of a thoughtful response.

feel in certain predictable ways. Kant (like Aquinas and many others) did believe that competent adult human beings implicitly recognize the rationality of basic moral principles and are inevitably motivated by them to some degree, even if they choose not to conform. In effect, Kant had a model of what it is to be a rational agent with certain vulnerabilities that are common to human beings. Anyone who is a rational agent of that kind, he argues a priori, is subject to the moral law (including its requirement to respect human dignity), but his belief that the model applies to virtually all flesh and blood human beings-that they are rational agents in his sense--is a quasi-empirical belief. The model cannot make sense of the behaviour of trees, cockroaches, lions, and maybe some human sociopaths, but Kant thought it fitted real human beings as he knew them. The belief that real human beings in fact acknowledge the moral law is, of course, not the same as the moral law itself-a normative or prescriptive principle implying that it is rationally required to act in certain ways (if one can). Finally, the normative principle prescribing respect for human dignity does not itself assert anything that belongs to metaphysics, as this is traditionally conceived. Metaphysics so conceived is about the world *as it is,* and it is the product of theoretical reason. Ethics is about our aims and choices *as they ought to be,* and it is the product of practical reason. Metaphysics, using reason theoretically beyond what we can experience, is severely limited, and can only establish possibilities of things we cannot know or comprehend but can only 'think' speculatively.30 In sum, Kant's affirmation of human dignity is a normative claim about what is rationally imperative for those who have moral capacities. It is not an empirical claim, it is not an expression of Kant's belief that virtually all real human beings actually acknowledge the moral law, and it is not an assertion of metaphysics based on theoretical reason. '

Kant's main strategy to identify and defend his supreme moral principlethe Categorical Imperative in all its forms-was to argue analytically that 'common rational knowledge of morality' presupposes the supreme principle as the basis for its particular judgments. Famously, in *Groundwork* I Kant starts from the proposition that only a good will is good without qualification. He then argues through a series of steps that the principle of a good will is to act only on maxims that one can will as universal laws. In *Groundwork*  II he starts from the intuitively understood distinction between the imperatives of prudence and skill and the imperatives of morality. Analytical-style argument is supposed to reveal that particular moral imperatives, such as the

<sup>30</sup> This is a major conclusion of *Kant s Critique of Pure Reason* (1781 and 1787), trans. Norman Kemp Smith (New York, StMartin's Press, 1965).

duty not to make false promises, presuppose as their basis the same basic principle-that one ought to act only on maxims that one can will as universal laws. In addition, because the particular duty is understood as not conditional on whether the false promise would serve one's personal ends, the supreme principle, Kant argued, must express an unconditional (categorical) rational requirement. Then, again analytically relying on our common understanding of morality, Kant argues for the different formulations of the Categorical Imperative, which include the prescriptions associated with the idea of human dignity. It is unnecessary to examine the details of the arguments in order to see the main point: Kant does not argue from metaphysics to ethics but rather from common moral beliefs to the more comprehensive basic principle on which they are based.

In *Groundwork* III Kant proposes to supplement the analytical arguments by arguing synthetically to address the sceptical thought that morality might be merely an illusion,31 that is, that all the moral requirements we take to be rational may not be so, at least not for us. He argues from definitions that supreme moral principle must be rationally valid even for imperfectly rational beings like us *if we have free will.* Then he argues that we cannot help but act 'under the Idea of freedom' and so we can reasonably take ourselves to be subject to the supreme principle. Surprisingly, he acknowledges that he seems to be arguing in a circle-from morality to free will and from free will to morality.32 Why? The best explanation, I think, is that he suspected that we cannot help but act under the Idea of freedom because that is a presupposition of our prior understanding ourselves as moral agents. If so, again the argument would not be from metaphysics to ethics but from moral belief to a practical use of a metaphysical Idea-a free will that theoretical reason cannot confirm, refute, or even comprehend. Kant does go on to claim that he finds a way out of the circle in the distinction between 'the intelligible world' and 'the sensible world',33 but the argument, I think, in the end, simply relies on our broader understanding of ourselves (not reducible to empirical propositions) as capable of active thinking-a practical presupposition rather than a metaphysical foundation. In his *Critique of Practical Reason,* Kant abandoned the *Groundwork* III argument that prompted the suspicion of circular reasoning. Instead he simply asserts consciousness of the moral law as a 'fact ofreason' 34 which we cannot help but acknowledge when we see duty in conflict with self-interest, for example, when refusing a king's order to give false witness

would endanger one's life. This all too brief sketch of Kant's argument here skips over much detail, but the main point should be evident. Kant bases his case for human dignity on moral grounds, not on metaphysics. He thought he had to use admittedly incomprehensible metaphysical Ideas (e.g., a noumenal free will) to square his moral conclusions with his earlier conclusions about deterministic natural causation in the empirical realm, but arguably we need not follow him there.

Finally, why would one suspect that Kant bases human dignity on metaphysics? I can think of three sorts of reasons, but none that I find compelling. First, the titles of two of his major works on ethics make reference to 'a *metaphysics* of morals', but this is misleading. Kant's *Critique of Pure Reason,*  which he never repudiates, is a sustained critique of traditional metaphysics as speculative use of reason beyond possible experience. Later works argue for that the use of metaphysical Ideas is legitimate for practical purposes onlywhich do not include the traditional metaphysicians' survey of furniture of the universe. A metaphysics *of morals* is *metaphysics* in a special sense: a coherent system of rational moral principles.35 Second, there are many passages, especially in works in which Kant presents his themes to a general audience,36 where Kant's metaphorical language, if taken literally, seems to imply the metaphysical existence of strange entities 'inside' us. Rosen's repeated references to this 'inner kernel' aggravates the problem, suggesting that Kant foolishly thought that a surgeon might find it by opening up a patient's chest or, perhaps worse, that it is a lump of something invisible and intangible in there. Kant's points, as Sensen and others argue, are really about how we ought to treat ourselves and others who have rational moral capacities. Third, some scholars apparently accept a metaphysical realist picture of the 'awesome' value of humanity as Kant's bedrock foundation for ethics, taking this to be the key to his arguments for treating humanity as an end in itself.37 Other scholars disagree, rightly I think, but readers will need to decide for themselves.

<sup>35</sup> A metaphysics is a 'pure philosophy', and a metaphysics *of morals* is concerned with 'laws of freedom', that is, 'laws according to which everything ought to happen' though may not.

A metaphysics of morals is 'a system of a priori cognition from concepts alone' that is about choices (not nature). *The Metaphysics of Morals,* 10 (6:216-17). *The Metaphysics of Morals* in fact lays out what Kant took to be the first principles of a system of pure (a priori) moral principles as applied to general human conditions.

<sup>36</sup> These include Kant's *Lectures on Ethics,* ed. Peter Heath and J. B .. Schneewind, trans. Peter Heath (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1997), to which Rosen often refers, and Kant's Doctrine of Virtue in *The Metaphysics of Morals.* 

<sup>37</sup> See Allen Wood, *Kantian Ethics,* Oliver Sensen, *Kant on Human Dignity,* Richard Dean, *The Value of Humanity in Kant's Moral Theory,* and Christine Korsgaard, *Creating the Kingdom of Ends.* 

In sum, although undeniably there are problems in Kant's moral philosophy (as any other), not even his so-called 'metaphysics of morals' actually tries to base morals on metaphysics (as traditionally conceived). The central point is that as human beings with the capacity to be moral we must treat ourselves and all others with the respect, restraint, and positive concern that for Kant is encapsulated in the idea of human dignity. This is not something we should believe because we see that we literally possess an 'inner transcendental kernel' of some mystical thing but rather because, on due reflection, we can see that respecting human dignity represents (abstractly) a deeply embedded core presupposition of the common morality that we share, despite our legitimate disagreements regarding many particular issues. If a metaphysics class can help to dispel philosophical worries about the basics of how we should treat each other, then so much the better-but it should not be necessary. Our task is to live up to our implicit commitment to human dignity, which too easily we find excuses to ignore.
