# **Dignity in a Legal Context: Dignity as an Absolute Right**

*Dieter Grimm* 

#### Dignity as legal notion

DoEs IT MAKE A DIFFERENCE whether a term like 'dignity' appears in a theological or philosophical text or in a law? The answer requires a reflection on what distinguishes a law from those texts. The characteristic of a law, its specific way of existing, is its legal validity ( *Geltung).* It commands, prohibits, or allows human behaviour with the force of law. It is neither a divine command nor a moral obligation, although such norms may be at the origin of a legal norm or coexist with it. The law is enacted by a public authority that has the legitimation to issue binding norms. These norms claim compliance. Noncompliance renders a behaviour illegal and usually entails organized sanctions by the public authority.

Accordingly, a law has certain addressees, a certain scope, and a certain purpose. It is oriented towards application to concrete cases. The question is either (proactively) which behaviour is required or forbidden in a certain situation or (retroactively) whether a certain behaviour was compatible with or a violation legal norm. Different from a command, laws cover a great variety of future situations, including situations that could not be foreseen by the author of the law. Therefore, legal norms are passed in more or less general and abstract terms. This hinders their immediate application to a set of facts. The application is rather preceded by a concretization, which, in turn, requires an interpretation of the relevant norm.

The interpretation bridges the gap between the general and abstract norm and the individual and concrete case by deriving a more precise standard from the text, which can then be applied to the facts. There is no application without prior interpretation. The correct way to interpret a legal norm cannot itself be regulated by law. It is often a matter of controversy. Controversial is the goal of interpretation. Is it the intent of the author of the law or is it an impersonal objective of the law? Controversial is the question whether the context of the law matters for its interpretation. And controversial is the method of interpretation-strictly literal or purposive or even consequentialist, to name some possibilities.

Interpretation is everywhere. If the term 'dignity' appears in a constitutional text, such as in the German Basic Law, more precisely in its Bill of Rights ('Human dignity is inviolable'), the question arises to whom it is addressed. Against whom is human dignity constitutionally protected? The text itself does not answer this question. This leaves room for more than one answer. The obvious answer might be that the norm is addressed to everybody. Nobody may violate another's dignity. The widely accepted answer in Germany is, however, that all holders of public authority in Germany or all state agents are the addressees of the norm. They are bound by it. They must not violate it.

Constitutions of other countries may regulate this in a different way. In Germany this restraint follows from the fact that the Bill of Rights, of which the guarantee of human dignity forms a part, is binding for the German State only, not for other states, which have their own constitutions, and not for German citizens or the inhabitants of Germany. They are the beneficiaries of the guarantee of dignity, not its addressees. Hence, only state agents can violate the constitutional guarantee. A private person may behave in a way inconsistent with the value that is constitutionally protected in the Bill of Rights. But such a behaviour does not amount to a violation of the constitutional norm, since individuals are not bound by it.

The legal text may, however, go beyond a mere prohibition. The Basic Law, for, example, prescribes that the state has to respect and protect dignity. 'Respect' means the obligation of the state to refrain from actions that would violate someone's dignity. 'Protect' means that the state is under the additional duty to shield the beneficiaries of the guarantee from acts by third parties incompatible with their dignity. 1 But this does not change the previous statement that dignity as formulated in the German Constitution binds exclusively the state. Individuals are not bound by dignity as a constitutional norm, but they are submitted to the laws or acts that the state may issue in order to fulfill its protective duty.

If the purpose of the dignity clause of the constitution is to prevent violations of human dignity, it is necessary to know what dignity means and which acts form a violation of dignity. Again, the constitUtional text does not answer these questions. Yet this is not a peculiarity of dignity. While ordinary

<sup>1</sup> See BVerfGE 1, 97 (104) [Hinterbliebenenrente].

laws often define the notions they use, such definitions are rare within bills of rights. They name the object of protection (the press, the art, property, the home, etc.), but leave it to the applicant of the law to ascertain whether a certain object of a state action is covered by that notion or not. Vagueness does not deprive a norm of its legal nature. Vagueness has to be reduced by way of interpretation.

The orientation towards application of the law to concrete cases and the necessity to end up with a decision distinguishes legal interpretation from interpretation of other texts. The cases may present problems which the lawmaker was not aware of or could not have been aware of. This does not excuse the law applicant from making a decision. The question cannot be left open. As long as a law has not been repealed it applies, no matter whether the circumstances have changed since its enactment. Likewise, it cannot be left open which out of two or more possible interpretations is the correct one. All may have their merits; but the law applicant must choose among them and give reasons for the choice.

There may be instances in which the consensus as to what constitutes a violation of dignity is broad. Torture, although by no means uncontroversial, is an example. In other instances it may be difficult to find a consensus. Two recent cases that the German Constitutional Court had to decide may illustrate the difficulty. Does a law that permits the German Air Force to shoot down a captured plane that is directed into a target where people live or work violate the dignity of the passengers?2 Would it make a difference if only the hijackers were in the plane? Or does a certain diminution of social security benefits violate the dignity of those in need?3 Can this depend on the means that a state has at its disposal?

We discuss these questions in an interdisciplinary context: dignity is not the property of one discipline only. Before becoming a legal term it was a theological and a philosophical notion; the framers of a constitution may have been inspired by philosophy or theology. Does this mean that the meaning of dignity in a legal document may be or even has to be determined with reference to theological or philosophical works? Let us leave the practical difficulties aside, although they are serious enough: Which participant in a legislative process was influenced by which philosophical or religious theory? How were they understood? What if various tendencies were competing with each other? How can one prove influence?

<sup>2</sup> See BVerfGE 115, 118 ff. [Luftsicherheitsgesetz].

<sup>3</sup> See BVerfGE 125, 175 ff. [Hartz IV).

It seems of greater importance, though, that the notion, be it theological or philosophical by origin, is transferred into a different context if becoming part of a legal document. This transfer disconnects it from its roots, not in a way that completely changes its meaning but in a way that any inference from a theological or philosophical understanding of dignity to its legal meaning is prohibited. Rather, the legal process in which the notion was enacted, the historical experience on which the framers built or to which they reacted, the interplay of the norm with other provisions in the same legal document is decisive. It may then come close to its philosophical or theological roots, but it is the result of an autonomous legal process.

Thus, the German Constitutional Court, when expounding the notion of dignity in the Basic Law, often used language that reminds of Kant's object formula: 4 'So act that you use humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means'. 5 But the court never referred to Kant. Kant taught in the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, whereas the constitutional guarantee of human dignity was first adopted in a German constitutional text after the Second World War. In order to determine its legal impact within the Basic Law, it is more promising to ask what caused this step in 1949, 150 years after Kant Why did many other countries follow forty years later?

This leads the interpreter to the historical context. It is a source of illumination but does not bind the law applicant. Originalist theories of constitutional interpretation, according to which a legal notion has to be understood in the way the framers understood it, are absent in Germany. Here the question is less how the framers understood the term but what purpose or what function a constitutional provision that guarantees human dignity is to fulfil in a specific legal order. This leaves room for an adaptation of a legal notion to changed situations or new challenges as long as the purpose or function is not altered by the law applicant. Not every change of meaning requires a constitutional amendment.

Regarding dignity in a German constitution drafted in 1948-9 it is of importance that before the enactment the Nazi regime had committed atrocities

<sup>5</sup> Examples of the use of the object formula by the German Constitutional Court include BVerfGE 9, 89 (95) [Gehllr bei Haftbefehl]; BVerfGE 27, 1 (6) [Mikrozensus]; BVerfGE 28, 386 (391) [Kurzzeitige Freiheitsstrafe]; BVerfGE 45, 187 (228) [Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe]; BVerfGE 57, 250 (275) [V-Mann]; BVerfGE 72, 105 (116) [Lebenslange Freiheitsstrafe]; BVerfGE 96, 375 (399) [Kind als Schaden]; BVerfGE 109, 133 (149 f.)

unheard of in history, and the Basic Law's underlying motive can be summarized in the words 'Never again', meaning never again a self-destruction of democracy as in 1933, and never again a total neglect of human rights and of the recognition that every human being deserves as a part of mankind. This background may then serve as starting point in the determination of the meaning of dignity, and, as a matter of fact, the court started its explanation of 'dignity' by referring to the Nazi atrocities as the clearest examples of what the guarantee of dignity should prevent in the future. 6

But this does not mean that the application of dignity is limited to cases of repetition ofNazi atrocities. It shows, however, that in the light of historical events that had been up to then unthinkable, more was at stake than a number of liberties, something that forms the common ground of the various constitutional rights and guides their understanding. Dignity thus added something to the traditional bills of rights, for which no necessity had existed in previous constitutions written in the light of their historical context. This surplus value has to be determined, taking into account which values other provisions of the constitution entrench and what dignity adds to them. From there, analogies may be drawn to new layers of meaning.

This shows at the same time that human dignity will not necessarily have the same meaning in every legal system. In countries with a racist past, for instance, dignity, if included in the constitution, will have a strong emphasis on equal treatment. 7 Differences exist also with regard to rank and function. Dignity may be regarded as a principle that informs the interpretation and application of rights; it may be regarded as one right among others or count as a preferred right. In a country with a rudimentary bill of rights, such as Israel, the main function of the constitutional guarantee of dignity may be to fill the gaps and to generate new rights based on the argument that they are implied in the notion of dignity. 8

<sup>6</sup> In an early case regarding the prohibition of the SRP party (BVerfGE 2, 1), the Constitutional Court emphasized that the Basic Law established a constitutional order that is the opposite of the totalitarian state which rejects human dignity, liberty and equality (BVerfGE 2, 1 (12)). In another early case (BVerfGE 1, 97 (104)), the Constitutional Court said that the purpose of the human dignity provision in Article 1 Basic Law was the protection against 'Emiedrigung, Brandmarkung, Verfolgung, Achtung usw' (humiliation, stigmatization, persecution, ostracism, etc.). Later, the Constitutional Court explicitly said that this enumeration resulted from the experience of atrocities during the Nazi regime (BVerfGE 109,279 (312)).

<sup>7</sup> See Laurie W. H. Ackermann, 'Equality in the South African Constitution: the role of dignity', *Zeitschriftfoer Auslaendisches Oeffentliches Recht und Voelkerrecht* 63 (2000), 537.

<sup>8</sup> In some cases, the Israeli Supreme Court derived an equality right from the notion of human dignity: for example, HCJ 5394/92 *Hupert v Yad Vashem* 48(3) PD 353, 362 [1994]; HCJ 453/94 *Israel Women:S Networkv Government oflsrae/48(5)* PD 510 [1994].

The German Constitution starts with a guarantee of human dignity. though without impact on the legal validity, the prominent position of dignity helped the Constitutional Court to declare dignity the foundational value of the social order, a basic norm that appears behind the more concrete guarantees in the Bill of Rights, but also behind the structural and organizational provisions of the constitution such as democracy and the rule of law, yet a value that had to be made explicit after the Nazi government had departed from a shared moral consensus. The older rights then appear as more concrete expressions of the overarching idea of dignity, and have to be understood and applied in its light.

This overarching value may have had different origins and different connotations for different people, and even for different members of the constituent assembly, for some a Christian, for others a humanistic or enlightenment, for others a Marxist background. The constituent assembly as such did not decide on which tradition to build. It only decided to make dignity the foundational norm of the polity. The enactment as law neutralizes the ideological background. Thus, it would not be legitimate for the law applicant to define the meaning by adhering to one of the background theories. Consequently, inconsistency with one or another theory does not disqualify the legal reasoning · by which meaning is given to the notion.

Generally speaking, every reference to non-legal sources of understanding the legal notion of dignity or every insight from other disciplines must be translatable into a legal argument, and fit into the legal environment in which dignity appears. Thus, a concept of dignity which relies on the belief that every man is created in the image of God would conflict with the secular nature of the state, and likewise the idea that some people are more dignified than others conflicts with the egalitarian nature of the Basic Law. Of course, what counts as a legal argument and fits into a specific legal context is contested and alterable, but the contest can only be decided within the legal system, not from outside.

### Dignity as absolute right

In a legal context, rights are usually not absolute. Every right can be abused to harm others. Every right can enter into conflict with other rights or the same right of others. This is why, in a legal context, the question oflimits or restrictions of rights plays an important role. Most constitutions contain limitation clauses. But the necessity of imposing limits on rights is independent of a specific permission in the constitution. Also, under a constitution that gives the legislature or executive no express permission to limit rights, like the US Constitution, limitations are inevitable. It becomes a matter of interpretation to determine legitimate limits and distinguish them from illegitimate ones.

The most important questions that arise in connection with the limitation of rights are as follows. Who is entitled to impose limits on the use of rights? For which purposes may limits be imposed? Which circumstances allow the limitation of rights? What means are appropriate to limit rights? How far may limitations go in restricting the use of a right? Are there limits oflimitation? Is there a hierarchy of rights that helps to decide a conflict among various rights? How can one balance different rights? These are questions with which courts, especially courts with constitutional jurisdiction, are constantly concerned when they adjudicate in the field of constitutional rights.

In Germany, dignity is exempted from considerations like these. Dignity is regarded as an absolute right. 9 This preferred position is mainly based on a textual argument. Article 1 section 1 sentence 1 of the Basic Law declares that human dignity is *'unantastbar'.* This term is commonly translated as 'inviolable' *('unverletzlich').* Yet *unverletzlich* appears several times in connection with fundamental rights whereas *unantastbar* is used only in connection with dignity. The rights which are called 'inviolable' can nevertheless be limited by law. *Unantastbar* is stronger than *unverletzlich.* This difference gave rise to the interpretation of dignity as being absolutely guaranteed.

No other right in the Basic Law enjoys absolute protection. It may be that some rights are regarded as more important or more fundamental than others. In the jurisprudence of the German Constitutional Court one can find language that privileges the right to life. In the First Abortion Decision, the court writes: 'It does not require any further explanation that human life is among the highest values of the constitutional order of the Basic Law; it is the vital basis of human dignity and it is the prerequisite of all other fundamental rights. ' 10 Yet, in spite of this assertion, the court denies that there is a hierarchy among fundamental rights, and even this right is not protected absolutely. It has a limitation clause.

What distinguishes an absolute right from relative rights? The difference lies in the extent of protection. Constitutional protection of a right does not mean that it is immunized from any restriction. It only means that restrictions need a constitutional justification. The protection of a right is usually but a

<sup>9</sup> See BVerfGE 75, 369 (380) [StrauB-Karikatur]; BVerfDE 93, 266 (293) ['So1daten sind Marder'], BVerfGE 109, 279 (312 f.) [GroBer Lauschangriff].

<sup>10</sup> BVerfGE 39, 1 ( 42): 'Das mensch1iche Leben stellt, wie nicht naher begriindet werden muB, innerha1b der grundgesetz1ichen Ordnung einen Hochstwert dar; es ist die vita1e Basis der Menschenwiirde und die Voraussetzung aller anderen Grundrechte.'

relative one. There may be good reasons for restrictions. 'Absolute' means, to the contrary, that no restriction is permitted. Hence, different from all other rights, dignity is neither subject to limitation nor to balancing. This entails a different treatment of dignity compared with other fundamental rights. They may be limited under certain conditions, or have to give way to another right in the case at hand.

Therefore, the application of fundamental rights to concrete cases follows a two tiered approach. It is first examined whether the right was negatively affected by some state action (or omission). This presupposes a determination of the scope of the right and a qualification of the state action as infringement. Second, it is examined whether the infringement was justified according to the limitation clause of that right and (usually) the principle of proportionality. Lorraine Weinrib describes this approach as the post-war paradigm of fundamental rights jurisprudence, 11 originally developed by the German Constitutional Court and later adopted almost universally, albeit with the exception of the USA. 12

If a right is regarded as absolute, the two tier approach does not apply. Every infringement is a violation. The question of justification does not arise. No intrusion, no limitation can be justified if dignity is at stake. The same is true for balancing. The balancing procedure, which applies if two constitutionally protected rights, goods, or interests enter into collision, implies that, depending on the circumstances that have to be taken into account, at times one right and at times the other right prevails. Dignity as an absolute right always trumps. If dignity is involved in a collision with another constitutionally protected right, good, or interest, no balancing takes place. The result is clear from the outset.

The decision to recognize a right as absolutely protected has some consequences that follow logically from the absoluteness. The first consequence is that not more than one right within a constitution can be treated as absolute. Only then is it possible that this right always trumps. If two or more rights are regarded as absolute and they enter into conflict (which cannot be excluded), one of them has to give way, which means that it is not absolute. If several rights are to enjoy a special protection, they may be treated as preferred rights, meaning that they will usually prevail in <;ase of conflict, yet not

<sup>11</sup> Lorraine Weinrib, 'The postwar paradigm and American exceptionalism', in Sujit Choudhry ( ed.), *The Migration of Constitutional Ideas* (New York, Cambridge University Press, 2006), 83, at 93. In some countries, such as Canada, Israel, and South Africa, the infringement is called 'violation', although only the second step shows whether the infringement was a violation.

<sup>12</sup> For the USA see, for example, Michael J. Meyer and William A. Parent ( eds ), *The Constitution of Rights. Human Dignity and American Values* (Ithaca, NY, Cornell University Press, 1992).

always. Dignity, under German constitutional law, is not a preferred right, it is an absolute right.

The second consequence is that dignity, if understood as an absolute right, cannot have a broad scope. The German Constitutional Court concedes all fundamental rights a rather broad scope. This can easily be done because these rights are subject to limitation. The first step of the two tier approach only opens the door for the constitutional evaluation of whether a limitation or an infringement was justified. One can therefore be generous on the first step. In the case of an absolute right, the infringement is identical with a violation. As a consequence, the scope of an absolute right must be narrowly defined in order to prevent unacceptable results. The narrow scope is the price of the elevation to an absolute rank.

The necessity of a narrow scope follows also from the fact that dignity as an absolute right stops any political discussion. If a politically desirable measure affects human dignity, the need for it may be as pressing as possible; the measure has no chance of being employed. Not even a constitutional amendment would help, since the so-called eternity clause of the Germany's Constitution (Article 79, section 3) immunizes dignity from change. Dignity is, therefore, a most effective weapon in a political struggle, and many try to bring their rejection or their approval of certain political plans under the umbrella of dignity, currently mainly in the field of reproductive rights and bioethical questions.

Consequently, dignity is frequently invoked before the Constitutional Court, but the court rarely found that a law or an act violated Article 1. The court has to think twice before it includes a certain aspect of personhood into the scope of Article 1 because the inclusion predetermines the result of the legal scrutiny. If the aspect enjoys the protection of dignity no limitation can be justified. This is, for instance, important regarding the relationship between dignity and the right to life. According to Article 2, section 2, sentence 1 of the Basic Law everybody has the right to life. But according to section 2, this right can be limited. The Basic Law recognizes that there are certain situations where the state may lawfully take someone's life.

This can only mean that taking someone's life does not per se violate the person's dignity; otherwise the constitution would contradict itself. There may, however, be instances where life is taken in a way that affects the person's dignity. The Constitutional Court assumed this, for example, in the First Abortion Decision13 and recently in the Aviation Security Case14 with regard

<sup>13</sup> BVerfGE 39, I (42 f.) [Schwangerschaftsabbruch I].

<sup>14</sup> BVerfGE 115, 118 (!52 f.) [Luftsicherheitsgesetz].

to the innocent passengers and crew members, not with respect to the terrorists. In the court's view, the passengers and the crew members were treated as mere objects, whereas the terrorists only bore the consequences of their free decision to kill innocent people in order to promote their political interests.

The impact of human dignity is therefore reserved for gross assaults on humanity, which fortunately remain rare in the Federal Republic. Does this mean that dignity enjoys an extremely high rank but is of little practical impact? This might be so if all the minor impairments of liberty and equality were constitutionally irrelevant. But this is not the case. They are treated under the various constitutional rights that render broad, though not absolute, protection. In addition, the legal impact of dignity is not limited to direct application in cases of presumed violations. Dignity as the highest value of the constitutional order also has indirect effects when other provisions of the constitution are interpreted and applied.

Other than the relatively small number of cases where dignity appeared as the foremost criterion of the judgment, the cases in which dignity is used to inform the interpretation of other rights are quite numerous. The constitutional norm on which the decision is based is then formed by a combination ofthe right at stake and dignity ('in conjunction with'). Here, Article 1 usually extends the scope of the right or deepens its impact when it comes to balancing. The combined criteria seem to be a speciality of German constitutional doctrine. The combination of the dignity clause in the constitution with another fundamental right has often led to important changes in the law.

The combination of dignity and a more concrete basic right is not limited to certain rights. Every right has a dignity core, and this can become relevant when principle of proportionality is applied. The closer the restriction of a right comes to its dignity core the higher the of the right in the balancing process. However, dignity is never on the side of one right only. An illustrative case is the frequent conflict between freedom of speech on the one hand and personal honour (as part of everybody's right to free development of his or her personality) onthe other. Here, dignity does not only strengthen the honour side, as some legal scholars would have it, but also the freedom of speech side.

A third and last consequence of the absolute character of Article 1 is that dignity can only protect a person against being treated in a way that is contrary to his or her dignity. It cannot protect activities of a person. Any activity, any behaviour may cause harm to others or endanger importiirit communal goods. If dignity as absolute right were to protect activities, it would be impossible to prevent or cure the harm, because this would require the limitation of the exercise of the right to dignity, which means that it could no longer be absolute. The protection of activities of a person is therefore left to the more concrete rights, which are, however, subject to limitation and balancing.

Whether it is advisable to endow one right, dignity, with the legal quality of an absolute right, and to pay the price in the form of a narrow scope seems debatable. There is no universally valid answer to this question. As mentioned before, the historical experience that created a demand for an absolute barrier to government plays an important role. Countries without experiences of that sort may see no need to establish an absolute right. The fact that such a right must be construed narrowly seems acceptable the more all important aspects of humanity have found protection in other fundamental rights, and perhaps even in a residual right that protects the individual against threats unknown when the constitution was framed.
