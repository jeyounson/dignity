# **Which Dignity? Which Religious Freedom?**

#### *Patrick Riordan*

There are two levels of debate about dignity, especially as it is used to ground religious liberty. One level of debate concerns the ways in which legislation on rights appeals to dignity, and how lawyers draw on those legal resources for the resolution of cases. There is another more foundational level of debate grounding the concept of dignity in some anthropological, historical, philosophical, theological, or ontological account. This chapter engages in one such debate about how the concept of dignity used to ground religious liberty is itself conceptualized. Ronald Dworkin's redefinition of religious freedom, based on his particular understanding of human dignity, situates the debate (section one). Developing jurisprudence is following the track mapped out by Dworkin. Here the emphasis is on dignity as rooted in autonomy, and consequently religious freedom is valued as the exercise of autonomy. But if this is its value, does religious freedom require separate mention apart from other freedoms? Can more be said to comprehend human dignity? Possible answers relying on a more ontological account, drawing on Martha Nussbaum's invoking of Stoic philosophy in recounting the history of religious liberty in the USA, would have to be secured against challenges of essentialism, and the suspicion of disvaluing autonomy (section two). At the same time the phenomenology of religious experience suggests that religion is not adequately understood as a choice. Because of its foundational nature and the architectonic role it plays in people's and societies' lives, religion poses particular challenges for social order. Hence there are good grounds for fostering a distinctive understanding of religious liberty which does not reduce it to autonomy (section three). While the notion of religion as it arises in current jurisprudence is strongly coloured by the emphasis on autonomy, the recovery of a more ontological grounding for dignity may not require any change in the law as such, because of the law's distinctive purposes, but it could foster a richer public culture and political debate.

#### Dignity and liberty

What is the relationship between the dignity of the human person and the right to religious liberty? Dworkin challenges the view that religious liberty is in some way special. He bases his argument on the role played by dignity in grounding the claim to religious liberty. He asserts that 'For us, now, dignity provides the only available justification for freedom of religious thought and practice.' 1 Dworkin interprets dignity in terms of two principles of (a) self-respect and (b) authenticity. Self-respect is the requirement that each one takes his own life seriously.2 Authenticity is the responsibility to shape one's life according to self-chosen standards.3 From this basic conception of human dignity, Dworkin clarifies first the difference between ethics and morality, and second the political and legal implications of his stance. Ethics is interpreted as the concern with the quality of one's own life, what one owes to oneself in terms of self-respect and authenticity. Morality is the concern with what is owed to others, but for Dworkin, significantly, what is owed to others must be decided collectively within a political community.4 Ethics and morality are linked: morality-what we owe to others-is essential to living well-what we owe to ourselves.5

Dignity requires independence. The principle of authenticity in particular requires that people should have a role in the decisions about how their behaviour is to be regulated. Each citizen would want the dignity of equal participation so that each one is given respect on an equal basis. 6 Autonomy is critical for authenticity, and so it is jeopardized by usurpation, when others' judgements about the goals and values of life replace one's own. Hence the importance ofliberty. This liberty must be respected by a political community whose legitimacy is grounded in the equal care and respect due to persons.

Religious liberty is to be respected because the political community owes respect (including non-interference in the scope of autonomous action) to the independence of persons who take control of their own lives. Freedom of religion is conftated with freedom of conscience, freedom of thought and belief, and freedom of assembly. Dworkin links the freedom of religion to what he

calls 'other foundational ethical choices-about reproduction, marriage, and sexual orientation, for instance'. 7 Since religious liberty is derived from the more general right to ethical independence, religion is to be seen as only one of many life-shaping commitments that people are in a position to make, and their dignity, their self-respect in taking responsibility for their decisions, is no different from one kind of life-shaping option to another.

Dworkin's evaporation of religious liberty by conflating it with liberty of conscience is an increasingly popular position among philosophers of law. This involves a significant realignment of the freedom of religion, raising the question ofwhy it would deserve special mention in the First Amendment to the US Constitution and in many charters and codes of human rights. Is there more to human dignity than what Dworkin's account explains? And is there something distinctive about religion which makes it more than an example of another category of event, namely life-shaping choice?

Dworkin's position finds support in a surprising quarter. Charles Taylor, writing with Jocelyn Maclure in a recent work on secularism and freedom of conscience, downplays the distinction between religious beliefs and convictions of conscience. 8 They write with approval of the growing tendency of the US and Canadian courts to treat all sincerely held convictions as deserving of respect, whether religious or secular in nature. And they also recognize the similarity of their stance to that taken by Dworkin in an earlier publication.9

Taylor and Maclure note how the understanding of religious liberty being developed by the courts tends in the direction of the individualization (or Protestantization) of religion. 10 Their own account of religious liberty exhibits the same individualizing tendency. Their argument frequently includes a remark to the effect that religious beliefs and world-views are *chosen,* and to that extent they are seen as similar to other life-carrying beliefs. 11 In suggesting that 'public institutions and policies must be guided by the ideal of a society in which all individuals have an equal opportunity to choose their life plan and to implement it', they once again take for granted that life-plans are chosen.

Roger Trigg comments on some of the same cases discussed by Taylor and Maclure, but with a different emphasis. Trigg notes the same dynamic of individualization of religion and the concentration on the psychological

stance of the believer, but he regrets the development because of its consequence ofundermining the status of religious liberty in contrast to the respect given to equality. In the ongoing political movement to secure equality by eliminating discrimination, religious liberty is being interpreted in such a way that when the values conflict, liberty must always be compromised in favour of equality. The reluctance of courts on both sides of the Atlantic to make reasonable accommodation for exceptions on religious grounds entails the risk of discriminating against the religious side in such cases. 12

Trigg draws attention to instances in which judges have taken it upon themselves to decide what is to count as religion. Judges in difficult cases have been reluctant in general to enter into theological debates about what constitutes religion, or true religion, and have tended to concentrate instead on the subjective stance of the plaintiff. In some such cases, sincerity in holding a belief is sufficient for the belief to count as religious. Trigg comments on one Canadian judgment in which 'a personal or subjective conception of religion, one that is integrally linked with an individual's self-definition and fulfilment, and is a function of personal autonomy and choice', is explicitly espoused in the judgment given. 13 Trigg notes how the judgment undermines any idea of a communal religion, so that it is not the shared belief and practice of some community which is under review but the sincerely held attitudes of an individual person. He sees this as particularly risky. If any belief is to be deemed religious simply on account of the sincerity with which it is held, then it becomes impossible to distinguish religious from other sincerely held opinions, and the freedom of religion is emptied of content. North American courts take a great risk in deciding to understand religion along these lines, but similar dangers are noted also in European and UK court judgments. 14

These discussions are surveyed here, not to advocate one or other resolution of the cases mentioned, or even to generalize on how religious liberty should be protected in law. Instead, the point is to illustrate how a particular conception of dignity as linked to autonomy is operative in the developing legal understanding of religious freedom. A comparison with the related case of exemption on religious grounds from military service is revealing. Conscientious objection to military service or to engagement in fighting wars has achieved legal protection in the UK, the USA, and in many other jurisdictions. Formerly, objectors had no protection in law but faced prosecution for their failure in civic duty. Gradually, legislators provided protection allowing for

exemption, but originally on religious grounds only. In the course of time, the grounds for exemption were extended to include such reasons which performed in the lives of dissenters the same function which religious belief performed in the lives ofbelievers. The right now accessible for all was originally won for all by religiously motivated people. Interestingly, the courts provided the extension of the exemption by acknowledging that religious belief functioned in a distinctive way in the lives of religious believers. By analogy with that distinctive function of religious belief, they acknowledged that ethical and humanist ideas could perform a similar function in the lives of those who espoused them. 15 The direction of development was clear. What is noticeable now in the arguments from Dworkin and others is that the direction of analogy is reversed: religious belief is to be understood by comparison with the role of life-shaping choices in the life of anyone. And so the question arises: would the judges who first drew the analogy accept the reversal of its direction, or would they consider that something essential had been overlooked? Is the role of religious belief in the life of a believer, as they had understood it, just the same as any life-shaping choice, or is there something distinctive to which they drew attention?

# A broader understanding of dignity

How are we best to understand the relationship between human dignity and religious liberty? Martha Nussbaum's 2008 study, *Liberty of Conscience,* illustrates some of the positions and resources for this question as played out in the USA. 16 The non-establishment clause in the First Amendment to the Constitution has required the US political community from its origins to be explicit about the relationship of the state and its law to Churches and faith groups. The demands of a pluralist society require that the state not endorse the particular metaphysical or theological commitments of any one faith or Church. On what grounds, then, might it affirm a distinctive freedom of religion, irreducible to other freedoms, without violating this requirement?

<sup>15</sup> The decisive case was in 1965, *United States v Seeger,* in which the Supreme Court ruled that the words 'religious training and belief' must be interpreted to mean 'any sincere and meaningful belief which occupies in the life of its possessor a place parallel to that filled by the God of those qualifying for exemption'. Interestingly, the Military Selective Services Act (1940), which originally allowed for conscientious objection on religious grounds, explicitly ruled out such an interpretation: 'the term "religious training and belief' does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or a merely personal moral code' (Section 6(j)).

<sup>16</sup> Martha Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience. In Defense of Americas Tradition of Religious Equality*  (New York, Basic Books, 2008).

#### 426 *Patrick Riordan*

Nussbaum makes the case that the strong evaluation of religious freedom among the US founder generation had two prominent sources. On the one hand, she discerns the influence of Stoic philosophy with its account of human nature. On the other hand, there is the Protestant Christian emphasis on conscience. These are not presented in her study as separate sources, since she identifies Stoic influence on the Christian Roger Williams, whose thought on the dignity of conscience influenced the language of the tradition.

Nussbaum finds a Stoic background to the fundamental ideas of the equal worth and dignity of human beings which permeated the debates at the time of the revolution in the USA. In that Stoic background, the notion of equal worth and dignity was explained in terms of a divine spark in each human being, evident in the human ability to distinguish right and wrong, and to form ethical judgements. This capacity found in everyone was deemed worthy of respect, and indeed reverence. 17 The required respect was to allow liberty, and to protect it against subjection to the arbitrary will of another. Hierarchy of any kind would allow some to dominate others, violating the dignity of the subjected persons, who would be no longer free to follow their own judgement. It is worth emphasizing the Stoic focus on capacity for judgement.

Nussbaum identifies 'world citizenship', or cosmopolitanism, as a second important Stoic idea at the heart of the dignity of human beings. The communality in possessing the capacity for ethical judgement links human beings in ethical responsibility, and the duties that arise from it transcend the divisions of people into different groups and parties, and even nations. Nussbaum argues that such awareness of a communality in a shared human nature freed the revolutionary generation from the assumption that a political community required the unifying force of a shared religion. 18 The young nation could not appeal to common ancestry, or ethnic identity, to allegiance to the land or to a shared religion, to find its common ground. That was provided, according to Nussbaum, by the shared conviction that people were united by the bonds of ethical obligation, rooted in the equal dignity of all as sharing a human nature.

These Stoic ideas were wedded to a distinctively Christian idea in the Protestant tradition, namely the dignity of individual conscience. Williams, the founder of the colony of Rhode Island, and the author of its charter, is taken by Nussbaum as the pre-eminent spokesman for religious liberty rooted in respect for the dignity of conscience. Rhode Island's charter in its various editions, renewed by King Charles II following the Restoration, ensured religious liberty in a manner which was recognized at the time as a radical

<sup>17</sup> Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience,* 78-9.

<sup>18</sup> Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience,* 82-3.

innovation. 19 Williams had fled persecution in Massachusetts and attempted in Rhode Island the construction of a form of public and common life which would not rely on persecution of dissidents. In his voluminous writings against persecution and in favour of religious liberty he debated with John Cotton of Massachusetts, who had defended the need to enforce orthodoxy. In surveying this debate, Nussbaum highlights two of Cotton's contentions which Williams had to counter. The first was the widely held view that people could not live at peace with one another unless they shared fundamental religious beliefs. This was the operative assumption in the resolutions of the Treaty of Westphalia (1648). Cotton's second argument was concerned with the required virtues of public officials: they would have to be morally upright to be trusted with public responsibility.2° For these two reasons, Cotton was prepared to persecute those who by adherence to dissident views jeopardized the harmony of the community. He defended religious persecution as necessary for public order, and to cut away the diseased part of the community which was likely to infect the healthy remainder. In English publications in 1644 and 1653, Williams attacked this willingness to persecute as a 'bloody tenet', and established a different practice in Rhode Island, based on respect for conscience. On the required goodness of public officials, Williams distinguished different forms of goodness, and he denied that the civil integrity of public officials required of them a religious virtue.

Nussbaum argues convincingly that Williams, writing in the mid-seventeenth century, anticipates many of the arguments which Locke will make in his letters on Toleration forty years later. She also underlines the point that the kind of respect for conscience which Williams advocates is not based on scepticism about the capacity of human reason to attain the truth. Williams did not evade the dilemma posed for those who were convinced of the truth of their own convictions, and the error of others' views: how are their views to be respected when they are believed to be false? Nussbaum comments that what Williams emphasizes is not so much the ability to find the truth, although this is not denied, but the sincere quest for that truth.21

> The idea that we are all solitary travellers, searching for light in a dark wilderness, led to the thought that this search, this striving of conscience, is what is more precious about the journey of human life-and that each person-Protestant, Catholic, Jew, Muslim, or pagan-must be permitted to conduct

<sup>21</sup> Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience,* 52.

it in his or her own way, without interference either from the state or from orthodox religion.22

The argument, neatly summarized in this sentence, is for effective recognition of liberty of conscience, which is worthy of respect because of the significance of the search for truth in anyone's life. It is noticeable how intellectualist is the interpretation of religious conviction, in contrast to the current emphasis on choice. In emphasizing the sincere quest for meaning, Nussbaum is not denying the possibility of finding true answers. But the dignity of conscience is not dependent on its success. This search for meaning which lends intelligibility and a narrative structure to life is the reason why liberty must be fostered, not so much because the exercise of autonomy is fundamental to the living of a dignified life but because no meaning or set of beliefs can serve the relevant function unless it is grasped and affirmed by people themselves. The act of comprehension is primarily an act of reason and only secondarily an act of will. At stake is the search for an adequate meaning which can comprehend all of life; for the sake of this search, and for the implementation of its results in the living of a life, freedom must be protected. In this sense, Nussbaum's promotion of respect for autonomy is different. On her account, autonomy is not the basic value, but instead serves the more ultimate end of the answers which articulate the truth about the reality of human existence.

Nussbaum's lengthy study offers a distinctive account of religious liberty and its relation to dignity, which is significantly different to Dworkin's account. The valuing of conscience and the human moral capacity as marking out human dignity is open to an ontological account, especially because of the connection to Stoicism. The question of human nature, of the nature of conscience, and those moral powers which deserve respect is raised by this approach. The possibility that something distinctive about the freedom of religion can emerge from such exploration is left open.

Nussbaum notes the orientation of conscience to the truth, so that the kind of toleration which is aimed at in the tradition of religious freedom in her view does not depend on scepticism about the capacities or accomplishments of conscience. Instead, the constitutional tradition cautiously maintains a distance lest the state unwittingly endorse content which conscience should embrace only freely. The emphasis is again on content, more than on the freedom to pursue or embrace that content. this emphasis, it would be difficult to make sense of the very strong endorsement which Nussbaum gives to a stance taken by Jacques Maritain, in which the ground- for toleration is not scepticism but love of truth and respect for human intellect and conscience as

capable of attaining truth. Maritain distinguishes different kinds of tolerance, and concludes in a passage which Nussbaum cites twice in full, both at the beginning and at the end of her study:

> There is a real and genuine tolerance only when a man is firmly and absolutely convinced of a truth, or of what he holds to be a truth, and when he at the same time recognises the right of those who deny this truth to exist, and to contradict him, and to speak their own mind, not because they are free from truth but because they seek truth in their own way, and because he respects in them human nature and human dignity and those very resources and living springs of the intellect and of conscience which make them potentially capable of attaining the truth he loves.23

### Rethinking dignity and religion

Nussbaum's study provides pointers for the two key questions: what more needs to be said to comprehend human dignity, and what is distinctive about religious freedom. On the first question, an ontological account of human nature can complement the practical account of dignity proposed by Dworkin. On the second question, closer attention to the phenomenology of religion and to its social history provides reasons for considering religion to be different. Religious faith is not a choice like other choices, and it is of such significance in social life that it warrants particular attention.

Dworkin's interpretation of dignity is evidently one-sided. Dignity is rooted in the kind of being the human is, but the description of that kind of being is foreshortened to concentrate simply on the capacity of each one to take responsibility for themselves. Nussbaum's study of the American case revealed an alternative emphasis, on the human capacity for judgement. A more extensive account of human nature would expand this basis. A comparison of humanity with other kinds of animate and inanimate beings-the traditional approach of an Aristotelian ontology-can provide perspectives in which the broader grounds of human dignity can appear. Several debates reflected in the contributions to this volume can be read as exploring these grounds. David Walsh's reflections on the encounter with human reality for which he uses the language of epiphany raise questions of ontological grounding, as does Clemens Sedmak's appeal to interiority and to mystery. Simi-

<sup>23</sup> Quoted from Jacques Maritain, 'Truth and human fellowship', in Maritain, *On the Use of Philosophy: Three Essays* (Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1961), and Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience,* 23, and 333.

larly, in a theological context James Hanvey points out the need for a more ontological account of the *imago Dei.* 

This task of providing an ontological account to substantiate the claims of human dignity will not be completed here. Indeed, many doubt whether it could be completed at all. The spectre of essentialism is raised, not least by moral theologians who criticize a type of physicalism used to generate detailed moral norms. While the dangers of distortion are very properly noted, the risks should not result in a refusal to engage with the questions raised. Nussbaum herself attempts to defend a form of essentialism which she calls 'Aristotelian Essentialism', while rigorously avoiding the associated dangers.24 Another area of debate in which the notion of a human nature has been controversial, but has also been found to be indispensable, is the analytic philosophical reconstruction of Karl Marx's thought. While Marx himself and most Marxists avoided any discussion of human nature, even to the point of denying that there is any such thing, leading analytic interpreters of Marx point to the necessity of a conception of human nature in which some fundamental constants are recognized. For instance, G. A. Cohen, while noting that Marxists traditionally deny that there is a historically invariant human nature; affirms some facts of experience which provide him with sufficient basis to sketch an outline of a conception of human nature.25 Other contributors to the analysis of Marx's thought defend their understanding of his account of human nature, while acknowledging how controversial this project is among Marxists.26 In a theological context, Bernard Lonergan offers a reconstruction of traditional notions of human nature, while retaining the perspectives of historical mindednessY From these discussions, it is evident that the dangers associate& with the provision of an account of human nature are well recognized but that they are insufficient to block the effort. For an adequate understanding of human dignity, ontological questions about human nature should not be excluded. If pursued in the Aristotelian tradition, which is by no means the only relevant philosophical tradition for this project, they would note that humans are animals, but qmilified with the adjective rational. For instance,

<sup>24</sup> Martha C. Nussbaum, 'Human functioning and social justice: in defence of Aristotelian Essentialism', *Political Theory* 20.2 ( 1992), 202-46. A similar argument is made when she attempts to defend a 'thick' account of the human good which avoids the threatening dangers by remaining 'vague'. See Martha Nussbaum, 'Aristotelian social democracy', in R. Douglass, M. Bruce, M. Gerald and H. S. Richardson ( eds ), *Liberalism and the Good* (New York, Routledge, 1990). -

Aristotle's remark in his *Politics* that it is the capacity for reasoned speech which makes humans political animals does not deny the fact that many other gregarious animals rely on voice to communicate. We humans are of such kind that we rely on reason for a good functioning social order. This capacity for reason and for the purposeful ordering of our lives according to what we know and believe is what distinguishes us from the animals. This notion of humans distinguished from other animals, though animals themselves, is the idea of human dignity.28 On this account, then, the aspect of human dignity of particular relevance to religious liberty is the human capacity to enquire, to wonder, to seek to understand. It is not only in being a certain kind of animal, a rational one, that the dignity of humans on the ladder of being consists; it lies also in possessing an openness to the most ultimate and comprehensive explanation of reality, whatever it turns out to be. This too constitutes an essential element of human dignity.

Beyond these suggestions for an alternative grounding of human dignity, following Nussbaum's Stoic account, the question remains concerning the distinctiveness of freedom of religion, and why it might merit separate mention alongside other freedoms. The stoic account emphasized conscience, one's capacity for and exercise of moral judgement. Aristotelians would expand this to include the capacity to enquire about ultimate causes and reasons, and to order one's life according to what one comes to know. They fulfil an architectonic function in human life. Dworkin had emphasized the life-shaping feature of choice, and so this architectonic function alone will not serve to distinguish religious liberty as warranting distinctive protection. Another feature of his description was to characterize religious faith as a matter of choice. Maclure and Taylor also seemed to support such a view. But is religious faith properly or adequately labelled an act of choice? The phenomenology of religious faith suggests that the believer is more likely to feel chosen, or called, than to consider herself as selecting a way of life which seems attractive for some reason. Insofar as it is experienced as obedience to God's will, submission to the divine command, which is a common feature in the three monotheistic world religions, it is not primarily experienced as choice but as response. And as response, it is likely to be expressed in terms of necessity, as when the analogy is drawn with falling in love. Alvin Plantinga attempts to provide a reflective account of this aspect by referring to it as properly basic: it is that

28 It is fascinating to note how this idea, though linked to Greek philosophy, is included in the Hebrew literature, for instance in Psalm 8, but also in other passages such as the Genesis stories of creation.

which grounds other decisions and commitments rather than a choice which might be explained in terms of prior preferences or interests.29

Finally, consideration of the actual history of the First Amendment to the US Constitution or indeed the history of codes of human rights, points to the elements of experience which led the drafters to see in religious liberty a distinctive ground for recognition and protection beyond the general recognition and protection for liberties of conscience, speech, and assembly. 30 The drafters of the Constitution and its First Amendment recognized that religion posed a distinctive problem for the political community. The experience of persecution and enforcement of orthodoxy both in England and in the colonies of Massachusetts and Connecticut, Cotton's bloody tenet, reminded them that such practice is always a temptation for those who hope to achieve good by the use of state power. And so they chose to ensure two things in relation to religious freedom which perhaps did not require explicit mention in relation to other freedoms. First of all, it was necessary to ensure that the state did not trespass in an area of life in which it had no competence, namely religion, and that it did not favour the views and convictions of any particular group. Note how here again the issue is intellectualist rather than voluntarist: the state should not endorse views and convictions that are beyond its capacities to judge. At the same time, it was necessary to ensure that no religion or Church, no matter how well supported by the electorate, could assume the powers of the state by means of establishment, and thereby impose its doctrines and practices on others. That these were real possibilities was evident to the framers, who did not see similar dangers with other kinds of belief or practices.

Non-establishment is not simply a restriction on what the state may do, it is also a restriction on what any religion may aspire to. It may not seek or attain endorsement by the powers of the state. The non-establishment provision underlines the distinctiveness of religious freedom and marks it off from other freedoms of belief and conscience. The legislators have not seen the need to warn Congress against endorsing with state authority the views of any groups with firm convictions concerning, the econ,omy, the protection oftlie environment, scientific exploration of nature, or other fundamental values. They recognized something which distinguished religion from these other matters of personal commitment and belief. However that distinctiveness might be described, at least they recognized that there were significant dangers for public life associated with it, against which they saw the need for protection.

# Conclusion

This chapter distinguished two levels of debate, and attempted a discussion on one level. It resisted an interpretation of human dignity which privileged autonomy, an interpretation which is quite at home within the other level of debate. From within the parameters of its own discipline, the law in liberal democratic polities must privilege autonomy. The freedom of individuals to pursue their own good as they judge it to be is highly respected, and the law takes great care not to infringe on that sphere of freedom unnecessarily. This would be a danger in any instance in which the law would appear to enter into deliberations of people concerning their own good. Their own good they must judge for themselves, within appropriate limits. Those limits include the preservation of such a regime of legislation and adjudication which protects autonomy. Some such goods are to be upheld by the rule oflaw. When questions of human goods arise, therefore, it is not surprising that the legal perspective tends to bracket those questions and to treat them all together under the rubric of autonomy. Whatever the debates may be about the goods in question, the law concentrates its attention on the autonomy secured for individuals to identify and pursue their own good. It may seem, then, that all the relevant goods are protected indirectly, in protecting the freedoms of people to identify and to pursue their good.

This, of course, is an extreme simplification, but it may have some validity as identifying a spontaneous inclination of the legal perspective. It may explain the tendency to interpret Nussbaum's discussion of liberty of conscience as rooting the freedom in question in the good of autonomy. In fact, as argued above, her discussion suggests a more intellectualist interpretation. This discussion entails no need for a change in the attitude of the law towards freedom of conscience: it is autonomy which is to be respected by the law. But in the context of other discussions, those of philosophy and the political debate about the goods to be valued and pursued in common life, autonomy is not the only or the ultimate good. Where the perspective of the law colonizes the philosophical and political debates, the predominance of autonomy can seem to silence other perspectives. This is the danger with Dworkin's discussion of human dignity. The liberal philosophical tradition's focus on autonomy, reinforced by its alliance with a liberal legal perspective, can envisage only one possible candidate as a philosophical ground of human dignity.

What difference would it if grounds other than autonomy were accepted for human dignity? What kind of difference would qualify as relevant in such a question and its answer? Perhaps those alternative grounds would entail no significant change in the practices of the law: it should

#### 434 *Patrick Riordan*

continue to guarantee protection for liberty and the autonomy of human subjects. But alternative grounds might well entail significant differences in other realms of common life, as in the shared understandings which sustain the public sphere and the political debates in which our polities pursue the ongoing concerns about the quality of our common life. Our resources for discussing the common good may well be handicapped by an inability to consider dimensions of the human good which are not adequately articulated in the notion of autonomy and the freedom secured for individuals to identify and pursue their own good. The quality of public discourse requires literacy and mastery of meaning and argument beyond those required within the discipline of the law.

In conclusion, it is argued that there is a dynamic of constriction in the meaning of religious liberty in present debates, and that this follows from a restrictive reading of dignity. The debates are not only academic (Dworkin) but also in the practice of courts (Taylor and Maclure, Trigg). The restrictive readings can be challenged, following Nussbaum's account of the history of religious liberty in the USA, relying on an ontological grounding of dignity, and a more phenomenologically grounded understanding of religion.
