# **Dignity and Disgrace: Moral Citizenship and Constitutional Protection**

# Introduction and summary: explaining the role of dignity

WHY HAS DIGNITY TAKEN such a central place in South Africa's constitutional jurisprudence? And what does it tell us about the fact that South Africa's Constitution was the first anywhere that expressly outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation, and one of the first to extend equal rights to marry to lesbian and gay couples? The puzzle is worth unravelling.

On a visit to the Constitutional Court of South Africa in February 2010, Professor Catharine MacKinnon, who described herself as the pioneer of the 'substantive equality' approach to rights, forcefully expressed her bemusement that the court's equality jurisprudence centred on the right to dignity.2 MacKinnon has recognized that 'deprivation of dignity is often a powerful dimension of the substance of inequality and does some of its work'. But she has also asserted that ascribing dignity to humans, particularly when employed in the Kantian sense of their unconditional and incomparable worth,3 is simply inadequate to address certain social practices or relationships that undermine it, or instances where individuals willingly relinquish it.4

Yet there is sound reason why dignity, for all its indeterminacy, has taken so central a place in the formative jurisprudence of the court. It is to be found in South Africa's past of racial indignity-where racial subordination was both premised on and itself enacted shamefulness and disgrace. Apartheid laws deprived black South Africans of their citizenship, gave them education that was inferior to whites', segregated and confined them on land both urban and rural, and relegated them to poorer jobs and economic roles.

But those laws represented, and did, more. They derived from the view that black South Africans were subordinate and inferior humans, and treated them accordingly. They enunciated and practised the condition of 'non-whiteness' as legally shameful. I grew up in apartheid South Africa in a desperately poor and fractured white family. But I was glad not to be black. At home, at school, and on the street, my daily consciousness was imbued with a sense and gratitude that, at least, I was white. The shame of being black, not only with the legal impediments and subordinations that marked it, but with the stigmatized condition those impediments implied, was not mine. My humanness was superior: unshamefully white. 5

In this way, apartheid laws damaged both white and black, by stigmatizing black people, placing a mark of shame on their race, and by injuring white people with a false conception of superiority. 6 This legacy re-emerges vividly in persisting, acrid controversy about race in South African society. 7

But, like other, less racist, societies, apartheid created also a further category of subordination and shame: that of deviant sexuality. There, too, the law stigmatized and persecuted a condition that was seen as undesirably shameful: homosexuality and same-sex sexual conduct. Of that category I was shamefully part. I was gay in an otherwise heterosexual world, a world that would accommodate me only to the extent that I managed to pretend that I was straight.

5 In a statement attributed to him in the *Boston Globe* of 25 October 1977, after his death, black consciousness activist Stephen Bantu Biko said, 'whites must be made to realize that they are only human, not superior. Same with blacks. They must be made to realize that they are also human, not inferior.' Sourced from http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Steve_Biko.

6 Aubrey Masango, 'Constructive criticism: if we can't give it who can?' *Daily Maverick* (2 October 2012), highlights Steve Biko's description of the contorted sense of self apartheid could create: http:// dailymaverick.co .za! opinionista/20 12-1 0-02-constructive-criticism-if-we-cant-give-it-who-can.

7 That this past still haunts us emerged in a recent controversy where an artist, Brett Murray, painted a portrait of President Jacob Zuma,' which was displayed for sale in a commercial art gallery in Johannesburg. The portrait was based on a famous image of Vladimir Lenin. But,, unlike the original, this portrait portrayed the figure represented with fully naked genitals. This elicited an impassioned reaction. The portrait was seen as shameful. It was criticized as degrading to the dignity of black people, and as rekindling the past where blacks were subordinated and shamed.

#### MORAL CITIZENSHIP AND CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION 469

When it came to determining the ambit of constitutional protection, those negotiating for gays and lesbians could plausibly contend that including sexual orientation as a protected condition was analogous to including race-both conditions had been harshly stigmatized under apartheid, and both had been subjected to severe indignity. By this path, the generous embrace of equality and non-discrimination was extended to sexual orientation. That same spirit has been evident in the Constitutional Court's jurisprudence. 8 In this chapter, I argue that the inclusion of sexual orientation as a protected ground in South Africa's Constitution, and the court's vigorous assertion of sexual orientation equality, can be fully understood only by understanding the indignity apartheid's racialized assault inflicted on black South Africans. That this protection has been based so centrally on asserting the inherent dignity of all reflects the continuing palpability of a past of indignity and shame.

### Legal stigma and moral citizenship

In 1963, in a justly famous analysis, the sociologist Erving Goffman identified the 'structural preconditions' of stigma as consisting in a trait or attribute that amounts to an 'undesired differentness'-one that contravenes society's expectations or the standards upon which collective identity is predicated.9 Stigma arises because society, through its social settings, laws, cultural practices, and policies, creates a structure and language for categorizing people, and hence for identifying qualities that are regarded ordinary or 'natural'. 10 These take on a normative meaning, which entails that those who cannot meet them are 'discredited' .U Discrediting confers an inferior social status, and concomitantly, .less power and access to resources. 12 This is the essence of social stigma, and it takes little imagination to see that apartheid legal institutions systematically 'discredited' black people.

At its most brutal, the legal apparatus of apartheid denied black South Africans the vote, land, freedom of movement, jobs, public office, educational

opportunity, the capacity to learn in their own languages, and the liberty to choose their sexual partners and spouses. It deprived them even of their South African citizenship. The process of degradation of civic status started with the European settlement of South Africa ih the seventeenth century. 13 Over time, successive white governments made laws that regulated both the public and the most intimate aspects of people's lives, and in particular, placed onerous restrictions on the movements, relationships, and economic choices of black people. 14

Perhaps the most oppressive embodiment of this control was the pass laws, 15 which required black people at all times to carry a document that denoted permission to be in a particular city or location for a specific purpose. The pass came to symbolize the viciousness and pettiness of apartheid. To be caught without a pass was a crime. Many hundreds of thousands of black South Africans were arrested every year for violating these laws, 16 and sentenced to jail terms, generally short but often repeated. The very spectre of arrest dominated black urban life. In this way, apartheid made criminals of a large proportion of South Africa's adult population. The system of discrimination, constraint, and denial required black people to collide, at every tum, with an omnipresent legal machinery that regulated their lives. The laws sought to erect and entrench 'separateness'. Necessarily, they embodied a pervasive strategy of repression and domination. 17 But they did more than this. They branded black South Africans as inferior. 18

The effect of apartheid's laws in 'discrediting' black people in this way was fiercely contested: indeed, it was the cause of an externally based liberation struggle and a massive internal rebellion. But the legal meaning of apartheid was to subordinate, discredit, and stigmatize blackness. That meaning inflicted injury on all who lived under it, black and white.

The injury was also subsumed internally. 19 The American W. E. B. Du Bois articulated how this may happen. He spoke of a world that yielded an African-American descendant of slaves 'no true self-consciousness, but only lets him see himself through the revelation of the other world' ;20 thus creating a sense of 'measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused contempt and pity'. But whose tape is to be used in this measurement? This question was taken up fiercely and eloquently by Stephen Bantu Biko, the young activist beaten to death in police detention in September 1977. He saw black people's struggle against racial categorization, restriction, and control as being against.'forces that seek to use your blackness as a stamp that marks you out as a subservient being' .21 He asserted a counter-consciousness, an assertive black consciousness, that sought 'to infuse the black community with a new-found pride in themselves, their efforts, their value systems, their culture, their religion, and their outlook to life' .22 His vision recognized the psychic scarring of legal stigma, as well as the internal dimension necessary to true liberation: 'The interrelationship between the consciousness of the self and the emancipatory programme is of paramount importance. ' 23 Biko proclaimed that the fundamental tenet of black consciousness was 'that the black man must reject all value systems that seek to make him a foreigner in the country of his birth and reduce his basic human dignity' .24 Biko rightly saw that the primary impact of apartheid was as a systematized affront to racial dignity, and that its reclamation was a task both public and private, both external and internal. This is so because the effect of systematic degradation

But the apartheid state assailed not only race. It also demeaned on the basis of sexual identity. Sexual expression was severely policed. In 1927, the Immorality Act forbade extramarital sexual relations between white and African people. This was amended after 1948 to prohibit sex between whites and any other race. And further, in 1949, the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages Act was enacted. This not only prohibited marriage between white people and members of all other races but also declared illegitimate any children born of a marriage later deemed invalid. 28

What was more, 'Apartheid South Africa exhibited a well-developed tradition of legally sanctioned discrimination against gays and lesbians. South Africa had gathered anti-homosexuality laws from each of its several legal traditions-all of which condemned homosexuality. The legal situation in pre-liberation South Africa was more harsh (de jure at least) than many of its neighbours. Whereas many Sub-Saharan nations have no explicit provisions related to homosexuality, South Africa has had condemnatory laws since colonization. ' 29

All sexual expression between men was proscribed. Laws against sodomy and 'unnatural offences' were fiercely enforced. In 1969, the apartheid ment expanded the common law and legislative prohibitions on sex between men.30 Right until the lag-years of apartheid, the apartheid parliament was

30 In that year section 20A was added to the Immorality Act 32 of 1957. It criminalized any act, even in private, if 'calculated to stimulate sexual passion or to give sexual gratification' between 'men at a party', defined as any occasion where more than two persons were present.

considering further expansions of these crimes.31 The symbolic effect of these laws was immense.32 As the Constitutional Court later noted, their meaning was 'that in the eyes of our legal system all gay men are criminals'. 33 The resonance with the way the pass laws made most black South Africans criminals is intense.

In my adolescent and early adult years, I experienced the debilitating effect of this criminality. I felt shame at what I was: a gay man with intense yearning for same-sex companionship and expression. And I felt fear that its expression would lead to a life-ruining confrontation with the criminal law. Sexual stigma stems from social discomfort or disregard for non-heterosexual behaviour, identity, relationships, or communities.34 It is oppressive and pervasive, and, as with race laws, it is exacerbated when the law brands the condition as inferior: when the law discredits it. As with the effects of racial subordination, the reparatory project is both private and public, both internal and external. And here the law is of immense importance. The capacity to function fully within the legal sphere, and to be viewed as a fully legal citizen, helps diminish internalization of dignity and shame. Biko's ideas were a premonitory articulation of what dignity has come to mean in South African constitutional jurisprudence: a rejection of any value system that reduces human worth. They also explain the central role of dignity in the South African constitutional order.

Dignity-based jurisprudence has helped to foster the notion of an inclusive moral citizenship in South Africa, unburdened by the humiliating exclusions and degradations of the past. That the equal protection of the laws should have been extended so comprehensively to gays and lesbians, no less than to South Africans oppressed by apartheid's suffocating racial codes, is one of the truly remarkable aspects of our transition. The explanation lies in the degrading experience of indignity under apartheid, which was in significant respects commoo to black South Africans and gays and lesbians. This argument can be advanced plausibly because gays and lesbians were deeply involved in fighting apartheid. 35

### Dignity as both a foundational value and a fundamental right

In the Constitution of South Africa, human dignity is both a founding value36 and a discrete right in the Bill ofRights.37 In fact, in the interim constitution under which South Africa's transition to democracy took place, dignity was listed only as a fundamental right.38 It was the Constitutional Court that declared, in its decision outlawing the death penalty, that dignity played a larger role than merely as a right: it was also the value on which the new democracy was founded. 39 As a direct response to *Makwanyane,40* the Constitutional As-· sembly, drafting South Africa's final constitution, listed dignity not only as a fundamental right, but also as a founding value. And dignity is one of only two rights-alongside the right to life-that is non-derogable.41

Dignity thus operates in the jurisprudence of the court in two ways: as a foundational value that informs the interpretation of all other rights; and as a fully justiciable right.42 Dignity is relatively rarely invoked as a right in itself.43 More often, it operates as a value infusing other rights, most particularly, perhaps, the right to equality.

Dignity has an important public dimension.44 This is.embodied in the tus and protection that legal, social, and political institutions confer. These enable us, without fear of abuse, discrimination, or constraint, to engage *out in the world* in the commitments and activities that embody who we are and what we wish to become-to attain self-actualization, despite the accidents of our birth and notwithstanding any incidents of lifestyle. The court has thus held that the anti-discrimination provisions of the constitution provide' 'a bulwark against invasions which impair human dignity', and that the coriunitment to

44 This public dimension of dignity has been given a unique flavour in South African jurisprudence by imbuing it with *ubuntu.* 

<sup>36</sup> Section 1 of the Constitution provides that the Republic of South Africa is one sovereign democratic state founded on the values that include 'Human dignity, the achievement of equality and the advancement of human rights and freedoms'.

<sup>37</sup> Section 10 of the Constitution provides that 'Everyone has inherent dignity and the right to have their dignity respected and protected' ..

dignity underpins the commitment to avoid discrimination.45 In this way, dignity is the basis ofthe court's anti-discrimination jurisprudence.

This in many ways follows societies that have vested dignity as a fundamental constitutional or jurisprudential value.46 The German Constitution, a product of the Second World War, established the 'inviolability' of human dignity and obliged state institutions to 'respect and protect' itY Although Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not specifically mention dignity, the jurisprudence of its Supreme Court has invoked 'respect for the inherent dignity of every human person' to ascribe meaning to those rights and freedoms. 48

The dignity and equality jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court has derived much of its formal and conceptual structure from that of the Supreme Court of Canada. 49 But the evolution of dignity as a constitutional value in South Africa has deeper roots; and it is wrong to think it was simply appropriated from elsewhere. 50 It is best understood through the indignity that apartheid inflicted on most South Africans. Dignity is intrinsic to each person (and may inhere in all beings). It comprises the deeply personal understandings we have of ourselves, and our worth as individuals and in our material and social context. No law or social practice can strip away dignity, in this sense.51 Apartheid was an assault on black South Africans' dignity, but its laws could not deprive them of their intrinsic human worth.

So the systematic humiliation and degradation that apartheid's legal structures inflicted on black people may not have detracted from their intrinsic human dignity. But it stemmed from an ideology of racial superiority that imputed to white skin colour and European culture a high value, while regarding black skin colour and African culture as inferior. This left a residue of indignity that was perceived and experienced as shameful. It is from this that

'Philosophically, we may say that dignity is inherent in the human person-and so it is. No law or social practice can take it away. But as a social and legal status, dignity has to be nourished and maintained by society and the law, and this ... is a costly and difficult business and something in which we are all required to play a part. At the very least, we are required in our public dealings not to act in a way that undermines on another's dignity in this socio-legal sense ... '

the conception of apartheid's racism as disgraceful stems: that it sought to inflict a state of disgrace on people for no morally sound or rational reason.SZ South African constitutional jurisprudence has thus sought to abolish the impediments of the past by ensuring that self-worth is recognized and protected by the formal institutions of the state and its law. Those who suffered from a disgraceful past would be restored to grace. We have neither forgotten nor fully healed from our oppressive past. But our constitution has given full recognition to those previously shamed and disgraced by an oppressive system. It has created a legal framework to permit rights-assertions that have enabled people to express their anger, to demand recognition. And in doing so, it has provided the means for overcoming that past, and for asserting, at an individual and collective level, a sense of dignity. The experience of the shameful effects of racial and gender subordination impelled those envisioning the new constitutional order to include protection for a wide array of conditions that under apartheid were disabling. Over the last decade and a half, South African law has invoked dignity to proscribe the criminal inhibitions on same-sex conduct, and to allow the recognition of same-sex partnerships, adoption, procreation, and marriage.

Dignity has also enabled the court's jurisprudence to advance individual personhood, and to erase the residues of shame by bringing differences in sexual functioning out of the hidden realm of the private sphere. The court's decisions have thus subverted the notion that, to avoid shameful disparagement, individuals' activities and relationships must subscribe to uniformity. The court's jurisprudence has sought not merely to abolish the impediments of the past by ensuring that self-worth is recognized and protected by the state and its institutions. It has sought to create a normative framework in which South Africans can assert their personhood without the shameful stigmata of past subordination.

In short, the function of dignity in South African constitutionalism, has been to repair indignity, to renounce humiliation and degradation, and to vest full moral citizenship in those who were denied it in the past.

#### Arriving at same-sex marriage

The earliest judgment of the Constitutional Court saw an inextricable link between dignity and equality. 53 But the role of dignity is evidenced most strikingly in the jurisprudence on the equality of gays and lesbians.

Over the last thirteen years, our law has invoked dignity to proscribe the criminalization of sodomy as well as to allow for the recognition of same-sex partnerships, adoptions, and, most recently, marriages. The pronouncements on same-sex relationships and marriage cannot be fully appreciated without understanding the impact of apartheid's expansive racialized assault on the dignity of the majority of South Africa's people. More tellingly, the same-sex rulings may not have been possible had courts relied exclusively upon the rights of privacy and equality.54 Dignity, both as a right and as a foundational value, has enabled our jurisprudence to bring people's differences out of the hidden realm of the private sphere, by undercutting the notion that individuals' activities and relationships must correspond with uniform norms.

The cases that led to constitutional recognition of same-sex marriage were themselves the product of a past that treated most South Africans as outcasts in their own country. Instead, the jurisprudence sought to affirm each individual's intrinsic worth, regardless of social station or public disapproval. 55 The court finally struck down the exclusion of same-sex couples from marriage, emphasizing the significant role of human dignity, equality and freedom. 56 The court highlighted 'four unambiguous features of the context in which the prohibition against unfair discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation must be analysed'.

nature of familial formation; the need to recognize the past persecution of gays and lesbians; the fact that no comprehensive legal regulation of gay and lesbian family law rights existed; and the fact that our constitution represents a 'radical rupture' with a past based on intolerance and exclusion. 57

These considerations stand in stark contrast to the views advanced by Professor Robert P. George in this collection 58 and elsewhere. 59 Professor George seeks to defend what he calls a 'conjugal' understanding of marriage-which defines marriage as 'the distinctive type of relationship that is ordered to, and would be naturally fulfilled by, the spouses having and rearing children together'. 60 This necessarily excludes from marriage those in same-sex relationships. While he claims that marriage has intrinsic rather than merely instrumental value, he regards its orientation to having children as a necessary element. I deal with these arguments only cursorily because, in my view, the impermissibility of same-sex marriage seems as difficult to propound on coherent and rational moral grounds as the impermissibility of interracial marriage.

Professor George's argument rests on the 'principle' of joint procreation. This notion as an animating justification for an exclusionary definition. 6f socially recognized human bonds is grossly flawedY First, it is over-inclusive-it 'demeans the marriages of many opposite-sex couples who do not give birth to biological children, including infertile couples, couples who have chosen not to have children, couples who have adopted, and couples who have used reproductive technologies to create their families'. 62 Second, it is arbitrarily stipulative. One can defend proscription of interracial marriage on the basis that marriage should be between people of the same race, but the stipulation is arbitrary. That marriage should be for procreation is equally arbitrary.

Professor George must either say that any loving relationship that exists upon an expressly non-child-bearing basis, whether same-sex or opposite-sex, cannot be a marriage; or he must divine some other basis on which to exclude same-sex couples from marriage. But he does neither. Instead, he reasons that

infertile and otherwise childless opposite-sex couples retain a 'basic orientation' towards bearing and rearing children, even though they may never have children.63 This is absurd, as well as arbitrary.

It is difficult to see why, given that procreation is no less biologically impossible in cases of infertility than in those of homosexuality, heterosexual intercourse by infertile couples is any more 'oriented' towards bearing children than that by same-sex couples. The only distinction, where procreation is impossible, is that heterosexual sex involves a penis in a vagina. It is ludicrous to suggest that this is an essential element of marriage.

Hence, Professor George is constrained to invoke arguments concerning the 'potential' and 'orientation' of opposite-sex coupling-because no other rational basis exists on which to make peno-vaginal coupling, as opposed to any other form of coupling, a matter of distinctive moment in marriage. Even where opposite-sex couples choose not to have children, it seems silly to say that it is the 'potential' for a relationship to produce children that is key to marriage. Opposite-sex couples, deeply committed and in love, who share a moral and ideological opposition to biological reproduction in our already overpopulated world, would rightly be shocked and perhaps affronted to learn that the true basis of their marriage is their unrealized biological ability to reproduce.

But all of this exposes a much deeper flaw in Professor George's posture. This is his attempt to impose rigid preconceptions on forms of human commitment, loving, sexual conjunction and partnership. This rigidity is precisely the evil that afflicted South Africa under apartheid, and which the dignity jurisprudence of its Constitutional Court has in its first two decades addressed. It is a like evil that this chapter addresses. In South Africa, a history of statecontrolled racial rigidity-including strictly defined racial categories, for which separate and segregated institutions were specifically created-had a mutilating impact on black and white alike.

It is in part through understanding the pernicious effects of that rigidity that the court has so fully embraced positive assertion of sexual orientation equality and diversity today. Today's arguments opposing same-sex marriage invoke the same rigidities, the same illogicalities, and the same absurdities of racism in South Africa's discredited past. 64 They deserve the same moral opprobrium.

# The limits of dignity

There is substantial criticism of dignity as a basis on which to adjudicate rights. A main concern has been that dignity is fuzzy-often rife with ambiguity, and hence difficult to give a concrete meaning or effect as a realizable right.65 One criticism is that using dignity can involve imposing a normative or ethical value onto individual behaviour or choice.66 And this has happened. InS *v Jordan,* 67 the majority rejected all challenges to the criminal prohibition on sex work. The minority would have overturned the criminal ban on narrow gender discrimination grounds. That judgment also rejected dignity as a basis. The minority said this was because it was not the criminalization of sex work but the commodification of a sex worker's body-that is, the work itself-that undermines her dignity.68 'The very character of the work they [sex workers] undertake devalues the respect that the Constitution regards as inherent in the human body'.

The judgment has been heavily criticized for making an unsustainable distinction between sexual activity that is subject to criminal sanction, and therefore subject to intervention by the state, and that which properly merits sanctuary in the private realm.69 Indeed, dignity's rhetorical and conceptual power may be inadequate to challenge narrow conceptions of naturalness or normalness. It has justly been said that *Fourie* idealizes marriage as the most appropriate way for two people to gamer public recognition and legitimation of their relationship.70 And critics warn that institutionalizing same-sex marriage may merely replace one set of repressive social norms with another legal sanction of sexual sameness or conformity, thus 'discrediting' those who do not conform.

but for the interference with his arrangement there would be no cause for such marriages. The fact that he separated the races shows that he did not intend for the races to mix.'

In *Le Raux v Dey,71* the court certainly frowned upon sexual display. The majority described an image published of the plaintiff, which he alleged was both defamatory and injurious to his feelings, as being of 'two promiscuous men who allowed themselves to be photographed in what can only be described as a situation of sexual immorality, which would be embarrassing and disgraceful to the ordinary members of society' ,72 and thus defamatory. A minority, of which I was part, found for the plaintiff on the narrower basis of affront to feelings *(iniuria* ), invoking infringement of dignity. We held that the plaintiff had suffered an affront to his subjectively experienced personal dignity.

Taken together, *Jordan* and *Le Raux* may offer evidence of conservatism about sexual expression. This may be contrasted with assertions elsewhere in the court's jurisprudence that no particular social norm for adult, consensual sexual expression should entrenched.73

# The possibilities of dignity

Notwithstanding this, dignity has enabled the court to secure a significant break from the past. As a value and as a right, dignity has affirmed and destigmatized those previously excluded. Crucially, it has also provided a framework for proscription of other forms of discrimination-for instance, against non-citizens-and for recognition of sexual expressiveness. It is against this backdrop, characterized by the internalization of stigma and disgrace for the majority of people in South Africa, that constitutionalism has sought to create a reparative legal framework--one in which injury to dignity can be repaired, and in which humanhood can be asserted.

The constitution here serves as a simple statement and thus an assertion of the dignity of all South Africans. In addition, its provisions provide symbolic affirmation, reinstatement, and reparation to those previously excluded, recognizing and affirming their diversity. It also provides a practical framework for the more difficult task of attaining internal dignity, and asserting it externally, by disclaiming stigma and disgrace, and affirming moral citizenship and worth. 74

74 It is this explanation I sought to advance to assuage Professor MacKinnon's expressed bemusement when she visited the court in February 2010--see the introduction and summary to this chapter.

The law cannot, on its own, create internal dignity or repair a history of degradation. Nor can it remove stigma or stop hatred. But it can reject branding people as subordinate and inferior, and thus making them objects of shame. The court's jurisprudence on the equality of gays and lesbians has addressed both social and legal equality, and sought to rectify the subordination of the past by enabling gays and lesbians to assert themselves as equal moral citizens who can fulfil their capacities as humans without shame. Dignity thus enables not conformity but rather the advancement of those aspects of our lives that have the potential to be distinct and extraordinary: traversing public spaces fearlessly, developing our minds and speaking freely, and perhaps finding love and generativity.
