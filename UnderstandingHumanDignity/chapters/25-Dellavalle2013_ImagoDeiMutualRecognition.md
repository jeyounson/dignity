# **From** *Imago Dei* **to Mutual Recognition: The Evolution of the Concept of Human Dignity in the Light of the Defence of Religious Freedom**

*Sergio Dellavalle* 

Can religious freedom be founded on human dignity?

IF WE CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP between assertions of human dignity and the declaration of specific human rights in the main legal instruments of the international community, dignity appears to be an ontological foundation of all these rights. The conclusion that might be drawn is, therefore, that dignity can serve as an ontological basis also for the right to religious freedom. Yet such a claim is far from self-evident: rather, the ability of the concept of human dignity to deliver the necessary link between the legal discourses on religious freedom and the pre-legal conditions of peaceful and respectful human interaction depends largely on how the concept of dignity is interpreted.

Within the Western tradition, the concept of human dignity is historically related to the idea of human beings as *imagines Dei.* This connection, however, does not guarantee any convincing ontological, axiological, and epistemological basis for the principled defence of religious freedom. 1 If based on the vision of man as *imago Dei,* dignity depends on the acceptance of a particular relationship between the members of an individual religious community and a divine entity. From this perspective, humans who do not share the religious belief thought to be true by the members of the individual religious community tend to be marginalized, discriminated against, or even persecuted (as discussed in section one).

<sup>1</sup> The opposite approach is presented, in different nuances, by many authors included in this volume. See, in particular, the contributions by Julian Rivers (Chapter 23), Patrick Riordan (Chapter 24), and Joel Harrison (Chapter 26).

Modem rationalism and the philosophy of the Enlightenment have developed an alternative conceptual foundation for religious freedom, centred on the notion of tolerance. However, this approach has proven to be as inadequate as the belief-based vision for the purpose of understanding an idea of religious freedom conceived not only as a domain of 'negative freedom' but as an essential element of the self-realization of humans (as discussed in section two).

To overcome the deficits of both approaches, religious freedom should not only be regarded as permitting the members of an individual religious community to worship the divinity in which they believe in the way they prefer, but also-and even more so-as the condition under which humans may address fundamental existential questions through the exercise of social communication. As a consequence, the experience of faith shared by the members of every religious community should not just be 'tolerated' by legal and social norms and practices. Rather, it should be recognized as an essential enrichment of social interaction. On the basis of this paradigmatic shift, the deep involvement of faith communities in the existential issues that characterize religious experience would transcend the horizon of individual faith, transforming particular belongingness into a universal dimension of human communication, thus opening religious experience to intercultural dialogue (as discussed in section three).

The religiously-based approach: the ontological understanding ofhuman dignity resulting from the understanding of man as the 'image of God'

In order to answer the question whether religious freedom can be grounded in the concept of human dignity, it is necessary, first, to consider briefly the historical roots of the concept and, specifically, its relationship with religious traditions and beliefs. There are good reasons to believe that a basic idea of human dignity can be found within the cultural inheritance of the great part of existing civilizations, and in particular of all world religions.2 In non-theistic religions, such as Buddhism, human dignity can be generally related, as in nearly all moral theories, to the general capacity of humans to 'differenti-

ate between what is right and what is wrong'. 3 In contrast, in the theistic religions-and particularly in monotheism-the exceptional worth of human beings depends directly on God's revelation and on the belief that God gave humans an exceptional position among all creatures.

The religiously based idea of human dignity, however, is always characterized by particular limitations. Starting with the non-theistic approach, the claim to human dignity in Buddhism is not only a relatively new phenomenon, with rather fragile roots in the tradition,4 but also embeds the human capacity to moral judgement into a holistic and organic view of the whole world, unlike reflexive moral theories. But if the worth of man is regarded only as a part of a whole in this sense, it becomes difficult to understand wherein lies the specificity of the human condition.

Turning now to the theistic traditions in general, and to monotheism in particular, the idea of a privileged relationship between humans and a personal God seems to be, at least at first glance, an excellent starting point to claim the uniqueness of man. However, what appears to be the specific strength of monotheism can also turn out to be its main weakness, especially as regards the attempt to found the protection of religious freedom on the centrality of human dignity.

In Judaism, for example, although respect for human dignity may supersede Rabbinic law, under certain circumstances, it can never be regarded as generally superior to the highest commandment, namely to honour God and his laws. 5 Therefore, 'the principle of human dignity should not be used to disregard the laws of God'. 6 The historical connection between human dignity and religious commandment is also evident in the Islamic tradition. Here we find, besides the doctrinal school of Ash'ariyyah which asserts that human dignity can be derived exclusively from Allah's will laid down in Holy Qur'an, the more rationalistic approach of the Mu'tazilah school, in which human dignity can be drawn from both the Holy Scripture *as well as* rational considerations, although these too should be confirmed in the holy texts.

But it is precisely this kind of final derivation of human dignity from God's will that is the root of the main problem that affects theistic conceptions of the allegedly unique worth of man. If man's distinctive value is drawn

from an incontestably free decision of the Creator, it will be quite difficult to declare human dignity as an inherent quality of human ontological and social condition. But, if human dignity has to be derived from extra-human sources, it could hardly be regarded as an ultimate good, depending only on what human beings owe to themselves and to their fellow humans. Moreover, if the assertion and protection of human dignity hangs on the profession of faith in individual and distinct divinities by particular distinct religious communities, two further questions arise. First, how can a universal claim derive from the belief of a specific community in the incontestability of a particular revelation? Being based on faith, a dialogue on dignity could not reach beyond the scope of each community, becoming an internal debate within each specific religion. Second, what happens to individuals and peoples who do not belong to the religious community which is regarded by its members as the one and only possessor of religious truth and, therefore, of the true understanding of human dignity? Are those outside not in continuous danger of being persecuted or at least discriminated against?

These problems are perfectly exemplified by the Christian tradition. Christendom is beyond doubt the theistic religion that has most profoundly shaped the Western understanding of human dignity. Christian philosophy developed the idea of human dignity mainly from the vision of man as in the image of God, as first outlined by the Jewish tradition7 and presented in the Old Testament. 8 In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas made belief in man as in the image of God a central element ofhis moral theory.9 This approach was then generally adopted by Catholic theology. According to the Catholic understanding, human dignity has not been corrupted by original sin and is therefore complete and integral in every human being. This embryonic universalism was reinforced by the belief-shared also by Protestant doctrines-that the Christian gospel is addressed to all humans. This universalistic perspective in moral philosophy and theology did not, however, deter Catholic countries from barbaric persecution and enslavement of non-Christian peoples. Nor did it prevent Catholic theologians and philosophers from sometimes crude, 10 sometimes subtle, justifications of discrimination and persecution. 11 Unlike in

Catholic doctrine, Protestant theologians generally assumed, following Martin Luther's interpretation, 12 that human dignity had been damaged by original sin and could be completely restored only in eschatological perspective. In the best case, the final re-establishment of the perfection of man's privileged nearness to God could be anticipated by strict observance of religious precepts within the communities of the 'elect'. This assumption favoured the establishment of social and legal rules that openly discriminated against members of other religious communities, and even more against atheists. 13

From an historical perspective, the reference to man as in the image of God seems not to provide, therefore, a sufficient basis for a really universalistic understanding of human dignity, 14 nor a robust justification for religious freedom. This conclusion is not surprising since the idea of *imago Dei* links dignity to faith in a specific, individual God, always putting those who are outside this specific religious community into a condition of potential inferiority. Sometimes, the danger of discrimination could be successfully overcome, while remaining within a mainly religious perspective, by resorting to the use of natural reason, which is generally accepted by theistic religions. Moreover, path-breaking documents issued by both the Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches expressly outlined that 'the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person', 15 or reaffirmed the essential relationship between human dignity, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and the privileged closeness of man to God. 16 Nevertheless, in most historic situations-and still quite often in the present-the assumption of the nearness of man to God did not-and still does not-adequately guarantee universalistic respect for human dignity or effective protection of religious freedom.

This argument does not imply that it is impossible for an individual to derive a reason and an obligation to respect human dignity from the firm belief in what we regard to be a religious truth. The point is rather that, if we claim dignity exclusively on the basis of religious convictions, it will hardly be possible to convince non-religious individuals as well as members of other religious communities, who share a different faith, of the compelling quality of such an assertion. Belonging to a religious group or faith is ultimately a highly intimate question of conscience, and therefore a universalism based only on religious precepts is ultimately doomed to fail.

# The autonomy-based approach: religious freedom as a result of toleration

One result of the ambiguities of the religiously based understanding of dignity and religious freedom has been that the case for liberty in worshipping God or in not worshipping any deity, depending on one's own conscience, has come to be based, since the end of the seventeenth century, on religiously neutral assumptions or on arguments explicitly contesting the centrality of religion in social life. This non-religiously based position was first introduced by John Locke in his Letter concerning Toleration (1689), and developed later into a legal and political position best known for its rigid defence of the separation between public and religious domains. From this perspective, the separation between public sphere and religion implies a substantial indifference by the public power towards religious issues, which are seen as essentially private questions. Locke makes a clear distinction between the nature and functions of the 'commonwealth', as the sphere of public relevance, and those of the 'church'Y In Locke's view, the commonwealth consists only in those institutions which guarantee the external conditions for individuals to develop themselves and pursue their interests. Individual actions undertaken to support such developments and improvements fall entirely into the private domain and are of no concern to public institutions. Practices and-in general-forms of social interaction focused on questions of existential significance are completely irrelevant for the public sphere. It is religious communities that have the task of taking care of those dimensions of human life which are, according to Locke's understanding, outside the horizon of public interest.

17 John Locke, *A Letter concerning Toleration* (1689), in John Locke, *Works* (London, 1824), vol. 5, 10.

From this contrasting of public and religious spheres, Locke derives the central principle of his theory, that the state should never intervene in religious questions. Locke's innovative proposal was made possible by a paradigmatic revolution in the understanding of social order18 initiated by Thomas Hobbes several decades before Locke wrote his Letter on toleration. This revolution marked the passage from a holistic to an individualistic conception of the ontological foundation of human society. In antiquity and during the Middle Ages, individuals were considered as though they would quasi-naturally belong to the social, political, and cultural community in which they had been born and lived. Thus, the community was regarded as not only genetically but also ontologically and axiologically superior to the individual. As a result, the main task of political life consisted in maintaining the cohesion of the community and not in safeguarding individual rights. With the beginning of the Modem Age, the philosophical and political climate changed. Individual rights came to the fore, so that individuals were not any more seen as part of a given and predetermined community but as single entities, endowed with rights, reason, and interests. On the basis of these qualities, they can-and, rationally, should-decide to come together to form a political community, as an act of free will, constituting a society of free individuals for the purpose of improving their life conditions and protecting their original rights more efficiently and reliably.

Through the contract theory of state, philosophers who embraced this individualistic paradigm of social order refounded the justification and legitimation of public power by ingeniously resorting to a traditional instrument of private law, the contract. In the liberal variant of contractualism, the essentials of which were laid down by Locke in his political philosophy, 19 individuals entrust legitimate public power created by the contract with little authority. According to the liberal view, the state should only guarantee the conditions of 'negative' liberty, that is, the private space within which individuals pursue their happiness and improve their material and spiritual lives. Religious experience in all its forms belongs to this space. Religion is relegated to the private sphere and divorced from any sense of public endorsement by the political organization of the community. By doing so, Locke's approach can safeguard religious freedom in a way that was unknown to traditions which had-and have-based it on the premise of man as in the image of God.

The conceptual move from the incontrovertible and revelation-based vision of man as in the image of God to this proposal of an effective-becausenegative religious freedom is characterized by two important elements. First, human rights, and therefore also religious freedom, are no longer based on dignity as the ontological relationship between man and the 'whole' *('halon')*  (whether of society, of the religious community, or of the universe) but on the free will of individual subjects, and therefore on autonomy. Second, the liberty to worship God following one's own conscience no longer relies positively on an appreciation of the social and axiological value of reflections on the most deep and involving existential questions but ultimately on a negative indifference about these dimensions of human life for the construction of a functioning civil society. Precisely because of the alleged irrelevance of existential and religious dimensions of human life for politics, at least as long as the religious communities do not threaten the cohesion of citizens based on the contract,20 questions concerning religion are left to the domain of negative liberty, in which men are free since the law is silent. As a result, religious pluralism should be tolerated, rather than positively protected.

Despite its numerous advantages compared with the previous religiously based understanding, the interpretation of religious freedom as a consequence of toleration, and not based on a recognition of the positive value of the plurality of religious discourses, is also characterized by serious deficits. The first problem arises if we consider that the political and juridical institutions are far less neutral than we usually believe; rather, they mirror the cultural, historic and religious tradition of a country. Thus, if the political and juridical institutions of the society do not actively safeguard the general conditions for the free exercise of religious and cultural practices, minorities are likely to be discriminated against in practice.

If this warning against the bias embedded in the alleged neutrality of institutions may be seen as a kind of truism, the second issue is much more complicated and contestable. We identified earlier a general assumption that the religious neutrality of political and juridical institutions depends on their indifference to existential discourses and, ultimately, on the irrelevance of these discourses for other domains of social life. But is it really true that political and juridical institutions cannot actively protect practices of cultural and religious groups without losing the impartiality that is constitutive of a liberal understanding of social life, provided that all groups that are not breaking fundamentallaws of peaceful coexistence are equally protected? And is it really a throwback to old-fashioned bigotry if we claim that the whole of society,

including also political and juridical institutions, benefits from the lively involvement of a large part of the community in serious and engaged discourse on the existential, moral, and religious dimensions of life?

# Dignity as communicative autonomy and the tenets of recognition

In order to sketch the essential elements for a possible answer to the shortcomings of both the previously identified positions, that of religious freedom based on an onto logically founded idea of dignity and that of a merely negative toleration of religious pluralism, it is necessary to find a way beyond the dichotomy between dignity and autonomy, away from sheer tolerance to a more positive mutual recognition. The active protection of religious freedom can be justified by resorting to the idea of a universal human dignity only if we successfully meet the following challenges: a) the concept of human dignity should be separated from having any privileged connections to religious beliefs; and b) religious pluralism should not be seen as a fact that has to be accepted so as to avoid disruptive social tensions or because religious questions do not matter in the public sphere, but should be recognized as an added value for the richness of social discourse.

#### **Relationship with religious beliefs**

The religiously based conceptions of human dignity draw the unique worth of man from a source that, at least in the eyes of their supporters, is ontologically located outside human society. Furthermore, in theistic conceptions this source consists in the will of an individual-and thus a particular-deity. If the concept of human dignity is to overcome the shortcomings ofheteronomy and- particularism, it must be directly founded on human beings themselves, and human interaction as well as human society must be conceived as universal in their scope.

Both steps were undertaken for the first time in Western thought in Stoic philosophy.21 Before the emergence of Stoicism, ancient philosophy had no clear perception of what can be called the universal worth of humans; indeed, individuals were recognized as valuable mainly as citizens of a *polis.* As a consequence, the only universal features of man were seen in his natural constitution and, to a certain extent, in his general moral dispositions. In contrast, the Stoic claim to the universality of human beings was founded on an inno-

<sup>21</sup> J. von Arnim, *Stoicorum veterum fragmenta* (Lipsiae, Teubneri, 1905).

vative understanding of the entire system of philosophical disciplines, from logics to ontology and from ethics to political philosophy. Stoic philosophers conceived human societies as ruled by a universal *nomos,* which, for its part, was directly linked to the *logos.* The logos, which was also universal, was regarded as the logical grammar of the whole world and-together with 'matter' ('vA-11)-as one of the ontological foundations of the universe. Because of this philosophical structure, humans have a unique value as the holders of reason, which is here linked to the essence of the *halon.* Furthermore, this value is a distinctive feature of every human being and has to be generally acknowledged. Beyond the borders of the single polity, men were ultimately regarded, from the Stoic perspective, as citizens of a worldwide cosmopolis. Concretely, the universalistic paradigm of social order is realized, in Stoic political philosophy, by assuming that human beings are distinguished by a general tendency to 'sociability' *'obctlwau;).* From this postulation derives the assertion that humankind as a whole builds a universal community on shared values and interests.

The Stoic perspective on human dignity seems to guarantee the fulfilment of the first condition of a convincing approach to developing a truly universalistic understanding of human dignity, namely that the unique value of man does not depend on faith and religious beliefs but on the inherent quality of human beings. This quality is explicitly universal, and the core element of the worldwide community of human beings is built on it.

Despite its important achievements, this Stoic understanding of human dignity suffers from at least three significant flaws. First, the claim to human dignity depends on a metaphysical postulation, namely that man is the highest expression of the 'objective' *logos* of the world, that is empirically impossible to prove. Specifically, if the worth of man derives from his privileged connection to the 'objective' rationality of the *halon,* every difficulty we may find in determining the 'objectivity' of such rationality would result in a setback of human dignity itself, and such difficulties are very likely to occur. Second, the assumption of the universal sociability of humans is a risky bet in a world that also evidences, besides solidarity, innumerable episodes of indifference and cruelty. If we really want to defend human dignity, we should avoid resort to overly optimistic presumptions and conceive of it as an endangered good, one which deserves to be protected precisely because it is not a naturally given brute fact but a highly sensitive result of civilization. Third, the. holistic perspective of Stoicism largely ignores the centrality of individuals; human dignity is disconnected from the distinctive features of the individual use of theoretical and, above all, practical reason. If human dignity has to be understood as concrete, it should be linked to the specific quality

of individual action-and not only to the metaphysical essence of man as a distant ontological being.

A first step towards a solution at least to the third problem was undertaken, in the early modern ages, by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Inspired by the newly awakened interest in the humanities in the era of the Renaissance, Pico located the uniqueness of man in his capacity to improve himselfby acts of free will,22 In Pico's understanding, human dignity does not arise just from the possession of *logos* by humankind as a whole, and hence from its advantaged ontological position within a rational cosmos. Rather, dignity emerges, as an individual entitlement, from what every single human being can make of this ontological status by means of his practical reason and behaviour.

Nevertheless, even if we admit that human dignity had been reassigned, within the humanistic perspective of the Renaissance, to the free will of individuals, partially overcoming one of the flaws that burdened the metaphysical conception elaborated by the Stoic philosophy, the two further shortcomings-namely the tendencies to a metaphysical explanation of the uniqueness of human beings as well as to the presupposition, in social philosophy, of an unprovable harmonious whole comprehending all humans-remained unresolved. To find a solution to these issues we have to skip many centuries of philosophical history, coming to what can be defined as the paradigmatic revolution towards a communicative understanding of social order.23

According to the communicative paradigm of social order,24 communicati:pp. always presupposes, in order to work, the mutual recognition by all participants in the discursive interaction. In other words, discursive communication can achieve its goal only if all those involved mutually assume that: a) from an objective perspective, the assertions are true (in the sense that the propositions are referred to real situations or facts); b) from a subjective perspective, the speakers act truthfully (in the sense that they are committed to fair-minded purposes, ahd are sincerely persuaded that their assertions meet the conditions for truth); c) from an intersubjective perspective, the speakers interact according to the principles of rightness (in the sense that they accept

Habermas, *Vorstudien und Ergiinzungen zur Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns* (Frankfurt am Main, Suhrkamp, 1984).

that their assertions have to meet the criteria for a general and mutual acknowledgement by all participants in the communication).25

Against the background of the communicative paradigm, human dignity is not based on metaphysical assumptions but is concretely rooted in the normative pragmatics of human interaction. According to this understanding, human dignity is thus not an abstract principle but illustrates the actual *modus operandi* of human beings in their relations with each other. Moreover, dignity is here intersubjective in its essence, since it does not describe primarily a quality of individuals conceived as single and isolated subjects but an inherent feature of functioning and normatively non-curtailed social communications. In other words, dignity is the concept that denotes, in· general, the mutual compliance with the conditions of recognition within the pragmatic context of social interaction.

If dignity is interpreted as grounded on the mutual respect of human beings as participants in a discursive interaction based on the criteria for a 'true' communication (truth, truthfulness, and rightness), the question arises as to whether and how dignity should be recognized and attributed also to fellow humans who do not want or are not capable of meeting those criteria. At leaSt two cases are imaginable: the first concerns extraordinarily infamous criminals; the second concerns young children, as well as the mentally disabled or individuals with dementia. Can dignity, understood in a pragmatic and postmetaphysical way, be bestowed also on these categories of humans? The solution consists, first, in considering that communication and the recognition founded on it have not only semantic and pragmatic components but are also highly emotional processes. In this sense, although children, disabled individuals, or those with dementia may have insuperable difficulties in articulating arguments, they can nevertheless communicate-at least at an emotional level-in a way which may be far more respectful of truth, truthfulness, and rightness than the communication that takes place between fully 'rational' and mentally healthy adult humans. Second, when we communicate with other human beings, we do not ascertain only the reality of the discursive interaction. Rather, we are always aware of the possibilities that are enshrined in human interaction as well. These possibilities define what A pel called the 'ideal community of comniunication'. 26 This is always in tension with the 'real community' but is, nonetheless, indispensable for effective recognition in reality.

Within the 'community of communication' --either real or ideal-humans, although not 'images of God' any more, are nevertheless always 'images of human beings', and ought to be treated as such. Therefore, the most infamous criminal also has to be considered a )lolder of the value of dignity, in spite of the wrong he has done and for the sake of the good that he, as a human, could have done or even may do in the future, however improbable that may seem.

A second question focuses on the circumstance that, in general, the assertion of human dignity necessarily places human beings in a privileged position compared with all other living creatures and, a fortiori, compared with the non-living universe. This assumption does not imply, nevertheless, that other creatures would not deserve respect for their lives or, at the very least, for their capacity to feel pain. From the perspective of a communicative understanding of human dignity, pleading for the uniqueness of humans only means that respect for other creatures or for the environment is justified, not through our belonging to the whole of the universe but otherwise: by taking into account the moral· analogy of our relation to certain living creatures, the indispensability· of a safe environment for the quality of human life, or the aesthetic uniqueness of our experience of nature.

From.the perspective of the communicative paradigm, the concept ofhuman dignity is integrated by two corollaries that are significant for the present inquiry. First, the boundary that traditionally divided dignity and autonomy is fading away: in the communicative understanding, indeed, autonomy-both individual and collective-is the condition for the realization of a non-metaphysical conception of dignity as the status of mutual recognition; and dignity is nothing less than the guarantee that autonomy does not degenerate into a mere solipsistic arbitrariness, since it always maintains standards of reciprocity and self-respect as prerequisites of a normatively fully fledged social interaction.

Second, the communicative paradigm allows us a better comprehension of the distinction between the religious dimension and the public sphere. According to the communicative understanding of social order, society is the sum of different forms of interaction, each of them centred on a specific discourse. These different forms of interaction operationalize diverse understandings of reason and eventually lead to separate normative results.27 One of these forms of interaction concentrates on issues regarding the existential identity of the self and of the community. In this, individuals communicate with each other in order to clarify the sense of their lives as individuals and as a culturally specific group. The special context of this kind of communication is the re-

ligious, *Weltanschauung-based,* ideological or cultural community, held together by shared values aiming to give an answer to existential questions. The values elaborated in this kind of communication do not claim to be universal; rather, they express principles on which individuals· choose to orientate their existence. The members of a religious group, for instance, may be deeply convinced that their beliefs are the best basis on which to find sense in their life, but no justification is given to impose these beliefs on members of other cultural or religious communities, for example through legal compulsion. In a liberal and post-metaphysical society, observance of particular principles of life conduct should not be demanded from all members of the society.

In contrast, we speak of a political dimension of the social discourse when the communication is about the political identity of the community, when the members of a society argue about the best ways to address shared issues of public concern. In this case, individuals are not searching for existential sense, nor is discourse centred on identity questions. Rather, discourse consists in elaborating, in an inclusive discussion, the best ways to achieve the good government of society, an order which offers to all citizens subject to it the best possible chances of self-realization and self-enhancement. This distinction between existential and political discourses makes it possible to distinguish clearly the religious from the public domain, without any possible confusion. Nonetheless, neither domain can be considered self-sufficient since l!ach of them, despite its specificity, is interlinked with the other(s) through the role played by communicative rationality: through respect for objective truth, subjective truthfulness, and intersubjective rightness, communicative reason characterizes all spheres of human interaction in which strategic or functional thinking are not reason's last word.

#### **Religious pluralism**

If existential-and thus also religious--discourses are an essential component of intersubjective communication, what is it about the plurality of such discourses? Should such pluralism just be tolerated,· or is it a value that should be protected? The question concentrates, essentially, on how 'toleration' should be understood. In Locke's view, toleration corresponds to a substantial indifference of the public sphere towards the religious dimension of individual and collective experience. In the history of political philosophy, however, we can find also another approach, which had been prominently set out, at the same time of Locke's writing, by Pierre Bayle. In his *Commentaire philosophique,*  Bayle maintains that religious pluralism is not just harmless to political stability: on the contrary, it is a downright blessing for society. According to Bayle's understanding, religions are in the same mutual relationship as 'artisans' who, though each of them concentrates on his own work, cooperate for the sake of the common good.28 The different confessions enrich each other through each being stimulated by the others to seek for ever more profound, touching, and convincing answers to religious and existential questions. 29 As a result, religious plurality improves the scope and quality of existential and religious discourse within a society making it, at large, culturally livelier and ethically stronger. The condition for such a positive development-Bayle adds-is that public power should protect the distinct religious communities with the same energy and commitment.30 The greater danger to society does not arise, therefore, from religious pluralism but from its opposite, from the use of persecution as the violent imposition ofhomogeneity.31

What Bayle is delineating here, therefore, is an ambitious theory of recognition, in which different religious con:ununities reciprocally acknowledge the equal worth and dignity of their respective ways of worshipping God following their own conscience (or even of not worshipping any deity), creating in this way a common space of respectful communication between individual faith, religious identity of groups, and the common good above them all, in a virtuous circle. 32 From this perspective, religious freedom does not describe an empty place, indifferent to public power, but a value worth being actively defended and supported. If we accept that dignity is a communicative value and existential-religious discourses are an important component of social communication, we can assert, at last, that religious freedom is indeed based on the broader concept of human dignity, and that the defence of religious plurality is a fundamental task of any political and juridical institution that cherishes the cultural and ethical improvement of society.
