# **The Triple Dilemma of Human Dignity: A Case Study**

#### *Christoph Mollers*

### Introduction

THE FOLLOWING rs A CASE study that aims to argue systematically against applying the principle of human dignity in a legal order that respects individual rights. Our case, a decision of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) on the right to privacy, will be used as an example of the dilemmas the application of human dignity in a legal system can create. The first part of this chapter presents the facts of the case, section two its solution by the ECtHR and possible alternative solutions. In section three we will identify three basic contradictions within the discourse of human dignity that appear in our case: contradictions among various concepts of the meaning of human dignity, different relational approaches to the scope of this guarantee, and the claims to generality and applicability of human dignity. The chapter ends with a short plea for less demanding and less general solutions for the judicial protection of human rights (section four).

# The case: *KU v Finland:* the facts and the decision

In a case decided in 2008, 1 the ECtHR was confronted with the following facts. A photo and a physical description of a twelve-year-old boy (henceforth the victim) were posted on an online dating site and used as a sexual advertisement by a third person (henceforth the perpetrator) without knowledge or consent of the victim or his parents. The father of the victim asked the police to identify the perpetrator. The Internet service provider denied the police access to his files, considering itself bound to national laws of data protection.

<sup>1</sup> *KU v Finland,* Application no. 2872/02, 2008.

All attempts by the police and the prosecution to obtain the data failed at all three levels in the national court system of Finland. The national courts unanimously held that there was no statutory basis allowing the service provider to disclose the information or entitling the police to seize it from the provider. According to then-applicable Finnish law, this kind of information could only be seized to pursue certain defined criminal offences, none of which were relevant in this case. The manager in charge of the dating service could not be prosecuted because the prosecution of the alleged offence was at the moment of the prosecution already time-barred.

The ECtHR decided that the posting of a sexual solicitation of a twelveyear-old fell under Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), the right to privacy and family life:

> The Court reiterates that, although the object of Article 8 is essentially to protect the individual against arbitrary interference by the public authorities, it does not merely compel the State to abstain from such interference: in addition to this primarily negative undertaking, there may be positive obligations inherent in an effective respect for private or family life (see *Airey v Ireland,*  judgment of9 October 1979, Series A no. 32, § 32). (para. 42)

The court concluded that under Article 8 of the ECHR, Finland was obliged to provide a legal framework allowing the police to identify the name of the perpetrator:

> The Court considers that practical and effective protection of the applicant required that effective steps be taken to identify and prosecute the. perpetrator, that is, the person who placed the advertisement. (para. 49)

# Why this case?

As the reader will have noticed, in its reasoning the ECtHR makes no reference to the notion of human dignity. Human dignity is not even an explicit right of the ECHR, though it has been used by the ECtHR, especially in cases concerning cruel punishment.2 But the fact that the ECtHR did not mention human dignity should not irritate the reader. When trying to explore a conceptual problem, we do not depend on the semantic use of human dignity in a specific positive legal order,3 at least not as long as we can argue that the problems of our case are usually discussed within the framework of human

dignity. This is also the case here. The case concerns different questions that are regularly addressed as ones of human dignity: sexual autonomy,4 the right to privacy,5 and the question of whether the state has a duty to protect these rights.6

The chapter uses this case as an example to illustrate three conceptual contradictions that the idea of an overall notion of human dignity entails: The contradiction between a sphere of protected privacy and the development of a social personality, between individual autonomy and the protection by public authorities (which can be reframed as a contradiction between reading human dignity as a right or reading it as a value), and between the interpretation of human dignity as a general political compromise formula and its use to decide individual cases.

To develop these points, our case may be interesting and illuminating for two reasons: first, because of its triadic structure. Three parties are involved in the simplified version of the case that we will analyse here. Also, all three are in a certain sense judged upon by the ECtHR. There is the juvenile victim whose identity was falsely posted on the Internet, the unidentified perpetrator, and the state, which has, in effect, no choice other than to offer a solution to the conflict by acting or declining to act.7 The second reason for the case's relevance lies in the different normative roles that perpetrator and victim are playing. Since the victim has been involuntarily exposed to the public, his protected capability to socialize has thereby been compromised. The perpetrator remains anonymous, but this anonymity may be worth being protected as well. In many cases, dignity issues confront other, colliding normative claims. In relatively few cases, like this one, can competing claims be justified by a common reference to human dignity.

# constellation of the case and its possible solutions

Among the virtually infinite number of possible legal reactions to our case, three types of solutions can be singled out. The first would leave the actors alone with the exception of using private law remedies, remedies that would not work in our case because of the anonymity of the perpetrator. The second

Sunstein, *The Partial Constitution* (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1998); for the relation between action and nonaction see below *infra The substantial question: private intimacy or social persona?* 

would explicitly prohibit and penalize the action of the perpetrator by means of public and criminal law, yet abstain from any obligation to keep track of online activities by which the crime was committed. This was the national legal order's solution when the case was decided. A third solution would indeed oblige the state to provide instruments through which the perpetrator could be identified and punished. This was the court's solution.

One important characteristic of the case lies in the fact that solutions one and two do not help the victim at all. For this constellation, they are simply of normative--one might also say expressive-value. Such an expressive function may be important for the legal community, but it cannot help to redefine the relationship between victim and perpetrator. Another, less ·obvious but equally relevant, characteristic of the case is that solution three not only helps the victim secure a concrete remedy from the perpetrator but also necessitates a whole bundle of state measures that infringe on the rights ofvirtually everybody else. In order to track the perpetrator, all of his Internet communication would have to be secured and traced back. Such measures would include an obligatory saving of files by Internet providers, comparable to the much disputed Data Retention Directive of the European Union that has been the object of constitutional litigation in different member states-,-litigation in which the notion of human dignity has played an explicit role.8

To a certain degree, this rather dramatic consequence is owing to particular technicalities oflnternet communication, but not entirely: simifar trade-otis can be observed with other instruments of criminal prosecution, for example the analysis of DNA. One could think of a comparable case constellation in which a raped woman asks for a remedy that would allow the offender to be identified. Introducing such instruments into a criminal justice system would mean making everybody identifiable for the sake of prosecuting the crimes of some. The sheer number of persons affected by such measures is not necessarily troublesome for an absolute concept ofhuman dignity. 9 One violation of human dignity may claim a higher normative value than the violation of many

The German Federal Constitutional Court uses the notion of human dignity to define absolute limits of the same instruments that the ECtHR finds must be applied in our case; see footnote 20.

other only relative rights. 10 Still, as we will see, human dignity could appear on both sides of this equation.

### A triple contradiction within human dignity

We may distinguish rather crudely between two basic approaches in the contemporary discourse on human dignity: The first tries to develop a correct systematic understanding of the concept by arguing from political theory or international or constitutionallaw. 11 The second looks at the variety of interpretations in a kind of second-order observation, searching for internal contradictions and historical path-dependencies. 12 It seems that both approaches have their merits and cannot be substituted for each other. There is no choice between the quest for good reasons for a certain understanding of a norm on the one hand and, on the other, the reflective observation of the way the norm is used and changing. 13 This chapter follows the second approach. 14 In the next section we will analyse some of the internal tensions within common understandings of human dignity. But it is equally important to mention that this second way of dealing with human dignity is applied here to a case and the reasoning of a court: Courts, unlike theorists, have no choice but to make a decision and to give their own reasons for it. Therefore, the way courts treat concepts like human dignity belongs decidedly to the first approach. Courts are not entitled to reflect on the contingencies of the reasons they apply. We must take this institutional necessity into account when we have a closer look at what I call the triple contradiction within human dignity.

# The substantial question: private intimacy or social persona?

It is a truism that the concept of human dignity protects something that is specific to humans. The basic dilemma in this assumption is that human dignity is supposed to protect individual persons, but that many of the defining characteristics of human beings function only as social capabilities: language, deliberation, critique, pride. 15 Here lies, beyond the shop-worn question of how to relate individual and collective preferences, a much more interesting and relevant cognitive problem: it is far from clear where the individual self ends and where the social context begins. Even the human body itself draws an unreliable line: by taking DNA samples from suspects, we refuse to define an absolute corporeal limit to individual freedom. This dilemma was already vivid in the early, quite collectivist jurisprudence of the German Constitutional Court, 16 and is still present in many contemporary legal interpretations of human dignity. It seems to boil down to two protective ideals: on the one hand the ideal of the autonomous subject with a space of his or her own which is protected from any disturbance, and on the other the ideal of the social persona whose dignity enables successful participation in a community.

The first model may be rooted in a Kantian tradition, though it probably cannot be based on a plausible reading of Kant's own philosophy.17 ·In this \ reading, human dignity refers to a qualification of the subject as such, to its ability to make free and reasonable decisions. Obviously, for a strictly Kantian account there is nothing here to be protected by law, as the ability to reason falls outside the realm of the external causal world in which the law, unlike moral obligations, has its place. But in a different interpretation, the protection of human dignity may be understood as referring to the practical conditions of a rational personality. In this reading, human dignity is a qualification of every human being independently of his or her social context. This may also mean that human dignity guarantees a place of intimacy in which every human being must be left alone. In a more concrete interpretation, this may provide for a space that is shielded from scrutiny by the state or other persons: intimate notes in diaries are one example, a collection of traces on the Internet that allows reconstruction of a whole personality may be another.

<sup>15</sup> For a good reflection: Lea Ypi, 'Self-ownership and the State: a democratic critique', *Ratio* 24: 1 (2011), 91-106.

<sup>16</sup> BVerfGE 4, 1, for a sharp critique from the perspective of individualistic Protestant theology: Graf. 17 For a close analysis: Dietmar von der Pfordten, *Menschenwurde, Recht und Staat bei Kant* (Paderborn, Mentis Verlag, 2009). Even an author like Rosen, critical of a legislative approach to human dignity, never wonders in his analysis of Kant how the important distinction between moral and legal philosophy relates to the application of human dignity as a legal instrument.

We saw that the second understanding posits that human dignity refers to the ability to participate in a social environment. It is the possibility of socializing in the widest sense that is protected by human dignity here. In this interpretation, the old feudal meaning of dignity, which may have played an important role for the different developments of the legal concept in and outside continental Europe, 18 comes to the fore. In this understanding, dignity protects the conditions of social recognition by others. Or, to use an old-fashioned word, it protects the honour of everybody, allowing them to expect a certain respect from all other members of the community. Concrete examples of this kind of protection include the guarantee of a minimum standard of living that exceeds what is needed for mere survival, or the justification of the prohibition of consented yet demeaning treatment, such as the French case of dwarf-throwing, or those of demeaning caricatures in Germany. 19

The extent to which these two interpretations of human dignity contradict or even mutually reinforce each other is a difficult and highly contested question of political philosophy. Maybe it takes an autonomous subject to become a functioning social persona and vice versa. One could also read this discussion as a version of the debate between liberals and communitarians, which in a certain way is the Anglo-American sequel to the argument between Kantians and Hegelians. But this is not our problem here. Often, lawyers can and should ignore the underlying fundamental issue in favour of the concrete problem. And, as we have already seen, at least in our case there is a conflict between the spheres of two different persons, who, indeed, brings to light the contradicting interpretations of their claim to human dignity that cannot be understood as mutually reinforcing. In other words, in this case human dignity plays a zero-sum game. While the victim needs the protection of his or her social persona, which is threatened by its inaccurate depiction on the Internet, the perpetrator needs a room of privacy that is, at least, protected even if he commits a crime within it. A solution that has to take sides for only one of the two persons is obviously easy to find. But this misses, as we have seen, the very problem ofthe case. We have already noted that every decision of the case that has a specific legal relevance for the victim, and not just a normative-symbolic meaning for the legal community, must use sanctions that allow the perpetrator to be identified. But every technique of identification would have problematic implications for the status of the perpetrator as well as for the whole legal community: it would require a potentially complete de-anonymization of online communication and state authority to seize it.

The scope of such a system of control would not only be remarkable; it would also strike directly at the second understanding of human dignity, which seeks to provide everybody with a space of his or her own. The monitoring of a person's entire online activity could produce a complete picture of his or her personality, including the most intimate details and an overview of the person's daily life that could match the most precise and frank autobiography. One might therefore argue, as has been done, that such a regulation could in itself violate human dignity: in the words of the German Federal Constitutional Court reviewing the European Data Retention Directive and referring to human dignity: 'That the use of liberty by the citizens must not be detected and registered in total belongs to the constitutional identity of the Federal Republic of Germany. ' 20 It seems that both understandings of human dignity clash in this case, private autonomy versus the social persona-but they can only clash if there is not only a normative assessment of the facts of the case but also a normative obligation to act. This leads us to our next question.

# The relational question: subjective right or objective value?

So far, we have discussed a normative tension within the substantive scope of human dignity. We have assumed that from the perspective of the victim the social persona is at risk, but have also noticed that a regime of sanctions could in this case lead to a likewise grave and broad loss of rights that belong to the perpetrator's and third person's human dignity. We did not, however, pose the question of whether the violation of human dignity ,should require such a sanction. The idea that rights provide not only a space of freedom but also include a state duty to protect is common to some human rights systems but unknown to others. As we have seen, in our case the ECtHR endorsed a strong duty to protect, deducing from the right to privacy a rather broad regime of supervision by the state.

The question of protection adds a second tension to the concept of human dignity. Apart from the question of its substantive meaning, there appears the question of the scope of the right. We will present two different ways to frame this problem:

1. The objective effect of a right creates new obligations and may also serve as a justification to abridge the rights of a third party. This is nothing new to the doctrine of human dignity.21 But why can we refer in our case to

21 McCrudden, 'Human dignity and judicial interpretation of human rights', 702-5.

<sup>20</sup> BVerfGE 125, 260 (324).

an objective effect of the right in question? A subjective right entitles a legal subject in relation to another person who is correspondingly obligated by this right. In our case, the victim's right to privacy, in the reading of the Court, obliges the state to intervene in a course of action attributed to a third person, for whom the state is not responsible.22 The case gives no strong reasons for this interpretation. It is presented instead as a self-evident move, though this is neither true for the comparative law of human rights nor for the jurisprudence of the ECtHR, which makes mixed and unsystematic use of an objective interpretation ofbasic rights.

Only an objective reading of the right to privacy allows an obligation of the state *to abridge the rights* of the perpetrator (and of every other participant in online communications). Obviously, this is a demanding and not unproblematic reading of a right. It destroys the asymmetry between the empowered individual persons and the state in favour of a more complex and less individualistic construction. It is one of the ironies of this approach that on the one hand it may claim to give an especially broad effect to human dignity, but that on the other hand it leads inevitably to a balancing approach in its application that has to define the scope of human dignity in relation to other claims. This is not the place to endorse or criticize balancing, 23 but it is clear that a broad interpretation of human dignity that permits case constellations in which two persons claim their right to human dignity at one another's expense excludes an absolute interpretation of this right. 24

The same point can be made with regard to the distinction between values and rules. If human dignity is part of a legal order and not just a moral demand, does it take the form of a rule or a principle, respectively a value? An important part of the post-war jurisprudence of basic rights on both sides of the Atlantic has tried to establish models of rights as principles, not as rules.25 Amongst the complicated arguments for this understanding, the higher normative rank of principles compared with other legal norms and the specific methodological approach their interpretation requires seem to be the most

25 Most notably Ronald Dworkin, *Taking Rights Seriously* (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1977), and Robert Alexy, *Theorie der Grundrechte* (Frankfurt am Main, Suhrkamp, 1986), though both with attempts that lead (allegedly for purely jurisprudential reasons) to differing results that come quite close to their respective own national legal orders.

<sup>23</sup> Ralf Poscher, 'The principles theories. How many theories and what is their merit?', in M. Klatt (ed.), *Institutionalized Reason* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012), 218-47.

<sup>24</sup> The way this tension is solved in German law, where both objective effect and absoluteness of human dignity is claimed, seems rather like a trick. Human dignity is often interpreted 'in connection with' another right that can be balanced. Critical: Mollers, 'Democracy and human dignity-limits of a moralized conception of rights in German constitutional law'.

important. For our context, it is crucial to observe an asymmetric relation between two systematic questions: though it does not seem to be necessary that a model of rights as principles implies an objective and balancing interpretation of this right (Dworkin's theory is the counter-example), the same is not true vice versa. Any objective and balancing understanding of rights can hardly conceive of them as rules: rules have the form of a conditional sentence in which there is hardly room for a balancing test. 26

For our case, the question of whether the ECtHR treated the right of privacy as a rule or a principle cannot be answered easily. One of the remarkable features of this decision is that it argues as if a rule were applied, though what the court actually did looks rather like an incomplete form of balancing: Without much of a legal argument, the Court devised a duty for the state to sanction a violation. But in accepting this duty the court had to introduce a second individual person into the legal argument, a person who also can claim Convention rights, the perpetrator. Therefore, the Court should have taken into account the rights of the perpetrator. In fact, these rights are part of an implicit balancing effort by the Court in which their weight equals zero. Again it is important to see that the form of the balanced value is at least not open to an approach that assumes an absolute protection through a certain right.27 That may lead to the perverse effect, for example in German constitutional law, that for the assessment of the human dignity of a given person, the normative demands of other persons may be more important than his or her own consent.28

There is a second aspect to our point. One neglected problem of human rights theory is how to coherently sanction its violation. If human dignity is considered to be a particular right that enjoys a central position in a system of legal guarantees or even a normatively higher rank than other rights, should it not be protected more aggressively? Or should its violation not be sanctioned more harshly than the violation of other rights?

Normally, in constitutional orders in which rights are protected, the violation of a right is not necessarily sanctioned beyond the mere invalidation of this violation. A violation of my freedom of speech entitles me to a remedy that ends the infringement, but not necessarily to any other sanction. The ECtHR's reading of Article 8 of the ECHR is, therefore, not self-evident: if there had been no instrument to stop the posting of the victim's name, this would have

<sup>27</sup> For an Alexian reading of the German human dignity clause see Nils Teifke, *Das Prinzip Menschenwilrde* (Tiibingen, Mohr Siebeck, 2011).

<sup>28</sup> Critical: Rosen, *Digniry,* 107.

been a problem of an appropriate remedy. But it does not seem equally compelling that every violation demands a positive legal sanction beyond this.

But maybe there are particular demands for specific violations of human rights. That this could be correct becomes plausible when we regard the rights to life and bodily integrity, which are protected by many national and international human rights catalogues. A violation of the right to life, the killing of a person, is de facto universally and severely sanctioned by private and criminal law, though only in certain qualified circumstances (responsible action of the perpetrator), and not or rarely in others (state of war beyond specific war crimes and crimes against humanity). One of the open problems of the legal doctrine of human dignity is the uncertain relation between the alleged rank of the right, the subjective necessity of sanctioning any intentional violation of it, and the severity of this sanction in relation to other sanctions. If torture is a violation of human dignity (which, within the very contested interpretation of its meaning, is perhaps the least contested case), and if human dignity can even be a higher ranking right than human life, than it seems plausible that the sanction of an intended violation of human dignity has to be at least as harsh as the sanction of an intended violation of life, that is, some kind of murder.

For our case this could mean that an appropriate sanction of the perpetrator would be in the range of the sanction of a murder. But this seems somewhat counter-intuitive, and this intuition is probably confirmed by much of the practice of criminal law, which does not recognize a crime that specifically violates human dignity. Even in Germany, in the constitutional order that seems to hold the protection of human dignity in the highest regard as an element of the unalterable core of the constitutional order, the same intuition is at work. It was generally acceptable, and not even a matter of public debate, that a person who had violated the human dignity of another person, as happened in the case of a police officer who threatened to torture a suspect (Daschher), was given only a relatively mild sentence for a minor physical injury. 29 The normative dissonance between this practice and the alleged rank of human dignity leads to a more general point. The connection between the protection of a right and the sanctioning of its violation is, perhaps for good reasons, rather weak. But many legal philosophers from Gustav Radbruch to Robert Alexy liked to identify the degree of unjustness of a flagrant violation of human rights by states like Nazi or East Germany with the injustice of these violations remaining unsanctioned. This is an approach one could call the remedial fallacy: though it is gravely unjust to intentionally kill somebody

<sup>29</sup> Mild beyond the additional justification that his threat had the aim to save the life of an abducted child.

and probably also unjust not to sanction the killer, any flat identification of the degree of injustice of the one deed with the other omission seems implausible. Obviously, the deed is morally worse than the omission.

If it is not necessary to sanction every intentional violation of a right for the sake of respecting this right, and if we see a legal practice at work that tends to sanction violations of human dignity less severely than other rights violations, then we might wonder how this reflects on the status of this guarantee compared with other rights.

Finally, we have already seen that in a strictly Kantian (probably as well as in a convincing Christian) reading, human dignity cannot be violated. Has the victim in our case, or any other victim of cruelty or a specifically degrading behaviour, lost his or her dignity? This seems dubious. At least in a moral sense, this would do too much honour to the perpetrator. 30 But if a legal reading of human dignity depends on at least some legal implications, we might deduce a more general conclusion. While an objective interpretation of human dignity, including a duty to protect, leads to a weaker concept of its substance, it is already a *legal* reading that must accept something that does not necessarily have to be: that humans can lose their dignity, and that this loss must be sanctioned by law.

### The practical question: general rights and specific cases

One of the key assumptions in the discourse on human dignity is that it serves as a kind of incompletely theorized agreement,31 as the expression of a consensus agreed upon for differing or even contradictory reasons. The post-war constellation on the international level and in many states in which secularists and the devout, Westerners and Easterners, capitalists and communists, had to formulate common founding documents is the most important example of this form of compromise. Given that this reconstruction reveals a historical experience, the question remains of what it means for the practice of the law,

<sup>30</sup> This is, by the way, what a close reading of the German codification of human dignity means: 'The dignity of the human being is untouchable *(unantastbar).* It cannot be violated.' The framers of the *Grundgesetz* did not suggest the same with regard to freedom of speech or the right to life and bodily integrity. It entails the argument that human dignity was meant as a moral ass11mption for the following rights, not as a right itself. The framers seemed to have a more nuanced concept of the relation between law and morals than the moralizing constitutional court following them. A good historical account is Christoph Goos, *Innere Freiheit: Eine Rekonstruktion des grundgesetzlichen Wurdebegriffs*  (Giittingen, Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2011).

<sup>31</sup> Cass R. Sunstein, *Legal Reasoning and Political C01iflict* (Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1998).

particularly for the decision of cases. What is the incomplete theory in this reconstruction? What reasons are beyond such a theory, and how do they relate to each other?

The considerable difference between the political process of finding a compromise formula for an international treaty or a constitution and the decision of a controversial case seems to escape this description. A look at Cass Sunstein's concept of incompletely theorized agreements (a jurisprudential version of John Rawls's idea of an overlapping consensus) may illustrate the point. It is far from clear that the reference to human dignity in a judicial decision is really an incomplete agreement in his sense. When the framers of a constitution decide to enshrine Sunday in the constitution as a holiday, they may do so following an agreement between Christian Churches and trade unions. This agreement is incompletely theorized as both parties have completely different, either spiritual or social, motives. But the result is uncontested, and the meaning of the resulting rule clear. When human dignity became a part of constitutions and international treaties, there was an agreement on the expression 'human dignity', but certainly none on its meaning for deciding concrete cases. And would it not be strange if a formula meant to convey an uncontroversial term into a controversial context could be used to decide concrete cases in an uncontroversial manner? In fact, the reference to human dignity instead of a more concrete less fundamental rule in order to solve a case just seems like the kind of fully fledged theoretical argument that Sunstein recommends be avoided.

It is, therefore, no accident that the universal acceptance of human dignity did not lead to common results. 32 To name just two examples from the western hemisphere: some states have outlawed capital punishment as a violation of human dignity, others practise it; some states see the right to abortion as part of women's dignity, but at least one state deduces from human dignity a duty to criminalize abortion.

These contradictions are well known and well documented.33 The question is how they can be reconciled with the idea of a core meaning and a peripheral variation.34 It seems they cannot. The concept of a consensual centre and a peripheral contestation fails if we can identify contradictory meanings within the concept. If we accept that human dignity entails a duty to

<sup>32</sup> One Arendtian claim that could be developed at this point is that one needs a political community to effectively protect human rights, a claim that seems to be supported by much of human rights practice. In such a community, one may find a consensus for, for example, a more liberal or a more paternalistic concept of human dignity that works its way through cases.

<sup>33</sup> McCrudden, 'Human dignity and judicial interpretation of human rights', 697-8.

<sup>34</sup> McCrudden, 'Human dignity and judicial interpretation of human rights', 711.

protect that widens the scope of intrusion into individual rights, what 'limits to state action' might mean remains contested.35 If we accept that human dignity gives a right to a community identity, it is far from clear that it can serve as a universal category.

Our case may again serve as an illustration. To define a core concept, the question to be answered is: what is the common core of two differing interpretations of human dignity in which the first protects the social persona of the victim and the second protects the communicative intimacy of the perpetrator? No doubt a smart constitutional theorist could devise a formula to reconcile this contradiction, but exactly qua this reconciling propriety, such a formula could not help decide our case.

# The regulatory use of human dignity

The organizational sociologist Karl Weick once remarked that simplicity, precision, and generality of a scientific explanation can only be had in a mutual trade-off.36 The same is true for norms, and the use of human dignity in cases like ours may well serve to highlight this point. The inclusion of human dignity produces a high level of normative generality at the expense of precision, and it creates a remarkable demand for complexity in the legal argument. As a matter of regulatory strategy, this does not seem to be a good road to take. While it may be important to make the concept of human dignity serve as a formula that designates a general underlying normative assumption of a constitutional order, it is something completely different to define such an assumption as the basis for the decision of cases. Finnish legislators had a regulatory concept when they limited access to certain data relevant to the prosecution of particular crimes. This concept may be contestable, but it seems to have looked at the different rights at stake. We can find such a finegrained solution neither in the ECHR nor in the reasoning of the ECtHR in our case. To be sure, one virtue of human rights is to offer simple solutions. There is nothing to say against an absolute protection of freedom of speech or an absolute prohibition of racist discrimination. But even though cases concerning these rights are often contested, the basic intuition in which direction the mentioned rights drive the legal argument is clear. The same is not true for the notion of human dignity. On the contrary, human dignity, as a master norm of constitutionalism, invites us to take a holistic approach; one that may be fine

for understanding the internal tensions of liberal constitutionalism, one that gives both actors in our case, the victim as well as the perpetrator, their share of a right. But human dignity is definitely not the kind of norm that helps us to prevent states or private individuals from acting in a particular way. A legal order that attempts to outlaw a certain behaviour, like torture, by its officials and its citizens has to define this behaviour as precisely as possible. The reference to human dignity will not help fulfil this task.
