# **Human Rights, Human Dignity, and Human Experience**

#### *Paolo G. Carozza*

MY PERSPECTIVE IN THIS chapter is that of a legal scholar and of a lawyer formed primarily in the common law tradition of practical reasoning-that is, someone whose central preoccupation is with facts and cases, with the raw material of human experience, and with drawing out of those concrete circumstances certain practical implications regarding the most reasonable way to order our relationships towards justice and the common good. That methodological starting point is in fact an important one for the central claim that I want to propose here: that in critical ways the foundation oflaw's preoccupation with the protection and promotion of human dignity needs to be forged in the crucible of human experience. It is an argument against treating human dignity as an abstraction, at least insofar as the concept has implications for the legal recognition of human rights. Relying methodologically on human experience as the touchstone oflegal claims of human dignity has certain important implications for how we might structure global human rights law and how we can give content to it.

The very concrete claims of human dignity that are the daily fare of international human rights bodies are as varied as can be imagined. In my own direct experience as a member of one such institution, 1 many dignity claims were powerful and moving: the Peruvian mother of the disappeared; the Jamaican men kept indefinitely in overcrowded, small, dark, and unventilated police holding cells amid garbage and urine; the leader of the Paraguayan indigenous community whose children were dying from diarrhoea because they had no access to clean water. Some claims were far less compelling, such as the man who claimed that he had been subject to degrading treatment because his employer fired him for refusing to cut the long hair that was very

important to his personal aesthetic preferences.2 Still other cases were neither easy nor clear: how does one assess the claims of dignity of an infertile woman who deeply desires to be a mother but was prohibited by law from using the *in vitro* fertilization technology that would have made it possible for her to bear children? In each of these cases, and in many others very similar to them, the petitioners and their advocates not only made claims that their rights under the American Convention on Human Rights were infringed but also that their human dignity was threatened or violated. When we examine how legal actors and institutions, using the language and artifacts oflaw, have responded to this array of different circumstances, we do not find a theoretical discourse on human dignity (at least, not one that is explicit or extended), but decisions that have tangible consequences stemming from the choice to recognize and protect certain kinds of claims, or to deny them.

As the other chapters of this volume have made abundantly clear, the pervasive invocation of the concept of human dignity today is accompanied by a wealth of different ideas about the meaning and scope of dignity within the plurality of moral and legal traditions of the human family. Those differences can be profound, and can have dramatically different implications for how we understand and protect dignity in law, as even a very compressed comparative survey of contemporary law reveals. 3

At a very high level of generality, one can find human dignity invoked across legal systems of widely divergent traditions to denote two interrelated ideas: (a) an ontological claim that all human beings have an equal and intrinsic moral worth; and (b) a normative principle that all human beings are entitled to have this status of equal worth respected by others and also have a duty to respect it in all others. The normative principle includes withinit the obligations of the state to respect human dignity in its law and policy as well. Based on this core common meaning of human dignity, there .is broad consensus across legal systems that certain ways of treating other hum:in beings ought always to be prohibited by law. Prohibitions on genocide, slavery, torture, forced disappearance, and systematic racial discrimination, for instance, represent some important examples of universal acceptance of the implications

<sup>2</sup> Of course there are many other circumstances where the cutting of hair can often be the basis for a very serious claim that human dignity is as in the forcible shaving of a detainee's head for purposes of humiliation, or a requirement that a Sikh cut his hair in violation of his religious obligations, but no such deeply rooted dignity claims were presented here.

of the status and basic principle of human dignity. It is not surprising that in international human rights law many of these clearest instantiations of the requirements of human dignity also coincide with the strongest and exceptionless norms of international law, found for example in the definitions of crimes against humanity or *jus cogens.* 

In the same way, the most widespread and evident use of dignity in human rights adjudication can be found in cases dealing with the protection of life itself and the integrity (physical or mental) of human persons. Cases are legion where inhuman and degrading treatment is found to violate the inherent dignity of the victims, and references to the requirements of human dignity pervade the case law of virtually all systems in these areas.4

Beyond that hard minimal core of the meaning of human dignity, legal experience reveals several areas where the meaning and use of dignity has less universal resonance but still fairly broad recognition and acceptance across several different legal traditions and systems. For instance, in many different jurisdictions courts discuss dignity as a value central to the definition and protection of individuals' social status and social roles. The German and South African Constitutional Courts have fined authors and publishers or even banned books because, although presented as works of fiction, they shared too many details about a particular individual's private life, in violation of their dignity. 5 French courts frequently require newspapers to pay damages after they publish stories or photographs about individuals without respect for their dignity. 6 This conception of dignity is not quite universal, however, and seems to be primarily employed within European courts and associated with the distinctively European conceptions of privacy (which are often quite different from those prevalent in the USA, for instance). Another group of cases shows certain courts employ dignity to address the sweeping conditions that shape the lives of entire communities living in poverty and extreme vulnerability. One sees this developed very clearly in the Inter-American human

rights system's cases on the 'right to a dignified life' of indigenous peoples,7 or in the Constitutional Court of South Africa's decision requiring the government to devote substantial resources to developing and carrying out a plan to progressively realize the right to adequate housing. 8 Such situations involving the dignity of excluded groups are also related to the use of human dignity in cases invoking equality as necessary to the respect for human dignity in general. Based on the proposition that all people are inherently and equally entitled to human dignity, this view is especially developed in Canadian jurisprudence, has become common in South Africa, and can be found in some other jurisdictions as welU

The partial overlap of understandings of dignity in these several areas shades to even greater disagreement as we approach those questions that touch on fundamentally contested visions of the meaning and destiny of human life, and especially the meaning and nature of freedom. At some level, almost all jurisdictions wrestle in complicated ways with the right relationship of dignity to autonomy, but there is no clear consensus even within single legal systems, let alone across different traditions. From one perspective, human dignity clearly demands protection of individual autonomy. For instance, many jurisdictions ground the autonomy of patients to make free and informed choices about their medical care in human dignity, 10 and a government that does not respect people's choices to shape their identities can thereby violate their dignity.11 Yet, in contrast to that use of dignity, which empowers people to make free choices, dignity also plays a role in empowering government to *limit* the personal choices of their citizens. The French prohibition on dwarf-throwing is the most famous example of this, 12 but others abound. In Germany, a prohibition on peep shows has been found to be a valid protection of the

human dignity of the (consenting) women being exhibited, 13 while the South African Constitutional Court upheld a ban on prostitution because the commodification of one's body necessarily diminished the human dignity of the prostitutes. 14 At times, this internal contradiction in the relationship between dignity and autonomy manifests itself dramatically. Even when safeguarding the dignity of having free choices, law frequently tempers autonomy by placing some restrictions on those choices that may be necessary to safeguard the dignity of others. 15

At or even beyond the furthest margins of consensus over dignity, we find cases in which different courts, and indeed different judges within the same court, rely on human dignity to come to two entirely different conclusions even when dealing with strongly similar situations. Some of the most obvious examples include cases surrounding the beginning and end of human lifeabortion and euthanasia or assisted suicide-as has been richly illustrated by the variety of perspectives on these issues found elsewhere in this book.

In short, there is a practical consensus around a core meaning of human dignity, lesser but discernible convergences of understanding around a cluster of key questions, values, and circumstances that are related to dignity, and some sharp disagreements and even contradictions that reflect not only the variety of intellectual and moral traditions in which the concept has its roots but also differences in the specific political, social, and cultural contexts in which the very broad principle gets instantiated. Probably the most persistent tensions have to do with those cases that inescapably deal with the relationship between dignity and competing notions of individual freedom, and with arguments about who counts as a human being with equal and inherent moral worth (e.g., the unborn or the terminally ill).

A problem then arises from the fact that the label 'dignity' gets used so broadly that it elides the differences between the core areas of practical agreement and the (sometimes intensely) disputed uses of dignity at or beyond the margins of consensus. That ambiguity is what allows use of the normative principle of human dignity to be so vulnerable to charges of inconsistency and even incoherence, and even to ideological manipulation. Where the term 'dignity' in fact tacitly reflects a particular view of human nature and human fulfilment-say, the difference between a neo-Kantian emphasis on radical

<sup>15</sup> In most instances, when the conflict between dignity-as-liberty and dignity-as-constraint appears, the issue is not necessarily two competing definitions of dignity but rather the competing dignities of two different people whose interests may collide. This helps unravel the otherwise puzzling ability of courts to rely on dignity in support of either side of the abortion divide.

autonomy and a Judaeo-Christian vision of human freedom as intrinsically oriented towards relationship with others-arguments based on an unelaborated assertion of' dignity' simply mask the differences. Whether intentionally or only passively, the language of dignity becomes a vehicle for the surreptitious imposition of one profoundly contested vision of human nature and human destiny over another.

That dynamic brings us, over and over again, to an impasse. How can we arrive at a more widely understood and shared conception of dignity, such that we can broaden the ways in which the law becomes a tool for protecting and realizing it, without running aground on the rocks of incommensurable moral and intellectual premises? We seem to be lacking the capacity to move forward.

We might be tempted to conclude that dignity as a legal concept is either trivial (in the sense of being so self-evident and undisputed that it adds nothing to the discussion-say, in the case of torture or slavery), or else so irreconcilably contested as to be useful only within very circumscribed and homogenous communities of discourse, if at all. If so, it might be better simply to reject it as vacuous and/or quite dangerous. 16 If we take that road, though, in reality we are also rejecting the good and important functions of the status and principle of human dignity. The ontological claim of human dignity helps sustain the very possibility of human rights as global that can and should help us condition sovereignty and hold accountable those who abuse power, especially the power of the state. Human dignity represents the ideal that there is a certain unity to the human person in which conflicting claims of rights need to be balanced and reconciled. The recognition of the equal worth of human persons is, today, the only widely shared suprapositive value with which positive law and legal systems worldwide are reasonably judged and critiqued. In short, without a commitment to the idea of human dignity, human rights law as it has been painstakingly constructed over the last seventy years would not exist.

This reminder of the connection of human dignity to· the foundations of human rights law in general might also begin to suggest a way for us to take a step beyond the impasse. We find there a strong parallel ·between the problem of human dignity and the structural problem at the origin of international human rights law itself. To draw this out, we can first recapitulate

<sup>16</sup> See, for example, Mirko Bagaric and James Allan, 'The vacuous concept of dignity', *Journal of Human Rights* 5 (2006), 257-70; Justin Bates, 'Human dignity-an empty phrase in search of meaning?', *Judicial Review* 10 (2005), 165-8.

very briefly two well-established premises about contemporary international human rights.

First, at a conceptual level, human rights, in a way that is not dissimilar to what we see with human dignity, is not a single coherent idea, but represents the intersection of a variety of different traditions of thought, which in various degrees have mutually incompatible premises, especially premises about the nature and destiny of the human personY This deep divergence of foundational premises was of course recognized from the beginning of the attempt to forge an international agreement on human rights in the mid-twentieth century, but-and here is the second of the background features of human rights that needs to be highlighted-the whole international human rights project was constructed on the basis of a deliberate abstention from strong agreement about foundational principles. The generation of jurists, scholars, and politicians who drew up and secured approval for the Universal Declaration of Human Rights knew very well that they all came to the discussion with profoundly incompatible first principles. 18 The basis for their consensus on a declaration of basic human rights was not a substantive agreement about foundations nor the discovery of a transcendent global ethic that unified them. Rather, their project was based on a more modest and limited aim: to reach a practical consensus on the articulation of human rights while setting aside the goal of attaining any thicker consensus about where those rights come from and why we should regard them as pertaining to human persons. The human rights enterprise is built on practical agreement, *tout court.* 

Whenever he was asked how it was possible that adherents of such radically opposed philosophies could reach agreement on a declaration of fundamental rights, Jacques Maritain-himself a Catholic, Thomist philosopher, and diplomat who was heavily involved in the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights-liked to say, 'Yes, we agree about the rights, but on conoition that no one asks us why. It is with the "why" that all the disagreements begin.' 19 Maritain and his colleagues did not regard this lack of consensus on foundations as fatal to the project. The fact that an agreement could be achieved across cultures on several practical principles was 'enough', Maritain wrote, 'to enable a great task to be undertaken' .20

And, in fact, in the subsequent history of the human rights movement, that practical consensus has allowed for the construction of an impressive human rights edifice. Because we have a positive acceptance of a list of rights, the human rights movement has largely been able to focus on the practical work of 'translating' human rights into positive legal norms, formal international and constitutional instruments, and an institutional system, and then on the practical work of securing universal agreement to all that. This approach has had enormous success by many important measures. The crisis of humanity that was represented by the totalitarian movements of the twentieth century, and their violation of the most fundamental principles of justice and dignity on a massive scale, made clear the need to articulate certain universal basic principles of accountability. The genesis of the international human rights-movement thus did respond to a genuine and profound human need and desire, and the strategy of practical agreement allowed a response to that need to emerge. Today, in consequence, there exists a certain core of rights that are basically recognized and accepted across a broad array of different political, economic, religious, and cultural realities, regardless of concurrent differences in any theoretical justification of them. There are national, regional, and global tutions whose work is sincerely, and sometimes influentially, directed towards promoting and protecting those fundamental rights, regardless of the divergent traditions to which they are being applied.

What does all this imply for the possibility of going forward in building a common understanding of human dignity? One immediately evident conclusion is that the arguments and difficulties about dignity are nothing other than the replication at a more general level of the same 'unfinished business' offounda1iions that is at the heart ofthe human rights project.21 Human rights instruments bracket foundational questions but universally invoke human dignity as a generic placeholder for the something that gives human rights a deeper justificatory source.22 But that only ensures that the underlying disagreement is semantically shifted from the foundation and meaning of human rights to the foundation and meaning of human dignity.

If it is true that we are facing the same structural problem, should we adopt a structurally analogous strategy to address it? Should there be (for purposes oflaw) a limited focus on whatever practical agreement can be identified around the principle of human dignity, abstaining from engaging and

<sup>21</sup> The phrase 'unfinished business' is borrowed from Mary Ann Glendon, 'Foundations of human rights: the unfinished business', *American Journal of Jurisprudence* 44 ( 1999), 1-14.

deploying more fully theorized accounts about the status of dignity, where it comes from, and in what it consists? There is some merit in that proposal, and it begins to get at what I am trying to suggest in saying that we need to turn to concrete human experience in order to gain a fuller understanding of the meaning and implications of human dignity. One could even imagine that it might generate a great deal of constructive convergences in those areas where there are already the conditions present for a fairly large overlap among various understandings of dignity-the relationship of the principle of dignity to the need to protect persons from all forms of cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment, for example.

But it is not yet enough. The strategy of practical consensus of Maritain and his contemporaries, for all its outward success, also suffers from some serious weaknesses and limitations. I have tried to diagnose them more fully elsewhere, so I will not rehearse the criticism in detail again here.23 In synthesis, though, we can point to a number of persistent problems with the international human rights project that are all traceable in some degree to the thinness of the practical agreement on which it rests. It contributes to the wide and enduring gap between the formal international legal norms and instruments of human rights law on the one hand and the local social, political, and cultural realities in which they are supposed to be operative in practice on the other. It also ignores the fact that positive law, alone and without deeper ethical sources within a society, is insufficient to sustain the relationships of justice and solidarity and commitments to the common good to which we aspire. Both of these reasons contribute in some important degree to the very high degrees of non-compliance that we find in virtually all systems of international human rights law. Third, the absence of thicker substantive agreement about the sources and meaning of human rights has left a vacuum which has often been filled by bureaucracy and proceduralism. Finally and most importantly, in tlie end it is impossible to avoid, at least passively, making judgements and decisions on the basis of the deeper and more contested premises about the nature of the human person and the meaning of human life. Acknowledging practical agreement alone only obscures the deeper differences that in fact persist. Whenever we are faced with difficult judgements about, for example, the existence or recognition of a human right, its extension into new spheres and its relationship to other rights, its permissible limitations, we are implicitly relying on any number of prior assumptions about the person, society, the

state, freedom, law, and so on. Bracketing the underlying assumptions doesn't make them disappear, it only makes them less transparent, and therefore less subject to reasoned discussion and debate.

Maritain and his contemporaries knew this, and in fact said clearly that consensus around a limited set of practical principles did not obviate the more difficult task of seeking greater common understanding of the underlying reasons and foundations of human rights. The strategy of practical agreement, the philosopher Richard McKeon stressed, would merely provide a 'framework within which divergent philosophical, religious, and even economic, social and political theories might be entertained and developed'. 24 In other words, for the drafters and intellectual supporters of the Universal Declaration, the focus on practical agreement on principles and institutions was merely a method for moving beyond the roadblock of incommensurable premises. It was not presumed to be a sufficient permanent basis for the recognition and protection of universal human rights. Instead, it was to be a provisional and partial overlap of commitments on the basis of which we would need to work (hard) towards a deeper understanding of basis of that practice. At best, the effort to reach practical agreement was a method to provoke, to force open, a more vital debate about the foundations too.

Turning back to the present predicament of human dignity, then, what can we conclude on the basis of seven decades of experience pursuing a strategy of limited practical consensus on universal human rights? Focusing on our concrete human experiences of human dignity, and the convergences that we can find there, might be a very fruitful way forward; not, however, merely as a way of seeking practical agreement while setting aside the deeper and more difficult task of seeking a common substantive understanding of the meaning and requirements of human dignity. Focusing on our human .experience of dignity cannot be the end point of our efforts but must rather be the *beginning* of a sustained and critical method of reasoning together, about which understandings of dignity, among the many deeply divergent approaches, corresponds best-which is to say most completely, most universally, most reasonably-to the reality of human life in all its complexity.

What is needed, then, is not only a focus on our shared concrete human experience of dignity but a focus that opens up the possibility of critical reasoning about how that experience of dignity deepens our understanding of what it is to be human, to have value, or, most to the point, to have a common, irreducible, and universal value as human persons. One can call this sort of

shared and critical experience, taking up the suggestion of Luigi Giussani, 'elementary experience' .25

As Giussani explains:

What constitutes this original, elementary experience? It can be described as a complex of needs and 'evidences' which accompany us as we come face to face with all that exists. Nature thrusts man into a universal comparison with himself, with others, with things, and furnishes him with a complex of original needs and 'evidences' which are tools for that encounter. So original are these needs or these 'evidences' that everything man does or says depends on them ...

The need for goodness, justice, truth, and happiness constitutes man's ultimate identity, the profound energy with which men in all ages and of all races approach everything, enabling them to an exchange, of not only things, but also ideas, and transmit riches to each other over the distance of centuries. We are stirred as we read passages written thousands of years ago by ancient poets, and we sense that their works apply to the present in a way that our day-to-day relations do not. If there is an experience of human maturity, it is precisely this possibility of placing ourselves in the past, of approaching the past as if it were near, a part of ourselves. Why is this possible? Because this elementary experience, as we stated, is substantially the same in everyone, even if it will then be determined, translated, and realized in very different different, in fact, that they may seem opposed.26

This 'complex of needs and evidences' characterizes what is irreducibly human in all of us, what moves us to act, and what propels us into a dynamic relationship with all of reality. It is something more basic, more fundamentally constitutive of our humanity than any of the multitude of specific cultural artifacts (including law) could be. It is part of what we presuppose, even unconsciously, whenever we say 'I' in a serious, self-aware wayY

There is much more to be said to develop and unpack that concept than I could do justice to here, but let me be quick to say what the appeal to elementary experience is *not.* It is not a new anthropological theory or a new theory oflaw or natural law; it is not a set of moral precepts to order human affairs; it is not a generic idea of humanity. It is something distinct from (even if inevitably related to) both theory and culture, and it inheres in the human being as a fact. It is a form of experience of what is human in which the evidence that

we run up against thrusts us into a comparison with our own needs desires, · our own nature, our 'I'. 28

This is not to suggest, of course, that elementary experience isn't translated inevitably into judgements, theories, and values, and together with other persons translated also into cultural projects, including law. But the connection to law must not be 'short-circuited', as Carmine DiMartino has written: 'We have to avoid the short circuit between the list of fundamental rights and the universal structure of experience. The irreducibility of the latter, continuously sought after by reason in an indomitable attentiveness to experience, necessarily demands a critical vigilance, even in the face of so-called universal rights. ' 29 Or to put this point in another way, despite the way that we talk about the universality human rights, it is not really the rights that are universal so much as the human is, and the universality of rights follows from the prior universality of the human. 30 But the meaning of human here is not based on the abstract definition or some a priori anthropological or metaphysical claim. Our awareness of what is human emerges in experience, an experience· capable of a critical judgement of what corresponds to what is irreducibly . human-that is, in elementary experience.

And so it is with dignity, then: the meaning of dignity, if not consigned to the fragmented and incoherent babel of approaches that we. see about us, if not reduced to whatever the conventional mentalities of the day inculcate upon us, if not blocked by the schematic opposition of conflicting theories and ideological prescriptions, has to emerge first from an encounter with what is most elementary to our humanity, an encounter that educates us to see in ourselves and in the other what is the worth, the value, the dignity of the human.

To bring this back to concrete cases, let me illustrate the method of elementary experience for a few moments by reference to some of the same real-life examples of dignity claims mentioned in passing at the outset of this chapter, and by reference to the way that I, as human subject, related to them. All of those cases-the mother of the disappeared, the indigenous leader, the infertile woman seeking help-presented me with the. challenge of trying to grasp and enter into not just the technical questions of how the treaty norms might or might not apply to the case in question. More than that, they posed the challenge ofhow to enter into the human dimensions of the problem. What was I supposed to say to a woman whose son had disappeared, whose heart was crying out for justice, or to the woman who came to us out of the anguish

of not being able to conceive? Clearly, I could not pretend to be able to satisfy their needs, in any real or comprehensive sense. How could I even begin to understand the dimensions of the problem of the indigenous people of the Chaco, deprived of the very foundations of their cultural integrity and reduced to raising their children in a narrow strip of dry earth between the highway and the barbed wire that kept them out of their ancestral lands? Before being legal problems, these were problems that demanded a deep sympathy, not in a trite sentimental sense but in the sense of recognizing in their suffering the authenticity of their desires, and seeing in it the evidence of a universal need in which one becomes aware of the constitutive factors of one's own self as well as of the humanity of the other. In a phrase, the recognition of their human dignity emerged as elementary experience. Even more starkly illustrative of this dynamic was the day in which we visited the Jamaican police holding cell I referred to earlier. Immediately after that, I also paid a visit to a residential community of a religious order known as the Missionaries of the Poor. Here the brothers welcome into their care some of the most despised and outcast members of the Jamaican society: people suffering from AIDS, typically in advanced stages of the syndrome's development, and acutely disabled children. The first group are rejected by society not only for the virus they carry but also because they are automatically presumed to be gay in a society rife with hatred and violence against homosexuals, where we documented instances in which the police stood by and watched as gays were beaten and their homes destroyed. The second group consisted of children whose physical deformities and mental handicaps were so severe that it was difficult not to avert one's eyes. What made a simple gaze on the lives of all these residents possible for me was seeing the exceptional love, care, attentiveness, and even joy that the brothers, and the volunteer doctors and the AIDS patients and children so evidently shared with one another. The contrast with the jail, just an hour earlier, was staggering-there, men were herded together and standing in garbage and urine; here, everything was treated with care, with attentiveness to beauty, with tranquillity. Both, in vividly contrasting ways, constituted the awareness of the meaning of human dignity for me: the first in which I could not fail to be struck by the blatant denial of the most elemental humanity of these ordinary men; the second in which I could not help but be moved by the human love that affirmed the inestimable value of each and every single one of the lives in the brothers' care.

What lessons can be drawn from all that? First of all, that human dignity, as the fruit of the method of elementary experience, is first of all something that is discovered, not something deduced from a theory or from an intellectual or ontological premise. It is something concretely encountered in an Other and recognized in oneself. And it emerges in particular in relationships of solidarity, of compassion (in the etymological sense), of gratuitousness. It is subjective, in the sense of inhering always in an embodied 'I' rather than in a disembodied discourse, yet it is in no way a relativistic thing; it is a hard fact. It is given, not made.

Can that elementary experience of the dignity of another (and of myself), with its inherently intimate relation to the particular human subject, also form the basis of a broader approach to dignity in law? In a way, focusing on the roots of our experience of dignity has moved us back towards the origins of law rather than removing us from relevance to law. Law, as a cultural practice that addresses certain basic human needs, draws on and responds to something that comes before it. So the method of elementary experience, as a way to comprehend and verify the meaning and implications of human dignity, certainly has relevance to the way that law ought to be structured to reflect and protect human dignity, and gives us a possible way to evaluate the law's effectiveness in securing that dignity. But, remembering DiMartino's cautionary observation cited earlier, we must not short-circuit the path from human experience to law, still less to specific rights and responsibilities. Even in the cases cited, the clear recognition of the ways in which the *status* of human dignity is indeed at stake, which allows us to enter into an important reflection on the right way to instantiate the *moral principle* of respect for human dignity, does not take us so far as to determine in any clear and unambiguous way how those cases ought to be decided as a matter of positive law. What kind of reparations should be due to the mother of the disappeared? Should the state be held directly responsible for the material conditions of the indigenous communities of the Chaco and the deaths of the children there? Does a recognition of the authentic expression of human dignity in the desire for biologicalmotherhood necessarily mean that access to new reproductive technologies are the right response, even when other human lives in embryonic form may be put at grave risk of instrumentalization and destruction? There are obviously several steps of reasoning, and many prudential judgements, that must be undertaken before getting from the experience of an authentic claim of human dignity to the formal way in which human rights law should recognize and protect it. For this reason, I emphasized earlier that the method of elementary experience does not itself propose, or even lead directly to, any specific theory of law, old or new.

Nevertheless, at a macro level the method of human experience could have at least a few fairly direct implications for how we treat human dignity in law.

First, it supports the idea that law, especially the global law of human rights, ought to seek and build on the existence of a practical consensus around

the status and principle of human dignity, just as Maritain and the generation of 1948 did in the forging of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. That consensus would look to the concrete experience of human dignity that is shared across broadly diverse forms of human culture.

Second, we ought to be very cautious and restrained in the use of the concept of dignity in the law in ways that generate new rights or aggressively new understandings of rights, for it is more likely than not that these are not reflections of shared experience but instead assertions of contested, abstracted, and often ideologically charged theories of dignity.

Third, where there are sharply divergent understandings of dignity at issue, instead of bracketing and closing the disagreement, setting it to one side, we ought to use disagreement as a provocation to break open the discussion about the meaning and consequences of dignity. In other words, it is entirely good and right that the discourse oflaw (as represented not only by judges but also by citizens, advocates, scholars, and legislators) should engage in serious and sustained debate about dignity, seeking always to ground it in fact and experience, and asking what most genuinely corresponds to the most original needs and evidences of our common human nature.

Fourth, where there is not a strong practical agreement, grounded in concrete experience, we should tolerate, and indeed embrace, a generous pluralism of understandings across cultures and legal systems. The risk of a hegemonic imposition of one idea of dignity is great. Human rights, as expressions of some of the specific moral principles that flow from a recognition of the status of human dignity, therefore, need in important ways to protect the conditions for a thick and pluralistic discourse on questions of human dignitythus, protecting the integrity of diverse ways oflife, forms of human association, expression, and participation.

Fifth, there needs to be a special regard for the role that religious freedom, religious pluralism, and interreligious dialogue will play in generating the conditions for a thicker understanding of human dignity to emerge from elementary experience. The method I have described and proposed emphasizes the generative value of solidarity, compassion, love, and gratuitousness in human relationships, as well as the critical role played by our capacity for increased self-awareness in an encounter with an irreducible Other. All of these are among the everyday basic features of a wide variety of religious traditions. It is there, within them and among them, that we have some of the greatest cause for hope that we can find our way forward from the impasse in which we find ourselves now with respect to the meaning and implications of human dignity.
