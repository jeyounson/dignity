# PART II - Dignity Critiques

# **Dignity: The Case Against**

#### *Michael Rosen*

I GAVE THE BENEDICT LECTURES at Boston University on the subject of dignity in 2007. Shortly before the first lecture, I was talking to a leading moral philosopher I know. He regretted that he wouldn't be able to come to the lectures but wished me luck, and added: 'I hope you give it a good kicking'. Well, I don't think that I did that in those lectures or in the book that emerged from them, 1 so perhaps today is as good a time as any to remedy the omission.

Let me start, though, by noticing that my friend's animus against dignity is widely shared among philosophers, in my experience, and goes back a long way. Why should that be so?

This brings me to the first charge against dignity:

### Dignity is humbug

Schopenhauer put the idea with characteristic vigour:

That expression, *dignity of man,* once uttered by Kant, afterward became the shibboleth of all the perplexed and empty-headed moralists who concealed behind that imposing expression their lack of any real basis of morals, or, at any rate, of one that had any meaning. They cunningly counted on the fact that their readers would be glad to see themselves invested with such a *dignity*  and would accordingly be quite satisfied with it.2

A shibboleth is a kind of tribal password. Schopenhauer's objection to dignity, however, is that it is a deceptive facade. Although the word 'dignity' carries associations of grandeur and elevated status, where we would expect a substantial structure-the foundation for morality-there is, in fact, an empty space. The impressiveness of the facade diverts our attention from the vacuum behind it.

A few years ago, the University of Oxford in a piece of what all evidence suggests was quite inadvertent managerial brilliance instituted a system by which its overstretched and under-rewarded college fellows could apply for what it calls 'Titular Professorships' -a title which carries no financial benefit or reduction in burden. And yet, as it turned out, this chance to pin medals on one's own chest had considerable appeal to Oxford academics, and they (with the notable exception of the Philosophy Faculty, I should say) threw themselves into the practice with enthusiasm. This, or so Schopenhauer is suggesting, is how dignity functions.

Yet, even if dignity is a Potemkin village of vain pretensions, is it a good idea to expose it? The idea that illusions are essential to the political order runs through the Western tradition of political thought from Plato. According to Bacon, for example, even beneficent innovation in politics is to be distrusted, 'because it unsettles what is established; these things resting on authority, consent, fame and opinion, not on demonstration' .3

Nietzsche took this view. He believed4 that the 'brutal truth' that 'slavery is of the essence of culture' must be concealed by sentimental illusions such as 'the rights of man', 'equality', and the 'dignity oflabour':

> Such phantoms as the dignity of man, the dignity of labour, are the needy products of slavedom hiding itself from itself. Woeful time, in which the slave requires such conceptions, in which he is incited to think about and beyond himselfl Cursed seducers, who have destroyed the slave's state of innocence by the fruit of the tree of knowledge! Now the slave must vainly scrape through from one day to another with transparent lies recognizable to every one of deeper insight, such as the alleged 'equal rights of all' or the so-called 'fundamental rights of man', of man as such, or the 'dignity oflabour'. 5

Better, in other words, for a heartless world to seem to have a heart than for its heartlessness to be plainly apparent.

But is that so? One description I used above for dignity was 'facade' a significant metaphor, as it turns out. The idea that facades are false fronts, bogus and misleading, does not seem even to have entered speech before the beginning of the twentieth century. But the coming of architectural modernism-Loos's famous 'House without Eyebrows' on the Michaelerplatz in Vienna and his slogan 'Ornament is crime'-changed that. The force of the modernist revolt against facades was undoubtedly amplified by the First World War. The image of a thrusting modern, capitalist

<sup>3</sup> Bacon, *Novum Organum,* XC.

<sup>4</sup> Or, at least, believed in 1871, when he wrote the essay 'The Greek State'.

*<sup>5</sup>* 'The Greek State', in *Early Greek Philosophy and Other Writings,* trans. M.A. Miigge (New York, Russell & Russell, 1964), 4--5.

society concealed within buildings whose exteriors were presented within the static vocabulary of a nostalgic classicism parallels all too closely an industrialized war in which mass slaughter was carried on alongside the dignified flummery of emperors, hussars, and gallant, courtly ritual. Not only is the Nietzschean idea of philosophers as epistemic aristocrats a morally repellent form of arrogance, but, or so it seems, cynically sustaining illusory facades of dignity increases the destructiveness of the forces thereby concealed.

#### When everybody's somebody, nobody's anybody

Let me return now to Schopenhauer's suggestion. What gives dignity its imposing or impressive appearance? Earlier, I used the phrase 'grandeur or elevated status' -it wasn't accidental. If we look at the history of the word 'dignity', we notice that many of the words that are now translated into English as dignity were associated with rank and majesty-royal or divine.

Now one might argue that, if dignity is a matter of rank, then the attribution of dignity to human beings should not be measured by whether there is anything corresponding to it. It is a self-enacted status claim. Statuses are not God-given facts *(pace* Pope Leo XIII) but agreed social conventions. It is sufficient therefore that the status claim should be commonly accepted for it to be valid. 'Dignity' does not need to denote anything, just as (one might point out if in Wittgensteinian mood) there is no fact beyond social acceptance that underlies the piece with a horse's head being entitled to move in an 'L' -shape. At this point, however, a new objection to dignity presents itself. If there is nothing to dignity but conventional status, what significance can it still have to attribute to all human beings, just in virtue of being human, a status that was originally reserved only for a privileged portion of them? As the Grand Inquisitor says in Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Gondoliers,* 'when everybody's somebody then no one's anybody'.

But, of course, in the case ofSchopenhauer's quotation, something more *is* being indicated. The idea is that dignity offers a foundation, drawn from Kant, for that complex of humanitarian ideas about equality and human rights about which Nietzsche thought the nineteenth century needed to conceal the ugly reality. Let us call this the idea of dignity as an inner transcendental kernel; which hich brings me to a third charge against dignity.

### There is no inner transcendental kernel

What does Kant mean by dignity? It is important to realize that, for Kant, dignity is the name of a kind of value. All values fall into two classes, he says in the *Groundwork-'In* the kingdom of ends everything has either a *price*  or a *dignity'* (Ak. 4:434). While whatever has a price can be replaced by an equivalent, 'what ... is raised above all price and ... admits of no equivalent has a dignity' (Ak. 4:434). Only one thing has dignity, however, says Kant: 'morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, is that which alone has dignity' (Ak. 4:435). This, then, is our inner transcendental kernel.

The epistemological and metaphysical difficulties in the way of establishing the existence of such an inner transcendental kernel have made it a matter of philosophical controversy (British understatement). Here I want to ignore those difficulties to note one thing: even if we concede the existence of an inner transcendental kernel, it is not clear what follows from that regarding the way in which individuals should be treated or should behave.

### The inner transcendental kernel fails to guide our conduct

Consider. Dignity is something that inheres in me in virtue of my personhood. While it is possible to reason instrumentally about those things that have a 'price', my dignity cannot be increased or diminished, however I am treated. Indeed, according to Kant, dignity inheres in my *person,* not my physical body-it cannot even be destroyed by the loss of my life. So what possible guidance 'Could my possession of it give to moral decision-making?

Of course, Kant does think that he can offer a framework for decisionmaking, although what that is has also proved controversial (more understatement). The dominant view among contemporary Kantians-see, for example, Christine Korsgaard, Onora O'Neill, or Derek Parfit-is that Kant endorses a consent principle.6 But that cannot be right-unless Kant's claims about what particular ethical judgements follow from his principle are so flagrantly in contradiction with that principle as to beggar belief. What could be more obviously capable of being consented to than that people should have the right to end their own lives? Yet Kant denies this with a vehemence that would do credit to a Catholic bishop. Indeed, pretty much the same thing goes for all the duties that Kant considers as 'duties to oneself'. I have offered what I believe

<sup>6</sup> Parfit is not a Kantian-but he spends a huge effort elaborating what he claims to be the 'Kantian' principle of consent.

to be a superior interpretation of Kant's thought in my book, and shall not rehearse it here. I only note that it is a consequence of my interpretation that we shall look in vain in Kant for an objective algorithm for moral decisiontaking. If you want an equivalent to the utilitarian's greatest happiness principle, you will be disappointed, I believe.

Given all the difficulties and controversies surrounding Kant's moral philosophy, it is surprising that dignity should have become so prominent in modem law and political discourse. In the light of this, we might suspect that what is behind dignity is not just Kantianism. Which brings me to a fourth objection.

# Dignity is a Trojan horse for religiously inspired attacks on equality

The history of dignity and the history of Western Christianity are bound up with one another. Which is not at all surprising, of course, given how far the history of Western social thought has been, effectively, that of Christianity. Certainly, three of the most important historical strands of meaning for dignity (dignity as elevated social status; dignity as a status pertaining to human beings as such; and dignity as a form of speech and bearing that is 'dignified') can be found already in Cicero, but after that, it's pretty much Christianity all the way to the eighteenth century.

One effect of the Christian heritage has been to cast doubt on the status conception of dignity-sometimes in the form of the claim that dignity (worldly status) is of no value, and sometimes as the idea that there is another, truer, unworldly dignity, distinct from worldly status. What is important for my purpose now, however, is the idea of dignity as (in Aquinas's words in *On the Sentences)* 'something's goodness on account of itself' .7 Stretching back to Aquinas, then, is a view of dignity as intrinsic value, such that *anything* that is capable of having an intrinsic value has dignity. For Kant too, as we have seen, dignity is a matter of intrinsic value-but it is found only in 'morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality'. For Aquinas and his successors, however, dignity and human dignity are not co-extensive; many other kinds of being-including, indeed, abstract entities like thought or social relationships-are capable of having dignity.

In the nineteenth century-particularly under Pope Leo XIII-this Catholic dignity discourse became of very great significance. For Leo, the idea of

<sup>7</sup> *Scriptum super libros Sententiarium,* Book III, distinction 35, question 1, article 4, solution lc.

dignity was part of a view of the world that vindicated hierarchy-in Church, society, and family:

> For, He who created and governs all things has, in His wise providence, appointed that the things which are lowest should attain their ends by those which are intennediate, and these again by the highest. Thus, as even in the kingdom of heaven He hath willed that the choirs of angels be distinct and some subject to others, and also in the Church has instituted various orders and a diversity of offices, so that all are not apostles or doctors or pastors, so also has He appointed that there should be various orders in civil society, differing in dignity, rights, and power, whereby the State, like the Church, should be one body, consisting of many members, some nobler than others, but all necessary to each other and solicitous for the common good. 8

Like Kant, the nineteenth-century Catholic view was that human beings have dignity in the sense of an inner transcendental kernel of intrinsic value. But, unlike Kant, this was a characteristic that was not unique to human beings, held in isolation, but came to them from their place in a divinely ordained hierarchy.

As in the case of Kant, however, the question arises: what are the ethical consequences of something being a bearer or embodiment of dignity? And, as in the case of Kant, the answer is that this is something that cannot be pursued as an end to be maximized. The difference is that the answer, for Catholics, must come from the eternal truths of natural law and the teachings of revealed religion that are consonant with it. For Leo XIII (as for his predecessor Pius IX and successor Pius X), it was clear that the central message of Catholic social teaching is the need for a properly ordered and respectful hierarchy in societysomething that quite explicitly counters the democratic tendencies of the French Revolution, with its principles of popular sovereignty and equal rights. It is in this context that we encounter dignity in the Catholic thought of that time.

Yet, for whatever reasons, by the end of the Second World War, the immutable truths of natural law turned out to be far less hostile to doctrines of social equality and rights than they had been thought to be in the previous century. It is in that light that we can appreciate the appearance of dignity in the important human rights documents that appeared in the five years after the end of the conflict. I am thinking in particular of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) and the *Grundgesetz* (Fundamental Law) ofthe Federal Republic of Germany (1949), both of which have dignity in the most prominent position possible and connect it explicitly with rights and (in the case of the Universal Declaration) equality. (The very first sentence of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration reads 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights'; while Article 1 of the *Grundgesetz* states that 'Human

8 *QuodApostolici Muneris* (1878), 6.

dignity is inviolable. To respect it and protect it is the duty of all state power. The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.')

Now, the alert Schopenhauerian might think that the first article of the Universal Declaration confirms the suspicion that talk of dignity is vacuous. What would be lost if one were just to say 'All human beings are born free and equal in rights'? (Indeed, one might suspect that more words could be dropped from that sentence without loss of content.) But the German case is more challenging. Clearly, it requires two things-first, an account of how human dignity is to be protected from violation (if dignity is really an inner transcendental kernel, then what on earth would 'violate' it?) and, second, an explanation of how it is to be connected with 'inviolable and inalienable' human rights? We are returned, are we not, to the Kantian problem.

But perhaps this is not such a great problem. After all, as I have suggested, the end of the Second World War saw an agreement between liberal democratic humanism and the Catholic Church on the basic doctrines of social. equality and rights. If the inclusion of 'dignity' alongside 'rights' in the Universal Declaration adds little content, at least it serves to give expression to that very significant coming-together. Surely, tolerating a little bit of humbug is a small price to pay for something so important.

Yet this would, I fear, be over-optimistic. First of all, the adoption of dignity-whether inspired by Kantianism or Catholicism-still leaves the question: what follows from this as a matter of practical ethical decision-making? And here, it is clear, there is both agreement and disagreement between liberal democratic humanism and Catholicism. While post-war Catholics have (with exceptions, of course-but then what generalizations about political attitudes do not have exceptions?) been prepared to endorse principles of democracy and equal rights, the differences between Catholicism and liberal humanism on questions of bioethics are very, very stark.

Which leads me to another objection to dignity.

#### Dignity is an attack on autonomy

In 2003, Professor Ruth Macklin published a trenchant editorial in the *British Medical Journal* headlined 'Dignity is a useless concept. It means no more than respect for persons or their autonomy. ' 9 According to Macklin, dignity

<sup>9</sup> Ruth Macklin, 'Dignity is a useless concept', *British Medical Journa/237* (20 December 2003), 1419-20.

has no positive role to play: 'appeals to dignity are either vague restatements of other, more precise notions or mere slogans that add nothing to the understanding of the topic'. Macklin's dismissal of dignity has been echoed by a number of other authors, notably the linguist and psychologist Steven Pinker, whose article 'The stupidity of dignity' echoes Macklin's charge. For Pinker, autonomy, understood as 'informed consent', is all that bioethics needs. 10 On this view, dignity is redundant, mere window dressing for a more fundamental idea. But is dignity simply a more elaborate way of saying autonomy?

The question is made more complicated by the presence in the background of Kant. On the one hand, Kant makes a clear and explicit connection between dignity and autonomy: *'Autonomy* is ... the ground of the dignity of human nature' (Ak. 4:436). Yet he just as clearly prohibits a whole range of actions to which human beings may plausibly give informed consent. The explanation, of course, is that what Kant on the one hand and Macklin and Pinker on the other mean by autonomy is quite different.

On the most obvious interpretation, autonomy means that the self is sovereign-it is, in that sense, a law unto itself. And this idea-that to be autonomous means, essentially, to be able to do as one chooses-is at the heart of the modem idea of autonomy. That is, however, far from being Kant's idea. The Kantian 'self-given law' that governs human beings is law only because it is purged of any association with the arbitrary choices of individuals. It is the choice (if choice it is at all) of our higher, inner, noumenal selves. Hence, suicide, the failure to develop our capacities, and sexual activity outside marriage are all violations of our duties to ourselves for Kant:

> Self-regarding duties ... are independent of all advantage, and pertain only to the worth of being human. They rest on the fact that in regard to our person we have no untrammelled freedom, that humanity in our person must be highly esteemed, since, without this, man is an object of contempt, which is an absolute fault, since he is worthless, not only in the eyes of others, but also in himself. The self-regarding duties are the supreme condition and *principium* of all morality, for the worth of the person constitutes moral worth. (Ak. 27:343 *(Moral Philosophy: Collins))*

The modem conception of autonomy that centres on the sovereign choice of the individual does not have to deny the very existence of duties to oneself (though Bernard Williams, famously, dismisses them as 'fraudulent items'), but what it certainly denies is the right of the state to override individuals' choices in the name of such duties.

10 Steven Pinker, 'The stupidity of dignity', *The New Republic* (28 May 2008), 28.

Is this what dignity does? If one looks solely at the USA, this would seem implausible. Consider the celebrated 'Philosophers' Brief' on assisted suicide. 11 The six philosophers (Dworkin, Nagel, Nozick, Rawls, Scanlon, and Thomson) argued that the patient-plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court had what they termed a 'constitutionally protected liberty interest' in hastening their own deaths. Such a 'constitutionally protected liberty interest' could be inferred, they argued, from the Court's own jurisprudence. Significantly, they appealed to the Supreme Court's decision in *Planned Parenthood v. Casey* (505 U.S. 833, 851 (1992)), in which the Court had referred to 'the right of people to make their own decisions about matters involving the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy'. Dignity, then, in the view of the Court at that time, appeared to be synonymous with (or closely parallel to) autonomy, and required individuals to be allowed the power of choice over matters that they consider to be of the highest importance to themselves.

But this autonomy-friendly conception of dignity is not the only one to be found in modem jurisprudence. The clearest example to the contrary is the well-known case of M. Manuel Wackenheim-the French dwarf who was prohibited on grounds of the violation of dignity from participating in a dwarf-tossing contest. I shall not retrace the details ofM. Wackenheim's path from administrative court to *Conseil d'Etat* to the Human Rights Committee of the UN, but note two things. First, that dignity was invoked to override M. Wackenheim's vigorously asserted choice and, second, that-the presence of dignity in a central position in the preamble to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights notwithstanding-M. Wackenheim's own claim that the ban on dwarf-tossing actually violated his dignity was not given weight. It seems, then, that so far from protecting individuals' autonomy, dignity, in this case at least, was being used by the courts to override it on the following schema:

- 1. Dwarf-tossing is undignified Therefore:
- 2. Dwarf-tossing violates the dignity of those who participate in it However:
- 3. Dignity is inviolable So:
- 4. The fact that dwarf-tossing is an activity that has been freely chosen by the participants is no reason to permit it.

<sup>11</sup> *New York Review of Books* (27 March 1997).

And this brings me to the final objection to dignity that I shall consider in this chapter:

# Dignity is used by courts as a licence to illegitimately overrule democratic authority

Democratic countries with courts that practise judicial review of legislation face what is commonly called the 'counter-majoritarian difficulty'-by what right do they override decisions that can claim legitimacy by deriving from the decision of a popularly elected legislature? If that objection is to be metor so the classical argument goes-it is because courts represent the means by which the rights of individuals can be protected against the (potential) 'tyranny of the majority'.

Now if dignity as an inner transcendental kernel of human value is indeed the magic bean out of which has sprung forth all the rich foliage of human rights, as the *Grundgesetz* and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights assert, 12 then it can be used to justifY intervention by courts to override the legislature.

On the other hand, if the claim that there is a path from the inner transcendental kernel to specific rights is unsustainable, then it would appear that courts are operating freelance, and that their decisions-rhetorically framed in the grandiloquent language about dignity as they may be-lack basic moral legitimacy. Of course, this is an enormously difficult charge to evaluate-how could one hope to prove it one way or the other? Yet there are reasons to be suspicious, to say the least. The two leading candidates for a route from dignity to specific rights-Kantianism and Catholic natural law theory-are each (understatement yet again) open to dispute. Moreover, how could it be legitimate for democratic societies, in which the fact of moral pluralism appears to be fundamental, to plump for either one of these controversial comprehensive moral theories and impose it on their citizens?

Looking at the practice of courts that have used dignity to override democratic authority or individual choice does not eliminate those suspicions. The case ofM. Wackenheim is plainly a case where the requirement of being *dignified* is taken to have the force of dignity in the sense of an inner transcendental

<sup>12</sup> The preamble to the ICCPR asserts that 'in accordance with the principles proclaimed in the Charter of the United Nations, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world ... [and] these rights derive from the inherent dignity of the human person'.

kernel-something that may (indeed, must) be defended with the authority of the state, irrespective of the will of the individual concerned. Similarly, the notion of dignity has been invoked by the German Constitutional Court in two decisions on abortion that clearly contradict the will of the legislature, vetoing legislative proposals for the (limited) legalization of abortion in both 1975 and 1993. Of course, abortion is a moral issue on which societies divide. Yet in 2005, over 60 per cent of Germans agreed with the proposition 'If a woman does not want children, she should be able to have an abortion'. That the notion of dignity should have been used in this way by the courts to override the moral judgement of this substantial majority as expressed through their legislative representatives ought to be extremely troubling to democrats.

Nor is it just the places where dignity has been appealed to by courts in support of their decisions that are of concern. Looking at the jurisprudence of the *Verfassungsgericht,* it is noteworthy too that the courts have conspicuously *failed* to intervene in the name of dignity in what might have been thought to be obvious cases of attacks on individuals' basic rights. For instance, in the so-called *AbhOrurteil* of 1970, the Court refused to intervene to control extensive surveillance by the state of citizens' private communications on the grounds that this could not be a violation of dignity, since it did not amount to behaviour that expressed 'contempt for the value that the human being has in virtue of being a person' (BVerfGE, 30, 1). (This narrowing, we might note, plainly contradicts the idea of dignity as the inner transcendental kernel from which human rights in general are derived that is the clear implication of the first paragraph of the German *Grundgesetz.)* 

#### Conclusion

So, would we be better off without dignity?

This is, I think, a misplaced question. Dignity is surprisingly deeply entrenched in our moral discourse: it is not going anywhere any time soon. What it does lack, however, is a single, well-defined core of meaning, and that ambiguity leaves it open to exploitation. In my view, there are four main, distinct, conceptually divisible strands.

- 1. There is the idea of dignity as rank or status-an idea that can be complicated by the idea that dignity is a status that all human beings share (but then, what does that amount to?), or that worldly status is not the same as real status-status seen from the point of view of religious faith
#### 154 *Michael Rosen*

- 2. There is the idea of dignity as an inner transcendental kernel that allegedly founds-generates and justifies-the rich diversity of human rights
- 3. There is the idea of dignity as the quality of action or bearing that goes with being *dignified-a* valuable quality, no doubt, but not something that all human beings have, inalienably, in common and
- 4. There is the idea that human beings should be treated *with* dignity--that it is important that the state does not just act in ways that are consonant with their welfare and allow them to exercise rational control over their own destinies but that it also acts in ways that express respect for them as human beings.

While we could not-and should not attempt to-get rid of dignity from public discourse entirely, democrats should certainly try to hold those who invoke dignity to account by requiring them, at the least, to specify the sense in which they are doing so. Perhaps then they will be in a better position to resist the use of dignity as a cloak behind which interested parties seek to impose moral prescriptions that lack the legitimacy of a popular mandate.
