# **Human Dignity, Human Rights, and Simply Trying to Do the Right Thing**

#### *Roger Brownsword*

#### Introduction

THOSE WHO DEBATE the nature and requirements of human dignity and human rights, as well as the relationship between the two, seem to agree about very little. However, I take it that each and every disputantwould agree that it is important that humans should try to do the right thing. The problem is that, as soon as we each articulate and elaborate the criteria that we believe to be appropriate for determining which actions are right and which wrong, we find that we are no longer in agreement. Still, we should not forget that, at root, we see humans as characteristically having the capacity for moral reflection, for moral judgment, and for action that is guided by moral reasons. In short, we agree that, characteristically, humans have the capacity for doing the right thing; we agree that they should try to do just that; and many will also agree that humans express their dignity precisely by acting on their moral judgments and doing what they judge to be the right thing for the right reason.

In these short reflections !!rising from the conference discussions, I am adopting a public regulatory perspective, and I am assuming a context of rapid technological development, particularly the development of biotechnologies. As the (US) President's Council on Bioethics has put it:

> we have entered upon a golden age for biology, medicine, and biotechnology. With the completion of (the DNA sequencing phase of) the Human Genome Project and the emergence of stem cell research, we can look forward to major insights into human development, normal and abnormal, as well as novel and more precisely selected treatments for human disease. 1

However, this is by no means the full extent of the current development of novel technologies. Alongside biotechnology, there have been important de-

velopments in both nanotechnologies and in neurotechnology. Thus, the council continues:

> Advances in neuroscience hold out the promise of powerful new understandings of mental processes and behavior, as well as remedies for devastating mental illnesses. Ingenious nanotechnological devices, implantable into the human body and brain, raise hopes for overcoming blindness and deafness, and, more generally, of enhancing native human capacities of awareness and action ... In myriad ways, the discoveries of biologists and the inventions of biotechnologists are steadily increasing our power ever more precisely to intervene into the workings of our bodies and minds and to alter them by rational design. 2

When we add enabling developments in information and communication technology into this mix, we should not be surprised that, in the twenty-first century, it is technology that attracts so much of our regulatory attention.

I will start by responding to one of the key questions raised at the conference,3 namely: why at this particular juncture in human history are we debating human dignity with such intensity? Why human dignity and why now? My answer, as I have already hinted, is that the development of new technologies is a critical driver of these debates. This is followed by some reflections on the way in which debates about the challenges to human dignity that are generated by developments in biotechnology put the ideal of regulatory coherence under stress. Even ifthere is coherence on the surface of regulation, we soon find the pressure points once we drill down.4 Finally, I take up another cue from the conference. One way of putting this is to ask what kind of society it would be if human dignity disappeared from our regulatory discourse. What kind of dystopia would this be? In this part of the chapter, I identify two threats to human dignity that are immanent in modem regulatory thinking. One threat is the rise of a risk paradigm that marginalizes (and possibly excludes) moral considerations; and the other is an over-reliance on technological instruments such that the complexion of the regulatory environment denies humans the opportunity to express their dignity.

### Why human dignity, and why now?

Why are we debating human dignity? Why, at this particular time, do we think it is such an urgent issue? If the question is why we, the British, are now turning our minds towards our understanding of human dignity, then we might respond that this is a case of 'better late than never'. A dozen years ago, when the British were debating whether regulators should be authorized to license human embryonic stem cell research, the idea that research of this kind might compromise human dignity-an idea widely expressed elsewhere-had little or no resonance. 5 For the British now to be taking human dignity seriously is simply to catch up with those many others who, for some time, have recognized human dignity as a fundamental value. Indeed, whether we are viewing the regulatory landscape regionally (e.g., looking at the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine) or internationally (e.g., in UNESCO's work and especially in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights), human dignity is a prominent feature. Why is this so?

No doubt there are many stories to be told about the resurgent interest in human dignity.6 However, it seems to me that one of the principal drivers is the latest round of science and technology, particularly bioscience and biotechnologies. Although a commitment to human rights places some conditions on the application of these new technologies, the restrictions usually hinge on obtaining the informed consent of the parties to whom the technologies are applied. For those who want stronger limits, human dignity (specifically, in a conservative, sometimes communitarian, sometimes Catholic, articulation) holds the key.7 On this view, the fact that an agent consents to a procedure (say, human reproductive cloning) is irrelevant: human dignity is non-negotiable.

·Accordingly, one of the principal reasons why we now have such an intense interest in human dignity is because the development of new biotechnologies challenges important values that many take to be central to our essential humanity.8 To put the point sharply, we appeal to human dignity in order to stop science; or, at any rate, we appeal to human dignity to ensure

that the regulatory environment sets clear and firm limits to the reach of science and to the use and exploitation of new technologies. If revolutionary developments in biotechnology, neurotechnology, and the like were not being announced, we would not have such anxieties; and human dignity would be less of a focus for our debates.9 But we do seem to be on the cusp of various technological revolutions; and, like it or not, human dignity becomes central to our regulatory deliberations. 10

# Human dignity, human rights, and regulatory coherence

According to Article 2(d) of the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights 2005, one of the aims of the Declaration is:

> to recognize the importance of freedom of scientific research and the benefits derived from scientific and technological developments, while stressing the need for such research and developments to occur within the framework of ethica} principles set out in this Declaration and to respect human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Article 3.1 simply states that 'Human dignity, human rights and fundamental freedoms are to be fully respected.' Similar provisions, to repeat, are commonplace in regional and international instruments of this kind. What, though, does human dignity require us to respect?

In my introductory remarks, I suggested that reflections on human dignity and human rights are rooted in the idea that it is important that humans should try to do the right thing for the right reason-this is the governing aspiration of any moral community. It follows that all members of such a community (whether as regulators or as regulatees) should-orient their actions to this ideal, trying to put in place a regulatory environment that reflects their best moral judgments. However, to embed human rights and human dignity in regulatory regimes is the beginning and not the end of the story because, as is all too well known, these concepts can be appealed to from radically opposed sections of the political spectrum. Putting the matter somewhat crudely, while liberals appeal to human dignity in order to extend and protect the sphere of individual choice, conservatives appeal to human dignity in order to set limits

to what they see as the legitimate sphere of individual choice, or to emphasize the priority of community over individuality. 11

At Oxford, we did not discuss the UNESCO Declaration. However, in almost every session, the differences between the liberal and the conservative takes on human dignity were played out. Had we debated the Declaration, those rival articulations surely would have been voiced. This is a thoroughly familiar story, but in what follows I want to draw out the way in which these differences can put pressure on the ideal of regulatory coherence. In order to do this, I will comment briefly on two much-debated recent European decisions in each of which human dignity is the key concept. These decisions are *Oliver Briistle v Greenpeace E.* V. 12 at the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and *SH v Austria13* at the European Court of Human Rights.

First, in *Briistle,* the ECJ (following the Opinion given by Advocate General Yves Bot) held that a patent should not be granted for biotechnological innovation where the research employed materials that were derived from human embryos that were necessarily destroyed. Seemingly, this decision was driven by the conservative view (embedded in Article 6 of Directive 98/44/ EC on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions, and specifically in Article 6(2)( c)) that the use of human embryos as research tools compromises human dignity. 14 For those who do not share this view, the head-on objection is that this misunderstands the application of human dignity (or, at one step removed, that moral judgments of this contested kind simply should not be drawn down to exclude what would otherwise be a patentable invention). However, the objection that I am interested in following through is one that maintains that the *Briistle* decision lacks regulatory coherence.

Stated formally, regulatory coherence demands that the provisions of a regulatory regime should not be contradictory. Actually, it would have been very easy for *Briistle* to have set up such a contradiction, because the Enlarged Board-of Appeal (EBA) at the European Patent Office had already decided, on materially similar facts, that a patent was excluded. 15 If *Briistle* had ruled that the patent could stand, Article 6(2)(c) notwithstanding, when the EBA had ruled that the same provision excluded a patent in these circumstances, that

would have resulted in an obvious case of regulatory incoherence. Given that *Brilstle* did not hand down a decision that flatly contradicted some other part of the European patent regime, in what sense can it be charged with a lack of regulatory coherence?

The argument starts with observing that the research into Parkinson's disease undertaken by Oliver Briistle was perfectly lawful in Germany; and we need no reminding that German law takes the protection of human embryos more seriously than almost anywhere else in Europe. Assuming that German law and EC law is all part of one regulatory regime, the question posed by the objectors is this: how can it be coherent to permit Briistle to carry out research that uses materials derived from human embryos and yet to deny a patent on the products of that research for just the reason that human embryonic materials were utilized?

The answer to this question turns on characterizing the denial or exclusion of a patent in the right way. Patent law incentivizes or encourages research that promises to be of public benefit. Like IP law more generally, proprietary rights are granted (or at any rate should be granted) only where this accords with the public interest. 16 It follows that to deny a patent is not to prohibit the underlying research activity; rather, it is to decline to encourage it. So the *Brilstle* decision does not prohibit an activity that is permitted elsewhere in the regulatory regime; it is not contradictory in such a straightforward way. Nevertheless, the objectors will argue that it is incoherent to decline to encourage a research activity that is permitted-indeed, some might contend that, unless the research activity is prohibited, it is incoherent for regulators to do anything other than encourage it. 17 However, that surely is not correct. It seems to me *that,jormally* at least, it is coherent to gloss a permission with a lack of encouragement. Contract law, for example, declines to enforce many everyday transactions (gambling being an obvious example) on the ground that they are contrary to morals, even though those transactions are permitted. In doing so, regulators signal that a transaction is permitted but not encouraged. Moreover, I suspect that liberal-minded parents often signal something rather similar to their teenage children. It follows that the *Brilstle* decision does not fail for a lack of regulatory coherence in a formal sense.

That said, the particular reasons relied on in *Brilstle* might fail to satisfy a standard of substantive regulatory coherence. In other words, even if *Brilstle* survives scrutiny at the formal level, it might fail for want of substantive

regulatory coherence. Developing this line of objection, the argument is that the European jurisprudence of human rights gives no support to the idea that human embryos have rights; and from this we can take it that the same jurisprudence gives no support for declining to encourage research that makes use of human embryos. Hence, *Briistle* involves a more subtle kind of regulatory incoherence. What should we make of this?

Defenders of *Briistle* will have to concede that in the key cases at Strasbourg the Court has held that human embryos (and foetuses) do not have rights under the Convention. 18 However, the inference that the European jurisprudence of human rights gives no support for discouraging research that makes use of human embryos is much more questionable. For example, defenders might point to Article 18 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine as a clear signal that the use of human embryos as research tools is to be discouraged. 19 Be that as it may, the more important point is that the Strasbourg jurisprudence does no more than deny that human embryos hold rights *directly* under the Convention. This leaves open the possibility that contracting states may grant indirect protection to human embryos, just as in many places protection is afforded to non-human animals. Provided that these indirect protections (motivated by the desire to do the right thing) are not incompatible with the rights directly recognized by the Convention, no regulatory incoherence arises.

This leaves one other dimension of incoherence. Suppose that two rather different accounts are offered in defence of the decision in *Briistle.* One account is quite complex. In the spirit of human rights, it is said, some rights-committed communities might legitimately accord a degree of protection to human embryos (even though they are not direct bearers ofhuman rights); and, respecting this kind of concern for human embryos, the ECJ declined to encourage the use ofhuman embryos as research tools. The other account is much more direct: quite simply, where human embryos are used as research tools, human dignity is compromised and such research activities are not to be encouraged.20 If the better interpretation of the European jurisprudence is that it is predicated on a liberal articulation of human dignity, then the former account has the better

<sup>19</sup> Article 18 (1) provides that 'Where the law allows research on [human] embryos in vitro, it shall ensure adequate protection of the embryo'; and Article 18(2) prohibits the 'creation ofhuman embryos for research purposes'.

<sup>20</sup> Similarly, two accounts might be given of the decision of the ECJ First Chamber in Case C-36/02, *Omega Spielhallen- und Automatenaufttellungs-GmbH v Oberburgermeisterin der Bundesstadt Bonn,*  2004 ECR 1-9609 (14 October 2004).

credentials; for, on this reading, the latter account would involve a deeper kind of regulatory incoherence.21

Turning to the second case, *SH v Austria,* the legal issue was whether Austrian law prohibiting the use of third-party donation of gametes for the purposes of assisted conception is compatible with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). It being agreed that Article 8( 1) was engaged, the question was whether Austria could justify its impingement on privacy by reference to the considerations in Article 8(2).22 By a clear majority, the lower Chamber ruled against Austria but, with some hesitation, the majority of the Grand Chamber held that Austria could justify its local law as falling within the margin of appreciation. Critics of the Grand Chamber's decision are likely to say that it over-extends the margin of appreciation, However, there are two ways in which we might launch such a criticism. One way is to say that, while the margin of appreciation quite rightly recognizes that there are some matters (such as the balance between competing rights) on which communities of rights might reasonably disagree, there are limits to reasonable disagreement on such matters-and, in the instant case, Austria unreasonably insisted on its restrictive position. The other way-and this is the way that is of present interest-is to say that there are some matters that are simply not arguable at all in relation to the margin of appreciation. In other words, some considerations are categorically excluded and simply should not figure where a contracting state pleads the margin of appreciation. Here, the objection to the Grand Chamber's view is that it allows Austria to rely on arguments that simply should be excluded.

How does this latter line of objection run? The key point is that Article 8(2) only supports a state's impingement on privacy where its regulatory objectives are legitimate relative to the purposes specified in Article 8(2). In the Austrian case, the restrictive approach was supported by reference to the protection of local 'morals'. Stated bluntly, Austria feared that if couples could make use of third-party sperm and egg donors (or suppliers), this would allow for couples to seek out 'desirable' donors who would contribute to the birth of children with desired profiles. On the conservative wing, such

<sup>21</sup> In support of such: a liberal rights-driven interpretation, I would rely on arguments derived from Alan Gewirth, *Reason and Morality* (Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1978).

<sup>22</sup> Article 8(2) provides: 'There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.'

commodification of children is one of the clearest cases of compromising human dignity.23 However, if Austria could plead such conservative dignitarian values within the margin of appreciation, this would mean that an illiberal conception of human dignity was being set up against the liberal conception on which some suppose the ECHR to be founded. Possibly Austria could find another justifying reason that would be more in line with the spirit of human rights; but in the absence of such an account it would seem that the case is open to the objection that it lacks substantive regulatory coherence.

On the face of it, both *Briistle* and *SH v Austria* represent triumphs for a conservative articulation ofhuman dignity. We cannot complain that judges in these cases are trying to do the right thing. However, where the jurisprudence has embedded a rather different articulation of human dignity, at first blush, the decisions seem to lack regulatory coherence. If there is a human rightscompatible justification for these decisions, as there might well be in *Briistle,*  then the jurisprudence is not fractured. However, if regulators license both articulations of human dignity, liberal and conservative alike, there is a serious regulatory problem.

These remarks invite further questions about the prospects for regulatory coherence in communities that are deeply morally divided.24 The Directive at issue in the *Briistle* case is a textbook example of a political accommodation between rival articulations of human dignity. While Article 6 registers the acute concerns of conservative dignitarianism, the Directive is otherwise geared to the liberal view that innovative research around the human genome should be treated as 'invention' rather than mere 'discovery' and, in principle, should be treated as patentable. Even the assumption that the ECHR is founded on a liberal understanding of human dignity might be challenged. To the contrary, the modern commitment to human rights might be seen as the agreed outcome of a range of quite different moral views.25 When moral pluralism drives deep into the regulatory environment, even if regulatory instruments avoid obvious prescriptive contradiction, it seems that we must accept that they will have difficulty in keeping faith with the ideal of regulatory coherence all the way down.

What if we lost human dignity from our regulatory discourse?

Some of the interventions at the conference prompted the question: what if our regulatory discourse did not get to, or was not sufficiently sensitized to, the importance of human dignity? Here, I take it that the question is what our regulatory discourse would look like if it did not get to root moral questions. Although such amoralism writ large might seem an improbable scenario, there are two tendencies in modern regulatory thinking that push in this direction. One tendency is the focus on risk; and the other is the focus on effective interventions facilitated by the use of technological regulatory tools.

#### **The risk paradigm**

In its recent report on emerging biotechnologies, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics remarks that 'the most common concern about novel technologies is the difficulty of predicting the likelihood of unintended and undesirable consequences' .26 Indeed, this is so, for one of the first questions is whether the technology is dangerous. Is there a risk to human health and safety or to the environment? If there is such a risk, the challenge then is to manage the risk through various precautionary measures to the point that we can say that the risk is now 'acceptable'. Immediately, two questions arise: acceptable to whom? and acceptable in what sense?

Where the risks and benefits of a new technology concern just one agent, A, and where A, having calculated both the risks and the benefits, then decides whether it is prudent to use the technology, this is a relatively easy case for regulators. However, if the pattern is different-if the risks fall on A and the benefits accrue to B, or if it is C who makes the decision-there are likely to be public regulatory decisions to be made.27 Before these decisions are made, best practice demands that the issues should be debated in a way that fully engages the public. So, for example, when Professor Amy Gutmann was appointed to chair the (US) Presidential Commission for the Study ofBioethical Issues (and first tasked to report on the implications of synthetic biology), she declared that it was her intention to champion informed debate in the spirit of deliberative democracy.28 And, in due course, when the Commission advised that the regulation of synthetic biology should be guided by a strategy

of prudent vigilance, it did so on the basis that decisions would be guided by deliberative democratic debate.29

Even if debates about acceptable risk are broad enough to encompass questions about the equity of distributing risks and benefits in a particular way,30 moralists might object that the community has yet to address the fundamental questions. To be sure, in a moral community it matters that technologies are safe; and it matters that risks and benefits are fairly distributed. Nevertheless, the sense of 'acceptability' that really matters is a moral one. As Henk ten Have has rightly remarked, regulators need to engage with the view 'that unbridled scientific progress is not always ethically acceptable';31 and, for some, the real issue with synthetic biology and other modem biotechnologies is not that they might be dangerous but that they might compromise human dignity.

The cautionary lesson to take from this is that an initial (and possibly exclusive) focus on risk tends to marginalize or even exclude moral considerations. Just because the risk is regulated so that it is 'acceptable' (particularly bearing in mind the negative impact on innovation), it does not follow that we are doing the right thing in developing and applying the technology. It follows that it is critical that regulators take care that, by framing the issues in terms of a calculation of risks and benefits, they do not ignore or downgrade those concerns that lie beyond the risk paradigm (as conventionally conceived).32

#### **The complexion of the regulatory environment**

For communities that have moral aspirations, for communities that take human dignity seriously, it is important that the regulatory environment recognizes the right values and puts moral requirements, permissions, and prohibitions in the right place. So much is trite. Much less obviously, though, it is also important that the 'complexion' ofthe regulatory environment is right, in the sense that it allows for humans to express their dignity by freely choosing to do the right thing for the right reason. One of the reasons why we might be nervous about the impact of the surge of new technologies is not so much that

their application might compromise human dignity in the ways that we have already mentioned but that, as regJilatory tools, they might reduce the scope for the expression of human dignity.

It is in the nature of a regulatory environment that there will be various signals that are intended to direct the conduct of regulatees; there will be various means of monitoring conduct to see whether the directions are being followed; and, where deviation is detected, there will be measures for correction. In such environments, regulators signal whether particular acts are permitted (even required) or prohibited,whether they will be viewed positively, negatively, or neutrally, whether they are incentivized or disincentivized, whether they are likely to be praised or criticized, even whether they are possible or impossible, and so on. 33

One of the key points about the regulatory environment is that we may find regulators employing a range of mechanisms or modalities that are to channel the conduct of their regulatees. Some of these modalities may well be of a legal nature (whether in the form of hard or soft law). It is not that regulatory environments never feature legal signals; and, in many instances, it will be the legal signals that have the highest profile. Nevertheless, the regulatory repertoire goes well beyond legal signals-including, for example, social norms, the market, and architecture (or code). 34 The traditional signals, the signals oflaw and morality, are normative; but, with new technological instruments, some of the regulatory signals might be non-normative. For example, if a car is equipped with sensors that can detect alcohol in the driver, it might be designed to respond normatively (by advising either that it is not safe for the driver to proceed or that, morally, as a matter of respect for ,others, the driver ought not to proceed) or non-normatively (by simply .immobilizing the car).35 Implicit in these remarks we can detect the following three regulatory registers:

- 1. the moral register: here regulators signal that some act, x, categorically ought or ought not to be done relative to standards of right action (as in retributive articulations of the criminal law where the emphasis is on the moral nature of the offence); or
<sup>33</sup> Roger Brownsword and Han Somsen, 'Law, innovation and technology: before we fast forward-a forum for debate', *Law Innovation and Technology* 1 (2009), 1; and Roger Brownsword and Morag Goodwin, *Law and the Technologies of the Twenty-First Century* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2012).

<sup>34</sup> Seminally, see Lawrence Lessig, *Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace* (New York, Basic Books, 1999).

<sup>35</sup> Compare Mireille Hildebrandt, 'Legal and technological normativity: more (and less) than twin sisters', *TECHNE* 12.3 (2008), 169.

- 2. the prudential register: here regulators signal that some act, x, ought or ought not to be done relative to the prudential interests of regulatees (as in deterrence-driven articulations of the criminal law, where the emphasis is on the sanction that will be visited on offenders); or
- 3. the register of practicability or possibility: here regulators signal that it is not reasonably practicable to do some act, x, or even that x simply cannot be done-in which case, regulatees reason, not that x ought not to be done but that x cannot be done (either realistically or literally).

For moralists, regulators who are eager to improve on the effectiveness of their interventions by grasping new technological opportunities need to be watched carefully. In particular, we need to keep an eye on any changes in the registers that regulators employ because these changes can affect the complexion of the regulatory environment in none-too-obvious but critical ways.

First, where there is an increasing reliance on regulatory technologies (for example, CCTV, DNA profiling, RFID tracking and monitoring devices, and so on), there is a real likelihood that the strength and significance of the moral signal will fade. 36 Quite simply, with these technological instruments, the dominant signal to regulatees becomes a prudential one, accentuating that the doing of a particular act is contrary to the interests of regulatees (because, in the event of non-compliance, they will be detected and punished). And with this, as Beatrice von Silva-Tarouca Larsen perceptively observes, 'one should not rule out the possibility that an over-reliance on CCTV, with its emphasis on the instrumental appeal to desist from crime in order to avoid paying the cost, might entail a dilution of the moral reasons for desistence' .37 Although such a dilution of moral reason is a cause for concern, so long as these technologies operate only in support of (rather than in place of) the criminal law, the more serious threat to moral community has yet to manifest itself.

latter threat arises when regulatory technologies are employed to manage environments in ways that limit the options that are realistically available to regulatees. In such settings, the signal is no longer normative; rather it becomes that an act is either not practicable (such as trying to board an aircraft for an international flight without going through the security scans, or riding the metro without buying a ticket) or simply not possible.38 In such strongly managed environments, the space for self-interested (prudential) reason is

squeezed, and more importantly it is the opportunities for acting on moral reason that are restricted. In such non-normative managed environments, how are aspirant moral humans to express the *dignity* of their actions? Where the regulatory environment is managed so that 'wrongdoing' is designed out, so that the only possible acts are those that conform to the approved regulatory pattern, how can human agents express the most basic of moral virtues by showing that they are doing the right thing for the right reason?

Arguably, there is a deep paradox in the idea that, in a community with moral aspirations, the regulatory environment must leave open the option of humans doing the wrong thing so that they can express their dignity by choosing to do the right thing. It might also seem absurd that regulators should eschew strategies that are effective in reducing risk to human health and safety by designing-in appropriate technological features; and it might seem implausible that regulating technologies will be used to the point that human dignity is crowded out in this way.39 It is also arguable that, in the final analysis, provided that humans do the right thing it really does not matter whether they do it for the right reason.40 Each of these points merits debate. However, unless we have the complexion of the regulatory environment on our rada:r, we might find that the conditions for simply doing the right thing for the right reason have changed without our noticing that this was happening.

# Conclusion

At a time when technologies are growing like compound interest, we need to ask whether moral community is threatened by regulators who operate with a risk-management mentality. We also need to ask whether, in increasingly complex technological environments, there is a danger that we lose sight of the simple virtue of doing the right thing. If oUr current preoccupation with human dignity leads us to ponder such questions, then *(pace* the sceptics) we need to keep it in the regulatory foreground.
