# **Human Dignity: Experience and History, Practical Reason and Faith**

#### *David Hollenbach*

HUMAN DIGNITY HAS MOVED to the forefront of recent discourse about the normative standards that should govern human affairs. Since the promulgation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, the duty to respect the dignity of all human beings has come to be seen as the most fundamental duty that men and women owe each other in their interpersonal and social interactions. The concept of human dignity as a standard of morality is surely not an invention of recent decades. Some argue that it has deep roots in Greek philosophy and biblical religion. Others trace it back to medieval theories of natural law, to the French and American revolutions with their roots in Enlightenment reason, or to the anti-slavery movements of the nineteenth century. Nearer to today, the Nazi Holocaust of the Jewish people 'shocked the conscience' of humankind and has become a standard point of reference in reflection on the role that respect for human dignity ought to play in human affairs, as have the revulsion at the consequences of the two world wars, which made the twentieth century the bloodiest in European history. Post-war rejection of colonial domination and the struggle against Soviet tyranny further strengthened the emerging conviction that respect for the dignity of persons was a central social value.

Each of these explanations of why human dignity has become so central to normative approaches to social life has implications for what dignity means and how we interpret its requirements. This chapter will certainly not attempt to give a full treatment of human dignity's contemporary importance, meaning, and practical implications. Rather, by appealing to historical experience of the violation and attainment of dignity, some partial suggestions will be offered about how we might come to a better understanding of what it means and what it requires.

# Objections to dignity

Despite the centrality of human dignity and human rights in contemporary social debate, some scholars have raised questions about whether the idea of human dignity is useful, and whether it will bear the weight placed on it in today's normative and ethical discourse.' For example, Ruth Macklin, a philosopher specializing in bioethics, has written an essay entitled 'Dignity Is a Useless Concept'.2 She argues that dignity is too vague a standard to be useful in making judgements about difficult ethical matters. If dignity is to function effectively as a norm, we need to be able to determine with some precision when it is being violated. Macklin believes, however, that this is impossible because of the abstractness of the idea of dignity. Thus, she holds that respect for the liberal principle of autonomy is much more helpful than appeals to dignity, especially in domains as complex as contemporary biomedical ethics. In Macklin's view, therefore, appeals to an abstract concept of human dignity can be dispensed with in the field ofbioethics without any notable loss.

Others have argued that appeals to human dignity should be avoided in secular or pluralistic societies because they depend on metaphysical or religious convictions that are not broadly shared in such societies. For example, irritation at the references to religious grounds for dignity in a volume of essays on *Human Dignity and Bioethics* produced by the US President's Council on Bioethics led evolutionary psychologist Stephen Pinker to write a dismissive essay entitled 'The Stupidity of Dignity'. Pinker sees the appeals to dignity in the Council's volume as an effort to 'impose a radical political agenda, fed by fervent religious impulses, onto American biomedicine'.3 Indeed, he sees some of the understandings of dignity in this volume as a sign that the President's Council has been co-opted by a group seeking to impose a 'Catholic agenda' on US pluralism.4

In a similar way, Michael Ignatieff maintains that arguments in support of human rights should avoid appealing to dignity because such appeals overlap with contestable religious Claims about the sacredness of human persons. In secular or pluralistic contexts, appeals to metaphysical or even religious convictions about human sacredness as the basis of human rights are not helpful.

<sup>3</sup> Stephen Pinker, 'The stupidity of dignity', *New Republic* (28 May 2008), 28. Michael Rosen notes this danger in a much less polemical way in Chapter 7, this volume.

Through the title ofhis book *Human Rights as Politics and Idolatry,* Ignatieff suggests that calling on a religious or quasi-religious interpretation of dignity to support human rights verges on being a form of idolatry. Some people may be quite ready to affirm dignity as another way of speaking about the sacredness of the person that they affirm on religious grounds; but those who do not believe in God will reject this, and see it as raising the human to a level it does not deserve, thus being a kind of idolatry. To be sure, Ignatieff wants to support human rights. But he believes we should forgo efforts to ground them on claims about a dignity or nature allegedly shared by all human beings. Support for human rights will be more secure if we avoid metaphysical or religious claims about their foundations and rely simply on historical, prudential, or pragmatic evidence that support for rights is desirable. 5 So human rights will be better served if we forgo appeals about their grounding. Again, we can dispense with the idea of dignity.

Still others object to dignity because they see claims to have identified a basis for human rights,that is shared among all human beings as falsely universalizing what are in fact Western cultural and/or religious standards. Dignity could thus be used to try to justify the imposition of particular religious or cultural beliefs on those who do not share these beliefs. This argument has been raised in an Asian, Confucian perspective in a particularly pointed way by Lee K wan Yew and from an African standpoint by Mahmood Mamdani. 6 In their views, seeking to advance human well-being by proposing a universalist understanding of human dignity and human rights carries overtones of colonial or imperial domination. People in diverse cultures are different enough from each other that it is dangerous to claim that one has identified a set of universal norms, such as human rights, that should govern how all people should be treated. Similarly, asserting a common human dignity supposedly shared by all people across cultural boundaries risks granting the interpretation of-dignity in one cultural context a dominant and even repressive role in relation to other cultures.

The idea of human dignity, therefore, faces considerable challenges today. Some of the authors cited use harshly negative terms to characterize the role played by human dignity in contemporary discourse. Dignity is variously described as useless, stupid, idolatrous, and imperialistic. This is certainly not

a promising situation. So should we abandon the effort to understand human dignity before spending any more time on such a debatable undertaking?

# The context of dignity's recent emergence as a key social norm

By no means. I will argue that the concept of human dignity is not abstract and useless, insensitive to religious pluralism, or a potential threat to cultural difference. Such an argument can begin by giving some attention to the context of the emergence of the contemporary stress on human dignity and human rights.

First, we should note that the Preamble of the Universal Declaration states that it is affirming human dignity and human rights because of some utterly concrete evidence for why the idea is needed. The Declaration's starting point is what happens to human beings when dignity is *not* respected. Disregard for dignity, the Preamble states, has 'resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind'. 7 The reference is to the slaughter of six million Jews in the Holocaust, an abomination that the drafters hold to be utterly offensive to all but the socially obtuse. The importance of this context is reinforced by the fact that the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was adopted by the UN General Assembly just one day before the Assembly proclaimed human dignity as the basis of human rights in the Universal Declaration.8 The contrast between respect for dignity and descent into barbarisms like genocide indicates one of the most important functions of appeals to human dignity in recent discourse. Respecting human dignity means avoiding those violations of the human person that are so grave that all (or nearly all) persons see them as outrageous

7 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Preamble, http://www.un.org/en!documents/udhr.

8 Samuel Moyn has argued that the Holocaust was at best tangential and perhaps even irrelevant to the drafting of the Universal Declaration. See Moyn, *The Last Utopia:. Human Rights in History* (Cambridge, MA, Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 201 0), chapter 2. Moyn has quite effectively shown that the close linkage of human rights discourse and the Holocaust became much more explicit several decades after the Declaration was drafted rather than at the time of the drafting. However, the appeal to deeds that 'outraged the conscience of mankind' and the proclamation of the Universal Declaration just one day after the Genocide Convention suggests that the two are not as unrelated as Moyn maintains. Indeed, later appeals to the Universal Declaration to resist genocide would not be possible without the link between the two that is at least incipient in human rights discourse from the time of the drafting of the Universal Declaration. As will be clear from what follows, I diverge from Moyn in holding that changes in emphasis and even in the understanding of the content of human dignity do not necessarily imply radical discontinuity. 'Development of doctrine', as the term is used is Catholic theology, sees historical change, even dramatic change, as at least sometimes compatible with continuity in tradition. Moyn, on the other hand, sees change as most often suggesting discontinuity.

and shocking. The affirmation of human dignity as the basis of rights begins from objection to such outrages, and is proposed as an alternative to them. It points to the utterly concrete experience of those who suffered and died in the camps, who lost spouses, children, and parents to campaigns based on racist ideology, and who were forced to flee their homes as refugees and asylum seekers because of the efforts of an authoritarian demagogue to shape the world according to his deluded image of what it should look like. The affirmation of dignity in this context is far from an abstract norm that provides only ambiguous guidance. Rather, it is a normative declaration that such outrages should never happen. Indeed, dignity is proposed as a way of understanding our relation to each other that explains why we see such actions as outrageous.

The Preamble of the Universal Declaration invokes not only the Holocaust as the antithesis of its affirmation of dignity, but also the human destruction of two twentieth-century world wars. As an alternative to such destruction, the Declaration affirms that 'recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world'. In addition, the Preamble notes the waves of anti-colonial sentiment that arose in India in the 1940s and spread across other parts of Asia and across Africa in the 1950s and 1960s. Respect for dignity, the Preamble maintains, is required if people are 'not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression'. If respect for dignity and rights is lacking, oppression, grave injustice, and the violence of war can be expected to follow. 9 Respect for human dignity is seen as the antithesis of the evils that flow from oppression and violence.

This, kind of appeal to human dignity can be called the 'Kantian moment' in discourse about human dignity. For Kant, the' fundamental standard of morality is that all human beings be treated with respect, as ends in themselvesrather than only as means to be used for some other purpose. The value of a human being-the person's dignity-is beyond price. Things with price can be exchanged for each other in the marketplace, but humans, having dignity, are valuable in themselves and thus cannot be simply traded one for another. 10 The response due to human dignity is respect for the inherent worth

<sup>9</sup> Moyn also rejects this linkage of the Universal Declaration to subsequent anti-colonial movements. See *The Last Utopia,* chapter 3. My divergence from Moyn again rests on noting that subsequent appeals to the Universal Declaration by anti-colonialists would not be possible without this incipient anti-colonial affirmation in the Declaration itself.

<sup>10</sup> Immanuel Kant, *Grounding for the Metaphysics of Morals,* trans. James W. Ellington, 3rd edn (Indianapolis, IN, Hackett, 1993), 40-1 [434--5].

of the person, not the kind of fairness that is involved in setting a just price for a commodity being exchanged in the marketplace.

One aspect of Kant's understanding of dignity, therefore, is that it affirms *who counts* when we are distributing the benefits of our life together in political, social, and interpersonal interaction. It concerns the scope of the community that the standards of morality should govern. Who are included in the 'we' that are to be governed by the standards of morality being proposed? The idea of dignity insists that the most fundamental moral 'we' includes *all*  human persons. *All* deserve to be treated in a way that takes account of their common humanity.

Dignity is used in a similar way by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration affirms the reality of a global community to which *all* human beings belong.U This is evident in the way the terms 'all', 'everyone', and 'no one' are used throughout the Declaration to indicate the subjects of the enumerated human rights. All persons possess human rights without distinctions based on 'race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin' .12 The idea that *all* persons share human dignity, therefore, relativizes all in-group/out-group boundaries. It challenges understandings of religious, national, or cultural identities that suggest only those people who possess that identity have the kind of worth that is deserving of respect.

The use of the idea of human dignity in contemporary human rights discourse thus follows Kant's lead not only in affirming the existence of universal moral obligations but also in closely linking these obligations with the requirement of respect for humanity as such. In response to the realities of the Holocaust, the violence of world wars, potential harms that can be caused by anti-colonial struggles, and the oppression of would-be revolutionary states such as those that formed the Soviet bloc, contemporary appeals to human dignity affirm both the universal reach of moral obligation beyond all ingroup/out-group divides and the duty to treat every human being with the respect due to their irreplaceable worth.

12 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 2.

<sup>11</sup> Though Moyn is right that anti-colonial movements of the 1950s and 1960s sought national selfdetermination by states, the Universal Declaration affirms human rights,in a way that goes beyond such a state-centred understanding of self-determination. Jacques Miuitain, who contributed to the philosophical underpinnings of the Universal Declaration, makes a forceful argument that rights must reach beyond state sovereignty. See his *Man and the State* (Cjlicago, University of Chicago Press, 1951), chapter 2 and 194-201.

# An inductive understanding of dignity

It is true, of course, that Kant's moral philosophy is not without problems. But I believe there are alternative routes to the affirmation that all persons are due the respect that Kant calls for that do not depend on the whole of his systematic moral philosophy. Let me suggest the very general outlines of one such approach. The approach to understanding human dignity I would propose avoids Kant's effort to deduce an understanding of dignity from the preconditions of rational thought. Rather, it follows a more inductive approach that begins in human experience. Because of this, it can be called a more Aristotelian approach to an understanding of human dignity. Aristotle sought to identify the concrete dimensions of the good life in an inductive way by considering evidence from all the societies known to him. 13 In like manner, we can seek to determine what sort of respect is due to human beings, and thus what their dignity requires, by paying attention to the diverse religious, cultural, and political communities of our world, and observing how they believe persons should be treated. This will surely show considerable pluralism regarding how people think they should be treated and how they should treat others. In the midst of this pluralism, however, through practical reflection on the agreements, disagreements, and relative strengths of these diverse conceptions of dignity, some common standards may emerge. Such an inductive, experiencebased approach may lead to transcultural agreement on at least some of the most basic requirements of respect for human worth. In fact, this is just what happened when people from many diverse traditions reached consensus on the most basic requirements of dignity when they drafted the Universal Declaration in 1948.

Using a phrase borrowed from Margaret Farley, one can call the requirements of respect for dignity 'obligating features of personhood' .14 One might also call them obligating features of human dignity. These are dimensions of personal dignity that indicate not only *that* we should show respect towards one another but *what* it will mean to show such respect. Farley identifies two such features: autonomy (the capacity to be self-determining and not have one's life simply shaped by other persons or external powers), and relationality (the fact that persons cannot survive, thrive, or even exist as persons without some fundamental relatedness to other persons ). 15 Because autonomy

<sup>13</sup> See especially Aristotle, *Nicomachean Ethics,* book X, chapters 4-6.

<sup>14</sup> This phrase, and some of the analysis that follows, is drawn from Margaret A. Farley, 'A feminist version of respect for persons', *Journal of Feminist Studies* in *Religion* 9:1-2 (Spring-Fall, 1993), 183-98.

<sup>15</sup> MargaretA. Farley, 'A feminist version of respect for persons', 187, 189.

can be interpreted in an excessively individualistic way, I would prefer to call the first of these features of personhood 'freedom' rather than 'autonomy'. In addition, I want to add 'basic needs' such as the need for food or health care as a third obligating feature of personhood that will·help specify the meaning of human dignity and what respect for dignity requires.

The importance of these freedoms, relationships, and needs as crucial features of personhood emerges from reflection on the experience of what it is to be human. Long ago, Aristotle drew from experience the conclusion that human beings are different from both beasts and from gods, and should be treated differently from both beasts and gods. 16 This conclusion surely remains intelligible and valid today, even in the midst of our experience of cultural diversity. It points to some key ways in which our human personhood generates both negative and positive obligations in our interaction with each other. Not being a beast is having a capacity for self-transcendence that is unique to beings with consciousness or spirit. It is a key index of the distinctive worth of human personhood, and it points to a central aspect of how humans can reasonably expect to be treated by each other. We should support one another in undertaking activities ofthe spirit, such as growing in knowledge and exercising freedom. In addition, this capacity of human consciousness to move beyond itself is evident in the formation and sustaining of personal relationships in friendship and love. Respecting humanity requires, as a minimum, that we refrain from denying each other the most basic freedoms and relationships of these kinds, unless we have solid justification for doing so.

To respect a person's ability to know, make choices, and form bonds of relationship and love is to respect the claim of what she is and to acknowledge what she can become. Similarly, a second person is capable of experiencing that claim precisely because the second person also possesses the capacity for self-transcendence. This other person is not confined within the limits of his self-consciousness but can genuinely encounter the other as a fellow human being. Thus, one human being *is* a kind of *ought* in the face of another. Each person's capacity for self-transcendence makes a claim on the other's capacity for self-transcendence. One person's ability to know and understand calls out for acknowledgement in the understanding shown by others. One person's freedom places requirements on the freedom of another. One person's capacity

<sup>16</sup> That human beings are neither beasts nor gods and should be treated accordingly is a presupposition of ethical politics. See Aristotle, *Politics,* Book I, chapter 3 (1253•). Martha Nussbaum takes this as a fundamental presupposition of her 'capabilities approach' to ethics in social and economic life. See, for example, Nussbaum, 'Human capabilities, female human beings', in Martha Nussbaum and Jonathan Glover (eds), *Women, Culture, and Development: A Study of Human Capabilities* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1995), 61-104, at 73.

to form bonds of relationship with others calls for acknowledgment and support through the concern of others. 17 These affirmations lead to a vision of the human race as a genuine moral community with reciprocal obligations among all its members. This is a cosmopolitan vision of a universal human community. Along with its respect for cultural differences, it also holds that basic common standards of dignity can be identified across cultures.

Aristotle also held that human beings are not gods, that the human good is that of a bodily being and has material conditions. Human dignity can only be realized if these material conditions are present, and it cannot be realized if they are lacking. Dignity requires not only that one's freedom and relatedness be secured and protected; it also requires food, shelter, bodily integrity, medical care in sickness, and a number of other material supports. Therefore, it can be reasonably affirmed that we have some responsibilities to enable one another to share in the material goods and physical, bodily activities that are among the conditions required for living with dignity. Again, at the minimum we have a duty not to deprive one another of these material basics.

Respect for all three of these features of personhood-freedoms, relationships, and basic needs-were evidently seen as required by human dignity by the drafters of the Universal Declaration. They saw dignity not as an abstract standard but as a way of referring to those inductively identified characteristics of personhood that make concrete demands for respect on other persons and on social institutions. Some, perhaps many, of these characteristics were identified through their absence. Thus, the experience of the effects of denial of freedoms because of religion, ethnicity, or race led to the affirmation that respect for freedom and dignity is due to all persons independent of their religious, ethnic, or racial identity. Further reflection on experience led a more inclusive list of the features of personhood that must be respected if persons are to be treated as such. These include the freedoms that enable orre to be a self-determining person of one's own: freedom from slavery or arbitrary arrest, freedom of movement, thought, conscience, religion, expression, and assembly. They include patterns of relationship that enable people to participate actively in the interpersonal and social interactions that are necessary for the well-being both of individual persons and ofthe communities of which they are members. Finally, they imply that respect for persons and their

<sup>17</sup> See William Luijpen, *Phenomenology of Natural Law* (Pittsburgh, PA, Duquesne University Press, 1967), chapter 6, 'Justice as an anthropological form of co-existence', especially 180. For approaches that are both similar and interestingly different from this, see Lyotard, 'The other's rights', in Stephen Shute and Susan Hurley (eds), *On Human Rights: The Oxford Amnesty Lectures 1993* (New York, Basic Books, 1993), 135-47, and Jacques Derrida, *Of Hospitality* (Stanford, CA, Stanford University Press, 2000).

dignity requires securing basic levels of subsistence, meeting other bodily needs such as the requirements of basic health, and the protection of persons through respect for their bodily integrity.

These forms of freedom, relationship, and need-fulfilment are seen to be essential to human well-being through reflection on experience, especially on the experience of their absence. Indeed, reflection on experience leads to the conclusion that some truly basic freedoms, relations, and needs are required if persons are to live lives that can be judged to meet the minimum requirements of humanity. In other words, the most basic freedoms, relationships, and needs are essential to the attainment of human dignity. They specify in a concrete way what is required if human dignity is to be respected. They are obligating features of human dignity. Their fuller development leads to the articulation of human rights that specify the minimum standards for the protection of human dignity.

# Demands of dignity through practical reason

This specification of the dimensions of human dignity in the Universal Declaration's catalogue of human rights was an example of practical reason in action. Jacques Maritain, who participated in the drafting of the Declaration, saw the process as a vivid illustration of how practical reason can lead people from diverse religious and cultural traditions to agreement on moral values even when their understandings of ultimate meanings are different. Maritain observed that the drafters could 'agree about the rights but on condition that no one asks us why' .18 Representatives of diverse religious and cultural traditions might be unable to reach agreement on the requirements of human dignity if they sought to deduce them from ultimate beliefs about the world and God. But this did not prevent the attainment of practical agreement on dignity and rights. Through practical reason, it was possible to reach common practical ideas that led to 'the affirmation of a single body of beliefs *for guidance in action'* .19 That the reasoning involved was practical rather than theoretical did not mean that the agreement reached was simply fortuitous, accidental, or even irrational. The agreement on dignity and rights was in fact a vivid example of human reason in action-practical reason reflecting on human experience. Thus, the understanding of human dignity attained by the drafters of the Universal Declaration was not simply an expression of their preferences,

<sup>19</sup> Maritain, 'Introduction', in *Human Rights: Comments and Interpretations,* 10, emphasis added.

biases, or cultural dispositions. In light ofthe shared experience and reflection that led to it, this understanding of dignity can be called reasonable.

In other words, there can be *good reasons* for conclusions about practical affairs, even when their ultimate significance is interpreted differently in diverse religious and cultural traditions. We can give *reasons* for affirming that human beings should not be slaughtered because they are Jews or Armenians or Rwandan Tutsi, that they should be allowed to express their religious beliefs and intellectual convictions in freedom, that they should not be excluded from participation in political community or denied access to work, that their need for food or health care should be met when their community has the capacity to do so. The reasons we provide will take the form of a statement like this: our experience has led us to the practical conclusion that treating a person as a human being requires this. We have learned from experience, and it is reasonable for us to affirm that these freedoms, relationships, and needs are obligating features of human dignity. Thus, if we are to treat people as they deserve, we must respect this dignity in its multiple dimensions. We have a duty to respect the human rights that spell out these features of dignity in more detail when we have the capacity to do so.

# The interaction of practical and theological interpretations of dignity

Thus, practical reason can lead to shared understanding of the dimensions of human dignity and rights across the boundaries of different religious traditions and cultures. This is one of the most important contributions of the human rights ethos in a world simultaneously aware of its diversity and its increasing global interdependence. Because religious traditions articulate understandings of the ultimate meaning and purpose ofhuman activity, however, they will surely affect people's motives for respecting dignity and, in the end, will influence how believers interpret the full meaning of dignity and rights. At the same time, because understandings of human dignity and rights arrived at through practical reasoning specifY morally obligatory duties, they will have an impact on the ways religious traditions are interpreted. In other words, there is a mutually illuminating movement between the conclusions reached by practical reason about dignity and rights and the more theoretical orientations provided by the doctrines and beliefs of religious traditions.

This mutual illumination is evident in the way Catholicism grounds its affirmation of human dignity both in a theological understanding of the creation of human beings in God's image and in a more secular, philosophical understanding of human capacities. The theological approach begins from the biblical teaching in the book of Genesis that human beings are created in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1 :26). Persons possess a worth that deserves to be treated with the reverence shown to that which is holy. In the thirteenth century, Thomas Aquinas expressed this biblical perspective in a way that has notable parallels to Kant's affirmation that persons are ends in themselves. Aquinas wrote that of all the creatures in the universe, only humans are 'governed by divine providence for their own sakes' .20 In addition, Catholicism also draws on the further theological conviction that human beings have been redeemed and recreated in Christ to call for an even greater level of respect for dignity.21 These theological warrants lead to a strong commitment to defend human dignity, a commitment that the Second Vatican Council saw as :flowing from the gospel that is at the heart of Christian faith.22

The Catholic tradition also holds that human dignity can be recognized by all human beings and makes claims upon all, both Christian and non-Christian. This is very much in line with Catholicism's long-standing, natural lawbased conviction that ethical responsibilities can be grasped by human reason and philosophical reflection on what it is to be human. Thus, in addition to its explicitly theological grounding for human dignity, the Catholic tradition · offers secular warrants for its affirmation of human dignity. The Second Vatican Council not only invoked the theological theme of creation in the image of God as the basis of dignity but also argued that this dignity can be seen in the transcendent power of the human mind. Through their intellects, human beings transcend the material universe, and the mind's capacity to share in divine wisdom gives humans a worth that reflects God's. For the Council, human dignity is also manifest in the capacity of the human conscience to search for moral truth, and to adhere to it when it has been found. Obedience to the dictates of conscience-which is the deepest core and sanctuary of a person-'is the very dignity of the human person'. The Council further held that dignity is evident in the excellence of human liberty. Freedom is 'an exceptional sign of the divine image within the human person'. The dignity of freedom requires that persons act with free choice, and that they seek to direct their freedom through knowledge of the true good. 23

#### EXPERIENCE AND HISTORY, PRACTICAL REASON AND FAITH 135

These three secular warrants for human dignity-the transcendence of the mind, the sacredness of conscience, and the excellence of liberty-are all aspects of the power of human reason that is a prime manifestation of the likeness of humans to God. But because intellect, conscience, and liberty are rationally knowable through reflection on experience, they possess a certain autonomy from the doctrinal beliefs of the Church. This relative autonomy of the secular philosophical warrants for human dignity enabled thinkers such as Maritain and John Courtney Murray to rely upon them as a kind of fulcrum for the lever of their successful efforts to persuade the church to abandon its nineteenth-century rejection of the rights to freedom of conscience and religion. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, several popes had seen modem arguments for freedom of religion and thought as manifestations of relativism, and thus as threats to the truth of Christian faith. Before and at the Second Vatican Council, however, Maritain and Murray successfully argued that, through the reflection of practical reason: on the historical experience of modem democratic life, these freedoms could be seen to be true expressions of human dignity.24 Thus, practical reflection on experience led to a dramatic development of the Catholic stance on religious freedom and related human rights. It brought the Second Vatican Council not only to reject the nineteenth-century papacy's suspicion of human rights but to the ringing positive statement that 'the right to religious freedom has its foundation in the very dignity of the human person as this dignity is known through the revealed word of God and by reason itself' .25

The reciprocal movement between practical and theoretical reason, or between practice and faith, can therefore lead a religious tradition like Catholicism to reconsider and perhaps to revise its understanding of what humanity requires. The movement can also go the other way. It can lead a religious tradition to critique the understanding of human dignity prevailing in a culture or society by drawing on its deeper religious convictions to highlight aspects of human dignity that are being overlooked or denied. This critique of practical understanding in light of the convictions of faith has been evident in the way the Catholic tradition has stressed the communal and social dimensions of human

dignity in contrast with the more individualistic approaches common in much of the modem West. The Catholic tradition, for both theological and secular reasons, insists that human dignity cannot be reduced to an individualistic understanding of freedom. Freedom can only be realized in relationship and interaction with other persons. The ongoing exercise of personal freedom depends on the social interaction and social institutions that support such freedom.

The theological stress on the social dimensions of human dignity has several sources. The biblical story narrates how God's covenant draws those with faith into community and makes them 'a people'. Both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament teach that the commandment to love one's neighbour as oneself is a key norm in social life, thus making the call to solidarity central for both Jews and Christians. The Christian eschatological hope that human destiny is realized in a communion of saints reinforces these communal dimensions of human personhood. Further, Catholic tradition sees the image of God in persons as a reflection of a God that Christians believe is a Trinitarian union of three persons who are interrelated in mutual love. The God of Christian faith is not a monadic being isolated in sublime solitude but is radically relational. As images of this Trinitarian God, human persons are also relational. Human beings achieve their dignity only in communal solidarity with each other. As the Council put it, 'God did not create the human being as a solitary ... For by his innermost nature the human being is a social being, and unless he relates himself to others he can neither live nor develop his potential. ' 26

This theological understanding of human dignity as a relational reality also has secular warrants. For example, Vatican II cites Thomas Aquinas's appropriation of Aristotle's philosophical defence of the 'social nature' of the human person, which implies that the development of the person and the advance of society 'hinge on each other' and that each person 'stands completely in need of social life'. 27 Thus, on both theological and secular grounds, the dignity of the person can only be achieved when persons enter into fraternity and community with each other. Human dignity is not realized by persons acting autonomously on their own but through collaboration and solidarity. An individualistic ethic is thus inadequate in light of Catholicism's relational

understanding of human dignity. Protection of human dignity and realization of the common good go together. Neither personal flourishing nor communal well-being can be secured without the other.

This relational understanding of the image of God and of human dignity has important practical implications, particularly for the way human rights are understood. During the Cold War, the West was inclined to conceive human rights largely in individualistic terms, and to give priority to the civil and political rights to freedom of belief, speech, and association, as well as due process of law. The negative rights not to be interfered with often took primacy in the West in its ideological struggle with the Soviet bloc. In contrast, Eastern bloc nations and some in the southern hemisphere adopted ideologies stressing social interdependence and the priority of community provision over individual initiative. This led to granting priority to social and economic rights, such as those to adequate food, work, and housing.

The Catholic affirmation of the importance of freedom and the simultaneous claim that freedom is dependent on and realized in community leads to a rejection of the need to choose between the two types of rights. Neither individualistic understandings that see human rights primarily as rights to be left alone nor collectivist approaches that subordinate persons to the community in a totalitarian way are adequate. The Catholic tradition holds that opposition between individual freedoms on the one hand and mutual solidarity in society on the other is a false dichotomy. Persons can live in dignity only when they live in a community of freedom-a community in which both personal initiative and social solidarity are valued as essential aspects of human dignity.

Thus, the Catholic tradition will challenge understandings ofhuman rights that stress solely the protection of individual freedom in an economy based entirely on the free market. The free market can be productive and lead to economic growth. But the communal understanding of human dignity means that-the participation of all persons in the and economic life of society must be protected. If persons are left out of such participation, the market may need to be regulated or limited in order to guarantee the basic requirements of their dignity. In the context of current economic problems that have pushed many into poverty and unemployment, Pope Benedict stressed this when he stated that 'the worldwide financial breakdown has ... shown the error of the assumption that the market is capable of regulating itself, apart from public intervention and the support of internalized moral standards'. 28 This does not,

of course, mean that the Church endorses total state control of the economy. The communal understanding of dignity calls for a prudent blend of freedom and regulation in order to secure the agency of all through their participation in the dynamics of social and economic life. It calls for an approach to dignity and rights in which persons have political space for action (civil and political rights) and also the material and institutional prerequisites of communal life that make such action possible (social and economic rights). Thus, both civil-political and social-economic rights are required if human dignity is to be respected in its multiple aspects. This has opened the way for the Church to become an active voice for human dignity in the face of the problems raised both by free markets and by more centralized political systems as well.

Catholic understandings of human dignity and rights are thus shaped both by an inductive use of practical reason reflecting on experience and also on a more theoretical or imaginative vision of humanity shaped by Christian faith. Practical reason and faith play interacting roles in shaping the understanding of dignity. This interaction is itself a historical process. It led to notable revisions in the Catholic stance towards human rights, including religious freedom and democracy, ·where the Church moved from strong opposition to full support in the century from 1865 to 1965. This raises the question of whether further developments in the Catholic understanding of dignity and rights might be expected in the future. It also suggests that the question of possible continuing development in how dignity is understood needs to be faced in other religious traditions and in secular traditions as well.

Let me conclude by suggesting that the inductive role played by practical reason in formulating the concrete demands of human dignity means that we should expect our understanding of human rights to continue to change and develop. The historical nature of practical reason's reflection on experience can help us understand how the Catholic understanding of human dignity has developed in such notable ways over the past few centuries. It also suggests that we can expect developments in the Catholic understanding of human dignity and rights in the For example, recent Church teachings on the equality of men and 'Yomen is often accompanied by an affirmation of a complementarity of male and female gender roles that leads to a rejection of some of the rights claimed by persons involved in same-sex relationships. Similarly, recent Church teachings reject some innovative forms of medical and technological support for human reproduction as threats to human dignity.29 Clearly, affirming same-sex relationships and some forms of technologically assisted reproduction as supportive of human dignity would require notable shifts in

aspects of the Catholic moral tradition. Though this is not the place to assess these matters, developments in Catholic thought on such issues should not be ruled out a priori, for Catholic understandings of the requirements of human dignity have clearly changed in a number of other domains. These changes occurred when practical reason indicated they would serve the human good and promote human dignity. So, today, we need similar reflection on how human dignity might be affected by new practices in these areas.

In a recent reflection on the role oflslam in the world today, Pope Benedict stressed the role of reason in assessing whether particular religious visions of the moral life are to be judged to truly reflect God's intent for humanity. The Pope noted that some Muslims appeal to the Qur'an and to Islamic tradition to justify Muslim resort to holy war to advance the spread of Islam. But the Pope saw such resort to violence as contrary to God's intent precisely because it rejects the use of reason as a key component of authentic faith. Quoting the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Paleologus, the Pope stated that 'Not to act reasonably, not to act with *logos,* is contrary to the nature of God.' 30 In appealing to what he calls 'rationality of faith', the Pope was certainly not reducing faith to what can be known within the limits of reason alone. But he was clearly rejecting Muslim forms of holy war or *jihad* that fail to meet the kind of reasonable standards for the use of force that have become embodied in the tradition of just war, which combines practical human reasonableness with the Christian vision of the dignity of the person.

I would suggest that the Catholic tradition will be true to itself by being ready to apply similar standards of the 'rationality of faith' to the assessment of how human dignity is supported or threatened by the impact of shifting gender roles on same-sex relations, by technological interventions in human reproduction, and by other new and perhaps controversial forms of human interaction. Inductive reflection by practical reason on these issues may well lead us to conclude that traditional practices are the appropriate ways to continue to support human dignity. But it is possible that such reflection may suggest that change in traditional standards is the best way to secure human dignity. Human dignity raises ongoing challenges for all traditions of moral reflection. We can expect Catholicism to be an active participant in the efforts to respond to these challenges.
