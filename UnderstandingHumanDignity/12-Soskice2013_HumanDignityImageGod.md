# **Human Dignity and the Image of God**

#### *Janet Soskice*

IN PRESS REPORTS, CHRISTIAN, and especially Roman Catholic, teachings on issues of life and death make their appearance as so many staccato dictates emanating from the moon or (from what is for Fleet Street an even more remote and inexplicable place of origin) the Vatican. Catholics (good Catholics) follow these dictates unwittingly because that is what it means to be a good Catholic. There is, then, little point in asking good Catholics what they think about things since they don't think; they only follow and adhere.

In fact, Christian teaching, including Catholic teaching, is rooted in centuries and even millennia of reflection on God, the world, and the human condition (anthropology). These beliefs and teachings have in tum give risen to deeply felt convictions about respect for the unborn, the elderly, the ill, imprisoned, and the dying that are by no means knee-jerk. In this chapter I want to explore Christian teaching about God, Christ, and creation, particularly as they reflect on the dignity ofhuman beings made 'in the image of God'.

### Creation and salvation

The Christian God (and traditionally the Jewish and Muslim God) creates all that is, including space and time. This means that everything ('all that is') is good. 1 Contrary to what might be our lived experience, God has made and loves his creation, and evil has, at least in the classical theology of Augustine and Aquinas and others, no ontological reality of its own, but must be seen as lack. In creating 'all that is', God both loves and is close to his creatures (spiritual, rational, vegetable, and mineral) immediately as their Creator. Since God created time, creation is not what happened some distant ages ago, but from

<sup>1</sup> It is better to say that God creates 'all that is' than to say God creates 'the world" or 'the Universe', because in this teaching, were there for instance to be multi verses, God would be the creator ofthem, too. God creates simply everything, and everything that is not God is a creature.

God's point of view 'now'. God is at this very moment holding all that is in being, and were God not to do this for even a micro-second it would not be. God is accordingly entirely intimate to creatures, closer to me than my own hands and feet, as Augustine and John Henry Newman would say.

All things have their being in and from God (without themselves 'being God'-this is not a kind ofpanentheism). All things find their destiny, or *telos,*  in the divine love. Living beings, unlike stones, are also moving and growing beings. Irrational living beings, like flowers, will unwaveringly follow their own good by a 'natural love'. Sunflowers will turn to the sunlight because naturally they seek to flourish. Human beings, as reasoning beings, are capable of going wrong in spectacular ways, but nonetheless they too seek to flourish. Thus 'salvation' is derived from *'sal us',* health. Aquinas argued that all human beings seek their salvation, or, as *salus* is sometimes translated, their 'human flourishing'. For Aquinas, even in their animal natures human beings are rightly guided by 'natural love'. It is, for him, our misuse of reason, and not our bodily natures, which leads us astray. Dante is a powerful exponent of this view, and I can do no better than direct the reader to a speech in the *Purgatorio*  where Virgil contrasts 'natural love' and 'mind love', and the comment on this of the translator, Robin Kirkpatrick,

> *The natural love can never go astray. The other, though, may err when wrongly aimed, or else through too much vigour or the lack.*

#### Kirkpatrick writes:

To speak of a 'natural' love would, according to some moralists, imply a base instinct that should in some way be repressed by the conscious mind. But this is not at all Dante's view. Natural love is the instinctual will, the urge to live and to sustain oneself in the existence that the Creator has first granted. This form of love operates in all created things-whether rational or animal or vegetable-and provides an unwavering compass point, directed always towards the development of life, which is never capable of going astray. Desire here, as throughout the *Paradiso* also, is seen as being, on every level, the innate drive that impels all existing things-whether bees as they make honey or fire as it rises *(Purgatorio* 18:28) or fire rising in flame *(Paradiso* l: 115-17)-towards their proper goal, which is to nurture the full capacity for life with which they have been endowed. All things in existence desire what is good. And 'good' means nothing more nor less that the nourishment that is appropriate to any particular form of life.2

2 Robin Kirkpatrick, Introduction to *Dante Purgatorio,* trans. Robin Kirkpatrick (London, Penguin, 2007), xxxii.

Human beings, having free will, can go astray, but they can also, as Kirkpatrick points out, 'seek fulfilment in the sphere of intellectual good with the same zeal that the bee (or even, say, beetroot) seeks fulfilment in its own sphere of existence. If the human being succeeds in this, it will then freely be given credit for collaboration with the creation that the Creator intended it to enjoy. No bee or vegetable will receive such credit. (Nor will any bee or vegetable be condemned for failing to pursue its existential destiny.)' 3

To seek God, to seek to flourish, and to seek the good are for Dante and Aquinas, whom he here follows, entirely natural to us. Nature is not, of course, for these thinkers something existing alongside of and in some way independent of God, as we seem to find in Newton or in Locke. Christians do not believe in 'nature' in its early modem sense but in 'creation'. Human nature is the nature created by God and the moral life is not rule following, but formation in virtue always brings us closer to our own good. Philosophical readers will recognize this as the Thomistic and Aristotelian synthesis that Alasdair Macintyre has done much to recover. In its theological form it is profoundly organic and teleological. Life, all creation, finds its wholeness and life in and from God.

# The 'sanctity oflife' and the 'image of God'

All life, all creation, is loved by God, and the lives of irrational creatures seem, from the biblical record, to matter to God. In that sense, all life has a 'sanctity'. Laws on the slaughter of animals in the Old Testament and modem Jewish and Muslim practice reflect the honour which animal life should be accorded even while taking it. The reason given for prohibition on drinking blood in Leviticus 17 is that blood is 'the life' of the animal.

The media and even the Churches, when addressing the question of Christian teachings on life and death, often today invoke the notion of 'the sanctity of life'. As well as being ambiguous (are animals included? what about viruses?), this phrasing has, as far as I can see, no fixed biblical root or deep presence in historical theology. Where reverence for human life is concerned, the directive biblical teaching is that the human being is made 'in the image of God', a teaching drawn from Judaism but which becomes much more potent in Christian teaching. I will return to the *imago Dei* later, but for the moment note that it has been the basis in Christian teaching for regarding

<sup>3</sup> Robin Kirkpatrick, Introduction to *Dante Purgatorio,* xxxiii.

every human being, no matter how poor, burdened, restricted, ragged, or dissolute, as entirely distinctive and worthy of reverence.

# Disability and the end of life

The New Testament has a complex attitude to physical disability, illness, suffering, and death. These are not to be seen as punishment for sin. The decisive text for this has been the Gospel of John 9.2, where the disciples ask Jesus, 'Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?', to which Jesus answers, 'Neither this man nor his parents sinned; he was born blind so that God's works might be revealed in him' (Jn. 9.2-3, NRSV).4

On the other hand, death is an enemy, and one that Paul believes Jesus Christ, in dying and being raised from the dead, has defeated (2 Tim. 1.10). The Easter services in Christian churches proclaim that by his dying Christ conquered death. The author of the letter known as Hebrews identifies death with the devil, arguing that Jesus shared our flesh and blood, 'so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death' (Heb. 2.14). Pain in the New Testament appears not as the will of God but the work of the devil (although God mysteriously 'allows' pain). A general picture may be discerned of a world that is disordered, out of line, and which suffers and groans, awaiting its day of salvation. Individual suffering is not necessarily to be explained by individual wrongdoing, but our individual wrongdoings contribute to corporate disorder.

The ministry of Jesus was characterized by healings from sickness (Matt. 9.35), raising from the dead, and casting out of unclean spirits. According to the Gospel writers, his disciples were called to share this work (Matt. 10.1 ), even to the point of raising the dead.

It is probably anachronistic to think that the marvel of these healings lay, for the gospel writers and their audiences, in their apparent violation of the laws of nature. At the time of Jesus and Paul, the general public had no difficulty believing in miraculous cures. The Gospels themselves suggest that people other than Jesus and his followers could heal and cast out demons. The significance of Jesus's healing miracles for the New Testament writers lies not in their uniqueness but in their perceived role as signs of the in-breaking

<sup>4</sup> It is interesting that it is Jesus's own disciples, and not the Pharisees or some other rival group, who are represented as presenting Jesus with this unsatisfactory either/or. This seems to show that it was by no means a silly question.

of a new reign (or kingdom) of God, with Jesus as the anticipated Messiah. Thus when, in Matthew's Gospel, the imprisoned John the Baptist sends his followers to ask Jesus, 'Are you the one who is to come, or are we to wait for another?', Jesus answers with direct reference to the Old Testament prophet, Isaiah: 'Go and tell John what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them' (Matt. 11.2-5). 5 The disciples share in this healing ministry.

But healing is not only by prayer and miracle. The Parable of the Good Samaritan of Luke 10 was of decisive importance to the theologians of the early church. In this story, a traveller is beaten up and left for dead on the road to Jericho. A priest and a Levite, both members of respected Jewish groups, pass the wounded man without wanting to be bothered by stopping. A member of the despised Samaritan community then comes along, takes compassion on the victim, binds his wounds and makes arrangements for him to be looked after at an inn at the Samaritan's own expense. In conclusion, Jesus asks his disciples which one of these men was the neighbour to the fallen man. The story was important in early Christian teaching not least because it was understood to speak allegorically about Jesus himself: Jesus himself was seen to be the one who stopped to assist the man who had been beaten, robbed, and left half dead on the road to Jericho. The oil and wine used by the Samaritan to dress the wounds anticipate the bread and wine of the Christian sacraments. Jesus was the 'true Physician' whose gifts of bread and wine (his body and blood) were the true medicaments. Other medications, however, were equally important, and on a less allegorical level the Parable of the Good Samaritan was, and is, understood to suggest that care for the stranger should be blind to merit, kinship, or gain. Nor is there any question of the Samaritan requiring of the victim (presumably a Jew, since he was coming down from Jerusalem) any conversion, or even thanks. This was the answer Jesus gave to the question 'And who is my neighbour?' (Lk. 10.29). In many ways Christian admonitions to care of the poor, suffering, and needy were simply continuations of Jewish ones: care for the widows and orphans, the stranger ('hospice' and 'hospital' derive from the Latin for hospitality), but the early Christians also believed that Jesus would return, even within their lifetime, to inaugurate his new kingdom, and consequently felt an 'end of times' urgency which informed their practice.

5 Compare Isaiah 29 .18-19; also the Magnificat of Luke 1.

This was noted by others. The philosopher and convert Aristides, in an Apology delivered on behalf of the Christians to the emperor in the first part of the second century gives this summary oflife among the Christians:

> when they see a stranger, they take him in to their homes and rejoice over him as a very brother; for they do not call them brethren after the flesh, but brethren after the spirit and in God ... And if there is among them any that is poor and needy, and if they have no spare food, they fast two or three days in order to supply to the needy their lack of food. They observe the precepts of their Messiah with much care, living justly and soberly as the Lord their God commanded them. 6

The end of time was delayed, but care for the poor and sick continued. Guenter Risse in his history of hospitals, *Mending Bodies, Saving Souls,* discusses at length the calamity that hit Edessa, in what is now Eastern Turkey, in 499. Droughts, agricultural failure, and plagues emptied the villages. Those who could walk fled to the cities, where they begged and died in great numbers. The bishop, Eusebius, went personally to the emperor in Constantinople to appeal emergency funds and supplies for these newcomers, who were to be found 'wailing by night and day from the pangs of hunger, and their bodies wasted away ... the whole city was full of them and they began to die in the porticoes and in the streets' .7 Joshua the Sty lite, who chronicled the unfolding disaster, wrote of dead bodies of women and children in the streets, and that two priests 'established an infirmary among the buildings attached to the Great Church of Edessa. Those who were very ill used to go in and lie down there; and many bodies were found in the infirmary in which they were buried. ' 8 Despite this and other measures from church and community leaders and Greek soldiers, many of those in the infirmaries still 'died by a painful and melancholy death', although surrounded by those devoted to their care' .9

# Christ, the image of the invisible God

Christians believe that Jesus was not just a messenger of God or another prophet but God Godself, dwelling with humankind in the flesh. St Paul in his letters reconfigured the notion of *imago Dei* received from the Book of

Genesis along the lines of this new faith. The Book of Genesis taught that the human being was made 'in the image of God'. Paul takes this teaching in a new direction by identifying Jesus as the true image, indeed 'the image of the invisible God' (Col. 1.15; see also 2 Cor. 4.4).

The nature of the 'image of God' has been glossed in different ways by theologians, and indeed by rabbis. Since it is not in the virtue of the body that the human being is 'in the image of God', some have focused on rationality, others on our capacity for speech. However, it is evident that these capacities have not been judged definitive in the individual case, since even the prelinguistic infant and dying elderly person in extreme decline has been held to be 'in the image of God'. A certain vagueness is indeed desirable and ineliminable in the notion-it is not in virtue of possessing a particular set of qualifications that the human individual is in the image of God. *Imago Dei*  would seem to be, as is perhaps the notion of human dignity itself, a placeholder concept *par excellence,* and nothing wrong with that if what is needed from a concept is placeholding. 10

Among the Eastern Orthodox, one reading of the *imago Dei* is that, since God is mystery, so the human being made in the image of God is also mystery. This reading is supported Christologically by the Western theologians like Bernard ofClairvaux who cite I John 3.2. 'My dear people, we are already the children of God but what we are to be in the future has not yet been revealed; all we know is, that when it is revealed we shall be like him because we shall see him as he really is.' The idea is that as the fullness of Christ, the true image, is not yet known, nor yet is our own true nature.

Decisively for the moral and social life, it wa:s held that whatever is done for anyone in need is done for Christ. A central text here has been Matthew 25, sometimes called the Last Judgement. In the course of a long sequence of teaching on the kingdom of heaven, Jesus says:

> Then the king will say to those at his right hand, 'Come, you that are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me something to drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, I was naked and you gave me clothing, I was sick and you take care of me, I was in prison and you visited me'. (Matt. 25.34-6)

Jesus tells his puzzled audience that whatever service they do for the 'least of his brethren' they do for him. This scripture has been foundational to the

<sup>10</sup> Here I am one with David Gushee in wanting to avoid a list of qualities that 'qualifies' a human being for respect. And in case *imago Dei* is mistakenly taken as suggesting that human beings are more spiritual than other creatures, it is worth reminding ourselves that, classically, angels were thought to be entirely spiritual creatures but never, like human beings, held to be in the image of God.

Christian conviction that one should see Christ in every person in need. The encounter of St Francis with the lepers, the founding of the hospice movement by Cicely Saunders (an evangelical Anglican), and the work of Mother Theresa of Calcutta are three memorable instances.

Jesus, understood by Christians to be the author of life (the one through whom all things were made according to the Prologue to John's Gospel) did not save himself from death. Indeed, he died a particularly painful and humiliating death. This tortured death is often represented in Christian art, sometimes to the consternation of modem viewers. One of the most shocking images is that on the Isenheim altarpiece (1512-16) of Matthias Griinewald. When the altarpiece wings are closed, the viewer is confronted with a savage portrayal of lifeless Christ on the cross: his body is not only wounded but gaunt, pallid, and covered with sores. The distortion of the body, almost to the point of decomposition, is far in excess of the trauma a body would suffer in death by crucifixion. Yet we cannot 'see' this painting without knowing that the altarpiece was painted for a hospice chapel. The order of monks to whom it belonged, the Antonites, was founded to care for the sick, especially by establishing hospices. At Isenheim, the community was famous for their work with those suffering from skin diseases and especially *ignis plaga,* or St Anthony's Fire-ergotism. By the late sixteenth century, the cause of this disorder was known to be poisoned rye, but at the time Grunewald executed his commission its cause was unknown. Victims had blackened limbs, gangrenous hands and feet, and suffered deforming muscular spasms. 11 Before this altarpiece, the ailing could map their own physical distress and disfigurement on that of the body of their crucified God-as could those who were caring for them. When the panels were opened they could see a gloriously risen Christ, his skin freed from sores, though the body still bearing the wounds of his crucifixion.

#### Resurrection and life after death

Death is not the end in the Christian story. For the writers of the Gospels, and especially for St Paul and the theologians ofthe early church, the resurrection of Jesus from the dead was the essence of the 'good news', and bound up with the promise that his followers, too, would be raised to eternal life. The Book of Acts describes the disciples, after the death of Jesus, proclaiming the

<sup>11</sup> Andree Haym, *The Isenheim Altarpiece: God's Medicine and the Painter's Vision* (Princeton, NJ, Princeton University Press, 1989), 20--1.

resurrection of the dead in Jesus (Acts 4.2). St Paul makes the resurrection of Jesus central to his teaching and to Christian hope: 'If Christ has not been raised,' he writes in I Corinthians, 'your faith is futile and you are still in your sins' (I Cor. 15.17). For Paul, belief that Jesus was the promised Messiah was inseparable from belief in his Resurrection, and Christian hope for life after death was inseparable from belief that Jesus was the Messiah.

It is not clear exactly when the notion of the resurrection of the dead first became a debating point amongst the Jews as certainly it was between the Pharisees (who favoured the notion) and the Sadducees (who did not) at the time of the writing of the Gospels. Jon Levenson argues persuasively that the early rabbis were keen to find endorsement for the belief that the just would be raised on Judgement Day, and that they did so believing this to be in line with received Jewish teaching--even mandated by Torah. 12 A Jewish text written in the late second century BCE, 2 Maccabees, tells the harrowing story of a mother arrested with her seven sons whom the king attempts to force to eat pork. They declare that they would rather die than break the laws of their ancestors, and one by one are tortured and slain in front of their mother. The first, before having his limbs cut off and being fried alive in a pan, cites Moses: the LORD 'will have compassion on his servants' (2 Mac. 7.6); the second, before dying in a similarly dreadful way, says that 'the King of the universe will raise us up to an everlasting renewal of life, because we have died for his laws' (2 Mac.7.9); and so on, each expressing belief in resurrection to life.

It is not a coincidence that the same period in which we see evidence of belief in the 'raising ofthe dead' also saw developments in Jewish thought on creation, and particularly the consolidation of the belief in *creatio ex nihilo.*  This teaching underscores that God freely creates everything, including time and space. We find in 2 Maccabees fairly clear insistence on the staples of *creatio ex nihilo,* in consort with growing interest in the possibility of resurrection-----the mother ofthe seven martyred sons, for instance, expressly identifies the God who creates with the God that can restore to new life. In 2 Maccabees 7.28-9, she encourages her youngest son: 'I beg you, my child, to look at the heaven and earth and see everything that is in them, and recognize that God did not make them out of things that existed. And in the same way the human race came into being. Do not fear this butcher, but prove worthy of your brothers. Accept death, so that in God's mercy I may get you back again along with your brothers.' The connection is between a God who creates and a God

who saves. Just as God made all that is in the first place, so God can raise from the dead. 13 The themes were not new-the Book of Psalms and Isaiah both have creation as a central theme, and connect it with restoration and justice. The God who creates can save. 14 For the modem reader it is also worth. emphasizing that belief in life after death, while it may be *inconceivable* (so is the 'state' of the Universe before the big bang) is not *incoherent.* A related parallel is this: it is impossible to answer the question 'why is there something rather than nothing?' but this is not an absurd question. It is a metaphysical (not a scientific) question, which believers answer by saying that they believe in a Creator. Indeed, it would seem to me curious if someone had no difficulty believing that God made all that is, including space and time, but drewthe line at believing in life after death. After making space and time, the resurrection of the dead would seem to be a modest operation.

It was in this context of Messianic expectation, persecution, and hope that Christianity was born. For the writers of the New Testament, and especially for Paul, belief in the resurrection of the dead is of a piece with expectation for a Messiah who was to bring justice to the poor and food for the hungrythe themes of the Magnificat, the song sung by Mary, mother of Jesus, in the opening chapter of the Gospel of Luke. Luke and the other gospel writers draw on Isaiah for 'prophecies' of the one who restore sight to the blind and make the lame walk again. Jesus's miracles, including those in which he raises people from the dead, show him as participating in the power of the Creator (Lazarus in John 11, Jairus's daughter in Luke 8). The Prologue to John's Gospel goes so far as to identify Jesus with the creative power of God as the Word, through whom all things were made.

Resurrection in the New Testament is thus not best seen as a private reward for a the individual life lived well but as a sign ofthe even greater glory ofthe coming of the kingdom of God, a time ofhealing and justice when even the dead are not forgotten-thus St Paul:

> For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom. 8.38-9)

The collective 'us' is important here, for Paul sees all the faithful as members of the one body of Christ, stones that go to build a living temple to be

<sup>13</sup> Islamic texts use the same arguinent.

<sup>14</sup> This hope is in the Jewish prayer, the *Arnidah,* which according to Rabbinic law is to be said three days each weekday and four times on Sabbath: 'You are mighty forever, my Lord, You are the one who revives the dead, powerful to save (YOU make the wind blow and the rain fall) ... Faithful you are to revive the dead. Blessed are You, 0 Lord, who revive the dead.'

the dwelling place of God. In Romans, Paul suggests that the redeeming of our bodies might be but a part of a restoration of creation: 'We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now: and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies' (Rom. 8.22-3).

Jesus tells his disciples to 'cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons', and, as they go, to 'proclaim the good news, "The kingdom of heaven has come near"' (Matt. 10.7-8; compare Lk. 10.9). Caring for the sick, the outcast, the poor is *not what one does to earn ones way into an afterlife* but a sign that, however partially, the follower of Christ is already in some way sharing in the kingdom of God. In its biblical context, the Christian belief in the resurrection of the body is not to be uncoupled from hope for the coming of the kingdom, and the exercise of justice and mercy in working for this great end.

### Conclusions and applications

This, then, is a sketch of the scriptural and theological background to Christian teachings on human dignity in matters oflife and death-and not just that, for we can see that care of the outcast, the impoverished, the disabled, and imprisoned arises from the same interanimating beliefs. These beliefs, which traverse the grand narrative of creation and redemption, are entirely central to Christian faith and hope. While there are correspondences between ancient philosophical wisdoms and Christian teaching, the revolution affected by Abrahamic teaching in the world of classical antiquity cannot be exaggerated.

Creation is a case in point. Neither Plato nor Aristotle have a creator God. Bothare monotheists of a sort, but neither has anything like the Jewish or Christian creator. Aristotle's God is more like a mathematical theorem running alongside the universe. The Christian God by contrast (and where I say Christian read Christian, Jewish, and Muslim) has no need to create, and creates all that is freely and out of love. Aristotle's God has no knowledge of particulars, is not personal in any sense, and certainly not 'loving' (grossly anthropomorphic in Aristotle's austere scheme). The Abrahamic teaching that God creates everything has the radical implication that God is always already there-at every place, in any time-present to every creature all of which only and always have their being from God.

Of course Christians were keen to marry their wisdom with the best of what they found around them from the philosophers, but they transformed

them in the process. The Hippocratic oath could be embraced but it was also supplemented. David Albert Jones points out in his chapter in this volume that the ancient philosophers had views about human dignity, friendship, and so on, but they certainly did not hold that all human beings were of equal dignity. Aristotle thought women had only undeveloped souls, and slaves no souls at all. Cicero may have shared with other ancients the idea of *philanthropia,* 15 but he also held that a man could only be friend to someone who was his social and economic equal, and certainly not with a slave or a woman. Thomas Jefferson may have thought it was self evident that all men were created equal, but a short read of the authors of classical antiquity might have robbed him of this confident assertion. It is not at all self-evident that all men are created equal-and even Jefferson and the drafters of the Declaration didn't effectively include women.

Christianity, for all its shortcomings, brought into antiquity and the subsequent Western intellectual tradition a radical notion concerning the dignity of all human beings, even if the societal ramifications have taken time to unfold.16 Indeed, it is difficult to see how so counter-intuitive a notion as that of the equal dignity of all human beings could have entered the Western intellectual bloodstream apart from the influence of this Abrahamic strand, and sometimes hard to see how it can be maintained apart from it.17

The human being, each human being, whether a king or a milkmaid, is loved by God in their own particularity. Each life is a gift, and each human person is one who is in the image of God, in whose face we should see the face of Christ-witness the St Christopher legend, and many other similar tales of assisting Christ unawares.

As God is mystery, so each human being made in the image of God is a mystery. It is this, not respect for nature, which is the bedrock for Christian teachings about matters of life and death: debates- about abortion, assisted suicide, and, we could add, euthanasia (for which I believe there is a growing pressure) and infanticide.18 A 'respect for nature' is perfectly compatible with eugenic policies that sterilize or kill the infirm, the disabled, or members of ethnic minorities. Indeed, respect for nature and purity of bloodline

18 That the Christian position for this complex question cannot always be simply read off this conviction is evident in the different Christian stances taken on questions of contraception and abortion.

has frequently been invoked to endorse such measures. A respect for nature underlies some animal rights or deep green groups who, at least in rhetoric, are happy to countenance the elimination of many resource-grabbing human beings. Peter Singer's willingness to countenance infanticide for unwanted children is of a piece with his championing of animallife. 19

From the Christian point of view, every human being is in the image of God and thus to be respected as a sacred mystery. God has brought them into being and is working his purpose out in their life. Of course 'the' Christian position on many complex issues can't always simply be read off this conviction, and here I think the notion of *imago Dei* and the attendant mystery that implies has many advantages over the idea of 'sanctity of life'. From the Catholic perspective, we must rest with the mystery of the origins of life. We do not rest easily with mystery, yet rest we must. When do the individual egg and sperm become not just human life but a single human life? At conception? After the possibility of twinning has past? We don't know, and from the Roman Catholic point of view it does not matter, since this life has come as a gift and should be accepted in its mysterious unfolding as gift.

We need also to keep in mind the reality and prevalence of miscarriages. I have had a miscarriage at an early stage of pregnancy, and learned then that these are very common. I was told that the 'product of conception' I had carried could never have been a baby, although it was a human conception, of course. It was a loss, a very great loss, and there were many tears, for my husband and I had already been thinking that seven months or so from that time we would have a baby. But it was not, at this stage, the death of a child. Nor indeed does the Catholic Church mark miscarriage as such. The fact that no liturgy has been developed and put in place for early miscarriage may be taken as a indicator that the Church has always noted the ambiguities of early pregnancy-and not simply because it was not clearly understood, in medieval times, that the early embryo was human.

This loss, which often takes place at three months of gestation, is often known only to the couple and even more frequently, we are told, not even known to the woman herself if the fertilized egg is lost in the first month. Given the frequency of early miscarriage, it is almost impossible, religiously, to regard it as a God-directed slaughter of the innocents. Instead, it seems more natural to say that the mystery of this new life is beyond us. In my case, had the pregnancy which miscarried gone to full term I would not have conceived

I have written about this in Janet Soskice, *The Kindness of God* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2007}, ch. 3, 'Creation and relation'. Chapter 2 of that book concerns the *imago Dei.* 

the daughter I now have, since the successful pregnancy began during what would have been the term of the previous, miscarried one.

From a Catholic perspective, respect for the earliest life as 'in *imago dei'*  means living with the mystery of a divine gift, even where we cannot see how . this is so. The same sense of mystery and dignity which causes us to respect the early embryo should protect the convicted murderer whose sins and supplications are known, in the end, only to God. It should cause us to pause before the senile and demented and the drug-addicted for the same reason, and lead us to clothe the poor, aid the sick, and visit the prisoner, for these, too, are 'the least' in which nonetheless Christ is present.

Sergio Dellavalle has expressed concern about the 'possible parochialism' of the language of *imago Dei.* I grant that the notion, especially as expanded in terms of the face of Christ, is specific to a faith tradition and in that sense parochial. Were the nature of the parochialism such that it restricted need to care and attention only to those who were members of the Christian community, this would be an abhorrent teaching. But it does not and never has restricted the command to care just to Christians. I personally prefer the honesty, as a Christian, of invoking an openly Christ-focused notion *imago Dei*  over the seemingly more neutral (but actually opaquely religious) 'sanctity of human life', a notion which trades (but how?) on some religious legacy but which is now so broad as to be used by all.2° Furthermore, the idea of *imago Dei,* especially as developed with reference to Christ as the image after whom all human beings are made, keeps in place the sense of mystery and modesty before 'the other' which should be at the ground of our respect for the dignity of other persons. On the other hand, sanctity of life, especially as currently volatilized in American political debate, runs the risk of becoming one of those hegemonic concepts so feared by Costas Douzinas. It is better, in my view, to admit a parochialism at the outset-to say this comes from my Christian and Catholic convictions-than to cloak a religious view in would-be universal secularity. It should be clear that to focus on the *imago Dei* is in no way to depart from the Catholic teaching that all human life is to be protected, but equally it should guard against an unbalanced focus on life issues (that is, beginning and end of life) at the cost of ignoring the wider needs of those 'divine images' whose struggling lives are lived out before us.

Of inestimable importance to the Christian message, a lesson it takes from Judaism and underscored in this chapter, is attention to particularity.

<sup>20</sup> Emily Jackson, in her reply to my paper at the conference, mentioned Ronald Dworkin as invoking a shared conviction in the intrinsic sanctity of human life, based not only in religious views but derived from the miracle of creation. Both 'sanctity' and 'creation' would seem to be used figuratively here, since it seems on the face of it incoherent to speak of a 'creation' without a 'creator'.

Here one could especially think of assisted suicide. For a Christian, there is no point in a life which is without hope or without the possibility of growth. God's grace knows no bounds, and blessings may come from situations of what look to us to be direst despairY Christians cannot expect the rest of the population to share this belief, but they may at least be able to understand where it comes from.

Each individual, whether Christian or not, believer or not, an AIDS sufferer or not, senile or not, is in the image of God and must be respected as such. As with some other religious traditions, loss of sight and speech is not understood as failure to somehow be present. No individual life should be judged, even by its bearer, to be worthless. This is not to say that extraordinary measures should be made to keep a dying person alive. Yet a dying person, however frail, silent, and physically or mentally disabled may be 'living and active' in ways invisible to us but apparent to God. The song of the elderly Zechariah speaks of being delivered by God to 'serve him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life' (Lk 1.73-5). Death is not to be avoided at all cost. The most extreme serving of God recorded in the New Testament is the death, or passion, of Christ on the cross. It is a matter of Christian faith that all human life, no matter how weakened or debilitated, is still a life in which grace is at work-a belief that needs to be cherished in our performance-driven society.

<sup>21</sup> Of course, in public debate we are not dealing with a population that is Christian. In the secular sphere I would certainly invoke, to support prohibition of euthanasia, duty of care to the physicians and the vulnerability of the elderly to the pressure to end their lives.
