# **Human Dignity in the Jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights**

### *Jean-Paul Costa1*

Tms coNTRIBUTION AIMS TO describe the adoption and use of the concept of human dignity in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, the oldest and most important international tribunal in the world dealing with human rights issues and cases. Dignity, or human dignity, is often the foundation of the legal reasoning of the Strasbourg Court in its rulings. It was not at all obvious that this would happen: the text of the European Convention on Human Rights,2 on which the Court's jurisprudence is based, does not mention dignity at all. Despite this, the use of that concept is engaged in many types of human rights violations. But recourse to it is never self-evident in the choice of reasoning of the rulings made by the Court. That is why it is worth reflecting on that practice, and ultimately about the philosophical and legal links between human dignity and human rights.

### A surprising absence in the basic text

The ws>rd 'dignity' is not only quoted but given pride of place in the first sentence of the Preamble of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 3 and it appears again in Article 1, and in Article 23.3 of the Declaration. It is less well known that the word had been already used, in one of its first sentences, by the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, adopted a few months *before* the Universal Declaration. Similarly, the two international Covenants of 1966, which develop, and make enforceable, the

<sup>2</sup> Its official title is the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

<sup>3 &#</sup>x27;Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world ... '

Universal Declaration's provisions, solemnly speak of the 'inherent dignity of the human person'.

While those instruments grant dignity a prominent role in the foundation of, or basis for, human rights, and while some European texts do the same (such as the European Social Charter, 1961, and, more recently, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, 2000),4 the European Convention on Human Rights, signed on 4 November 1950, is absolutely silent about dignity. Neither the Convention itself nor the Protocols to the Convention use that word or expression.

Why this is so is not clear. The *'travaux preparatoires'* of the Convention, especially the debates in the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe in 1949-50, do not provide an obvious explanation. The absence of dignity is surprising, the more so if one considers that the text of the European Convention is in many respects very close to that of the Universal Declaration. Most of the rights guaranteed in the Convention are analogous to at least a part of the rights proclaimed by the Declaration. One hypothesis-the author here expresses his own personal ideas-could be that the Convention is a more practical, pragmatic, and mechanism-oriented text than that of the Declaration: it created a commission and a court, and provided for procedural ways and means for bringing a case to Strasbourg, and how these cases have to be settled.

It is likely that the drafters nevertheless had the concept of dignity in their minds, especially because the very establishment of the Council of Europe in 1949 and the elaboration of the Convention, the first treaty prepared within its framework, were the work of persons firmly opposed to the atrocities and barbarity of the Second World War. The founding fathers of the European system of protection of rights and freedoms shared the same philosophy as the authors of the Universal Declaration. Very probably, however, their intention was not to use solemn, emphatic language, but instead to concentrate on more practical, even technical issues.

<sup>4</sup> Significantly, Chapter I of the Charter is dealing with 'Dignity'. It includes five articles. Article I reads as follows: 'Human dignity is inviolable. It must be respected and protected.' Articles 2 to 5 guarantee, respectively, right to life, including the prohibition of death penalty, right to the integrity of the person, including in the fields of medicine and biology, prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatments, and prohibition of slavery and forced labour, including trafficking of human beings. The Charter, which has been legally binding for the member states of the EU since 1 December 2009, together with the entry into force ofthe·Lisbon Treaty, is clearly more complete and modem than the European Convention of Human Rights, adopted half a century before it.

# Re-appearance of dignity in the case-law

It is difficult to ascertain when, for the first time, the Convention bodies had recourse to the concept of dignity. In the *Courts* case law, the leading judgment is usually said to be *Tyrer v United Kingdom, 5* a case about judicial corporal punishment inflicted on a fifteen-year-old pupil in the Isle of Man. According to the Court, the penalty, and the conditions of its execution, and their indignity, amounted if not to inhuman at least to degrading treatment under Article 3 of the Convention, which therefore had been violated. So *Tyrer*  seems to be a pioneer judgment.6

However, in a report dated December 1973, more than four years before *Tyrer,* the European Commission of Human Rights had already addressed the issue of human dignity. The Commission stated that racial discrimination could constitute a breach of human dignity.7 It is noticeable that discrimination, even on racial or ethnic grounds, normally constitutes a violation of Article 14 of the Convention (the principle of equality), not of Article 3, which prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment. This very first example of the use of the term dignity shows that the Commission,8 and the Court subsequently, have never restricted their recourse to dignity solely to Article 3, even if it is the field where it is most frequently applied. The approach followed by the Commission in that particular case, namely that racial discrimination is, or may be, an offence to human dignity, has been influential, and was eventually confirmed by the Court itself.9 A noteworthy example is seen in the inter-state case of *Cyprus v Turkey,* 10 in which discrimination against the Karpas Greek Cypriots was held to constitute a 'violation of the very notion of human dignity', and breached Article 3 of the Convention. 11

6 *'/jlrer* was followed, under Article 2 of Protocol 1, which protects the right to education, by *Campbell and Cosans v UK,* 25 February 1982, again about corporal punishment in a school, in Scotland.

7 *East African Asians v UK,* opinion, 27 December 1973.

8 The European Commission of Human Rights, which produced a high number of decisions, opinions and reports, and played a very important role in the first phase of the system based on the European Convention on Human Rights, disappeared in 1998 with the entry into force of Protocol II to the Convention. Protocol II has changed the Court into a single, permanent body. It is a radical modification of the system, the most important since 1950.

9 See for instance *Nachova v Bulgaria,* Grand Chamber judgment, 6 July 2005; the complaints of the applicants were under Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention, and Article 14 as well.

# Examples of recourse to human dignity: Articles 2, 3, and 4

Most of the cases where the Court has decided a case on the basis of an offence against human dignity are cases arising under Article 3. Many of these cases deal with disproportionate use of physical force against people in vulnerable situations, such as people arrested by the police or detained in a cell. The general principle is that when a person is deprived ofliberty, any recourse to physical force which is not strictly necessary diminishes human dignity, and is in principle an infringement of Article 3. 12 So, for example, in *Tekin v Turkey,* 13 a person had been held in a cold, dark cell, and so mistreated that wounds and bruises were left on his body. In *Selmouni v France,* a person held in custody in a police station had been very seriously injured by the police officers. 14 In both cases, the Court used dignity language in holding that there had been a violation of Article 3.

The Court has also found that human dignity, and the principles of medical ethics, are breached in a case where a detained person, seriously ill with cancer, had been handcuffed when being transferred from prison to hospital. 15 More generally, persons in prison must benefit from extended rights to be well treated, precisely for human dignity's sake. The state must ensure that the conditions in detention are compatible with the respect for human dignity. 16 The case-law is so abundant17 that an authoritative observer of the Court's jurisprudence has written an article, the title of which explains that the Court through its case-law, has effectively added an additional paragraph, 'Article *3 bis',* to the Convention. 18

These are not the only prominent examples of the use of dignity in an Article 3 context. In a case about prostitution, in a strong *obiter dictum,* the Court said that it stated firmly that *forced* prostitution is against human dignity and

against human rights. 19 In a recent case, the Court has held that the Croatian authorities had breached Article 3 for not having protected a physically and mentally disabled person against repeated harassment.20 As can be noticed, many violations found by the Court rely on the failure from the state to fulfil its *positive obligations.* Dignity is therefore an objective to be reached by state authorities, even where private people or organizations encroached upon it.

As regards Article 2 (right to life), there are a very few cases where human dignity is engaged. Nevertheless, at least two where it was engaged, both of them important, should be mentioned. In *Pretty v UK,21* human dignity (especially a right to die with dignity) was invoked by the applicant, a woman suffering from progressive neurodegenerative disease who needed to be assisted by her husband if she was to commit suicide. But the Court, while expressing its strong sympathy towards the applicant, did not find a violation of either Article 2 or Article 3. In the case of *Vo v France,22* the applicant, a pregnant woman, accidentally lost the six-month foetus, a baby girl, whom she was bearing, owing to a medical mistake. The Court recognized that 'the foetus/embryo belongs to the human race ... and requires protection in the name of human dignity' .23 Nevertheless, it held, on legaVprocedural grounds, that there had been no violation of Article 2 in the material case. It may seem paradoxical that human dignity is less present in Article 2 than in Article 3 cases, but such is the fact. The most likely reason is that both the applicants and the Court, *ex officio,* feel less need to invoke, or to have recourse to, human dignity in issues related to respect of life.

Under Article 4, which prohibits slavery, servitude, and forced labour, the small number of applications explains why the Court, at least until recently, has not needed to have recourse to human dignity. In fact, the first judgment concluding that there had been a violation of Article 4 on grounds of servitude, not merely forced labour, in the case of *Siliadin v France,24* concerned a case-of 'domestic slavery', or the so-called 'modem slavery'. Not only did the Court hold that the treatment inflicted on the applicant, a fifteen-year-old girl coming to Paris from Africa, amounted not just to forced labour but to servitude. The Court went further by stating that the exploitation of a person

<sup>19</sup> *Tremblay v France,* 11 September 2007. Actually, the ECtHR, basing itself on the facts of the case, found no violation of Articles 3 or 4 of the Convention, considering that the applicant was not forced to prostitute herself. The judgment is available only in French on the ECtHR's HUDOC site.

in such circumstances was contrary to human dignity.25 This important judgment was confirmed by the Court's judgment in the case of *Rantsev v Cyprus and the Russian Federation,Z6* a very serious case, in which a young woman was forced into human trafficking and transferred from Russia to Cyprus in order to become a prostitute. She eventually died in unclear circumstances. As regards trafficking of human beings, the Court decided that it is covered by Article 4 of the Convention, even if the Convention does not expressly mention it. Article 4 was found to have been violated in this case, and the judgment states that the phenomenon 'threatens the human dignity and the fundamental freedoms of its victims'. 27

# Examples of recourse to human dignity in the case of other Articles

Articles 5 and 6 protect the rights to liberty and security, and to a fair trial. Human dignity, as such, is not used by the Court in finding violations of these provisions, and it is very seldom invoked by the applicants. In the famous case of *John Murray v UK,28* the applicant tried in vain to convince the Court that the fact that adverse inferences were drawn at his trial from his failure to answer questions by the police amounted to a violation of Article 6. The Court's reasoning is that, provided proper safeguards are in place, there is no improper compulsion to self-incrimination. However, in his partly dissenting opinion, Judge Pettiti, joined by Judge Valticos, stated that, for an accused person, the right of choosing to remain or not to remain silent should be free, and that effectively requiring him to answer questions is contrary to human dignity.

Article 7 (no punishment without law), prohibits, in particular, retrospective application of criminal law. Human dignity was engaged in the important cases of S. *W.* and *C.R. v UK,29* where the issue involved the conviction and sentencing of two husbands for the offence of rape committed on their wives. The husbands argued before the British courts, then before the Court in Strasbourg, that the punishment was not foreseeable; the common law, since the seventeenth century, considered that sexual intercourse by a man with his wife against her consent was not illegal. The Court's reasoning, in rejecting the applicants' arguments, is very much founded on human dignity, and equality between man and woman. Both applicants should have foreseen, at the end

of the twentieth century, that the rule had to be changed, in particular with regard to human dignity. 30

In the case of *K.A. and A.D. v Belgium,31* the applicants had been sentenced to penalties of imprisonment and suspended fines, for having committed cruel sadomasochist acts against the first applicant's wife; she had, in principle, consented to these practices, at least to a certain extent. The Court rejected the applicants' complaints, based on Articles 6, 7, and 8 of the Convention. It is striking that neither the defending state, nor even the Court, which could have raised the issue *ex officio,* had recourse to the human dignity argument, which would have been a strong ground for rejecting the application. Many commentators subsequently criticized the judgment for this surprising shortcoming in the reasoning, especially because the Court, while rejecting the case, emphasized the importance of the autonomy of the victim. The difference with the aforementioned *S. W* and *C.R.* should be noted.

Insofar as Article 8 is concerned (right to respect for private and family life), the Court's recourse to the concept of human dignity is recent, but highly relevant. In the so-called 'transsexual' case of *Christine Goodwin and I v UK,* 32 the Court emphasized the fact that 'the very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom' .33 On this basis, the Court found a violation of Article 8 (and Article 12), owing to a refusal by state authorities to grant the applicants, who were post-operative transsexuals, the right to be registered on the registry of births with their new gender, and the right to marry members of their new opposite sex. As is well known, this judgment reversed previous judgments of the Court, 34 showing that its jurisprudence is not necessarily stuck to precedents and may evolve according to new legal and factual elements which occur in Europe (applying the doctrine that the Convention is a 'living instrument', already spelled out in *Tyrer).* The approach in *Christine Goodwin* was followed in a judgment against Lithuania.35

Cmiously, the concept of human dignity was not invoked as such by the applicant in the case of *Chapman v UK,36* a 'Gipsy' case about housing and urban planning, and the denial of a home. Admittedly, the Court recognized that it is highly desirable that every human being has a place to call home in which to live in dignity.37 But, taking into account that many people live

without fixed dwellings, even in 'rich' countries, the Court eventually did not find a violation of Article 8 in the material case. This 'realistic' approach has outweighed considerations in favour of human dignity, despite the sensitivity of the condition of the Roma population.

Article 10 (freedom of speech) applications very seldom involve human dignity arguments. However, the issue was raised in an important judgment dealing with the prosecution of a journalist for not having censored violent statements by racist young people whom he had interviewed for a TV programme.38 The majority of the Court found a violation of Article 10 by the state authorities. However, four dissenters, Judges Ryssdal, Bernhardt (both of them Court Presidents), Alphonse Spielmann and Loizou, expressed their disagreement with the majority's finding, observing that the racist comments of the Greenjackets (as the young people were called) were an attack on, and even a denial of, individuals' human dignity. The dissenters did not consider that the Court's approach was sufficiently protective of the rights of those whose dignity had been attacked, as prescribed by Article 10, §2.

# Why does the Court use the concept of human dignity in some cases more than in others?

Again, the answer is not obvious. The judicial approach of the Court, preceded, as observed, by the Commission, generally appears to use the concept of human dignity to *reinforce* the reasoning leading to a violation of the Convention, while in a few cases dignity is used to reject complaints based on arguments contrary themselves to human dignity (as in the cases of *S. W* and *CR.).* In the latter cases, the Court's reasoning is close to recourse to Article 1 7, which prohibits abuse of rights, and is rarely invoked by the defending states or accepted by the Court. 39

When the Court uses human dignity 'positively', in order to find a violation, it is clear that it applies it much more to serious violations, with Article 3 being especially privileged in this regard among all the provisions of the Convention. The very notion of inhuman and degrading treatment, and even more of torture, is in the Court's view manifestly contrary to human dignity. If dignity is 'inherent to the human person', as stated in the Universal

<sup>38</sup> *Jersild v Denmark,* Grand Chamber judgment of 29 March 1994.

<sup>39</sup> One of the few examples of application of Article 17 is the decision *Garaudy v France,* 24 June 2003. Owing to the prohibited aims (revisionism, in the background of a historical controversy about the *Shoah* ), the Court rejected the claim of the applicant, founded on freedom of expression (Article 1 0).

Declaration and, even more specifically, in the two UN International Covenants, the punishments and treatments prohibited by the Declaration (Article 5) and the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (Article 7), are clearly contrary to human dignity. Under those circumstances, the intention of the judges in Strasbourg becomes less mysterious. They have constantly thought and said that the Convention rights must be interpreted not only on the basis of the text of the Convention itself but also drawing on other international instruments (even if they are not strictly legally binding). The UN's most fundamental instruments are the best possible examples of these external sources of inspiration, and Article 3 of the European Convention is the easiest provision to link with human dignity, in the meaning of the Declaration and the Covenants.

In other words, the reappearance of the concept of human dignity in the Court's jurisprudence expresses a deliberate intention of building a bridge between the universal instruments and the silent European text, filling the gap or the vacuum created by the authors of the Convention. Admittedly, the first example, the Commission's use of dignity in dealing with the issue of racial discrimination, looks even bolder. But is this appearance of boldness really true? Yes and no: the United Nations texts proclaim, after all, that men are *equal* in dignity; racial discrimination breach that equality, and hence dignity itself.

Moreover, it is possible that there are *subjective* reasons, explaining why the judges sitting on the bench were, and perhaps still are, keen on referring to human dignity, even where such references were not indispensable. As regards the Commission's decisions and the Court's judgments dating back to before 1998, at the time of the 'old Court', several members of the Commission, and several judges too, were philosophically or ideologically 'Christian-minded', and some were even politically committed Christian Democrats. This perspective has probably been influential in the first Strasbourg rulings based on dignity, and eventually the case law of the Court had to follow those authorities. This is a personal hypothesis of the author, but one based on some experience, and based on discussions with former members of the Convention institutions.

Admittedly, technically speaking, it is not very clear why in some of the less 'serious' matters, the Court has recourse from time to time to the same concept, and why in other similar matters it does not. There is no clear answer. Probably, the special circumstances of some cases, and the insistence by the applicants on dignity when presenting their arguments to the Court, may explain why there is a selective use of the concept. Again, this is a hypothesis, but ultimately it may not be that important to know. 40

40 The secrecy of deliberations is in any event an obstacle to commenting about recent judgments.

# Is there a link between human dignity and human rights?

Certainly, such a link does exist. Leaving aside the philosophical field, human beings are *legally* entitled to benefit from basic rights because of their inherent dignity, at least according to the most solemn human rights international instruments, including the Universal Declaration and the two international Covenants. But it would be difficult to pretend that *all* human rights are grounded in human dignity, or that a violation of *any* human right constitutes a breach of human dignity. One can argue that some technical violations do not normally conflict with dignity as such, but even then, depending on special circumstances, such technical violations could be contrary to human dignity. For example, the excessive length of proceedings in a domestic trial, leading to a denial of justice and finally to arbitrariness, may become a breach of dignity. 41

This is not, however, the general stance of the ECtHR, at least in its present case law. According to that, only the most fundamental, vital rights are protected by human dignity. That seems reasonable. To infringe dignity, there must be in the acts committed against the victims something especially infamous, outrageous, or disgraceful. This can be logically explained. Historically, the introduction of human dignity in the international texts appeared just after· the atrocities and very serious crimes of the Second World War. By contrast, dignity is absent from the classical domestic human rights declarations, such as the English and American Bills of Rights, and the French *Declaration des droits de l 'homme et du citoyen.* Besides, the_ concept itself would run the risk of becoming devalued, and eventually weakened, by excessive extension of its applications. This is not logical, and above all it is not desirable.

A last question is: is it thinkable that the Court would not refer, or would not have referred, to dignity at all? The answer must be yes, from a strictly legal viewpoint. But reference to human dignity, if it does not necessarily reinforce the legal reasoning, at least emphasizes the *value* of the human being, who is at the centre of a system aimed at protecting human persons against breaches of their fundamental rights. The Court is not merely adjudicating cases: it also has a pedagogical role, and by referring to dignity it thereby sends important signals to all respondent states.

<sup>41</sup> There are a few authorities in that respect. Nevertheless, see *Bock v·Germany,* 29 March 1989: the Court observed in its judgment that during the lengthy period of proceedings, a serious doubt remained about the applicant's mental health, and that there was therefore an encroachment on his human dignity; clearly, this element was an aggravating circumstance; the Court very probably took it into account for assessing the just satisfaction to be granted to the applicant under Article 50, now Article 41, of the Convention.
