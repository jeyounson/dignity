# **Is Dignity Language Useful in Bioethical Discussion of Assisted Suicide and Abortion?**

*David Albert Jones* 

### Dignity talk in bioethics

IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS or so, the term human dignity has come into increasing prominence in bioethical and human rights discourse, in law, and in public policy discussions. However, at the same time as there has been an increase in use of the term, there has also been a reaction against its use (or, at least, against certain current uses of the term). The case against dignity is made in the present volume by Michael Rosen, but he is by no means alone in raising such criticisms. John Harris has attacked the concept of human dignity as 'comprehensively vague', 1 while even defenders have wondered whether it is 'too nebulous to be of use' in bioethics.2 Other critics have suggested that any substantive ethical content expressed in terms of human dignity can be reduced to considerations of autonomy or of well-being, and hence that the term human dignity 'can be eliminated without any loss of content'3 and shoul<!_ be 'purged from bioethical discourse' .4 Michael Rosen concurs with this judgment, suggesting not only that the positive content of dignity language is reducible to the good of liberty but also that this confused and undefined term in fact masks an attack on liberty by reactionary, religious, and/or anti-democratic forces in society.

As many commentators have observed, the term dignity has been used in various senses. 5 Nevertheless, these variations in meaning do not necessarily imply equivocation. There are, rather, 'a family of concepts clustered around the practice of moral evaluation' .6 Indeed, that the search for the essential characteristics of a concept should lead to a family of meanings is not a special feature of the word 'dignity'. It is, rather, a common property of meaning in ordinary language.7

In relation to bioethics and human rights, the concept of dignity is commonly invoked in at least two distinct ways.

In the first place it provides a basis for human rights in respect for other persons as persons. This is how the term is used in preambles to declarations of human rights or fundamental constitutions. Used in this way it does not serve to identify a particular aspect of the human good that is to be protected. It rather serves as a placeholder for the recognition of other personffas worthy of moral consideration, as making moral claims on us. This use is sometimes signalled by the terms 'inherent dignity' 8 or 'intrinsic dignity' .9

It is well known that those who drew up the Universal Declaration on Human Rights did not in fact agree on the character of this fundamental basis. 10 This lack of agreement is potentially a serious problem for use of dignity language, because how we understand human dignity will influence the way we understand those rights that are founded 11pon it. Nevertheless, any set of moral categories will involve analogous problems. For exampl!!, Jeremy Bentham notoriously dismissed human rights' talk as 'nonsense upon stilts', 11 while others have seen Bentham's own project of a consistent calculus of pain

and pleasure as both 'utterly impractical' and open to 'all manner of objections' as the basis for moral judgment.12

Furthermore, the attempt to eliminate any idea of intrinsic dignity reduces ethics to a system of procedural reasoning (based on rational consistency) or utilitarian reasoning (based on pleasures or preferences) or to some combination of the two. These forms of reasoning inadmissible the claim that some actions or goals are worthwhile or honourable in themselves *(honestum),* but insist instead that every human good must be related to the useful *(utile)* or the pleasant ( *delectatio* ). 13 However, consistency in action is not sufficient to ground ethical reasoning. A cynical view of human nature may be consistent in expecting no respect from others and giving no respect to others. A Hobbesian view of human nature as a 'war of all, against all' 14 is consistent, but it excludes what is most worthy in human nature. Furthermore, it is not at all obviou.s why we should respect people's choices per se, if these choices are based merely on pleasure or arbitrary preference instead of anything worthwhile. The strongest modern defender of the value of autonomy was Immanuel Kant, but he was far from seeing every whim and desire as an exercise of autonomous choice.

The second use of the term dignity is not as a fundamental basis for morality but as a specific term to pick out certain human goods, and in particular the goods of honour or public acknowledgement. It is this second kind of use, sometimes termed 'attributed dignity', 15 that explains the use of dignity in relation to some issues more than to others. In its general (intrinsic) sense *every* act of injustice is a failure to respect or honour the injured person: a failure 'to acknowledge his or her dignity. On the other hand, some kinds of injustice, such as forcing someone to live or work in subhuman conditions, seem to contradict human dignity in a more specific way. This second attributed meaning is easier to grasp in transgression than in fulfilment. It is the good tliat is harmed by humiliation, by degradation, or by demeaning actions or social structures.

### Dignity as an analogical concept

With the exception of very narrow technical terms, any word that is remotely interesting will be used in more than one context and with more than one

sense: it will express a 'family of meanings'. Its use in different contexts is not equivocal nor is it simply metaphorical but it is what Thomas Aquinas called 'analogical'. The different senses of a word are related by analogy.

Analogical terms often have a central or fundamental meaning in relation to which other meanings are best understood. Thus, for example, 'healthy food' and a 'healthy complexion' are secondary to the health of the body. The central concept here is bodily health, and other meanings are related as causes of or signs of that health. It seems unarguable that the most tal meaning of human dignity is inherent or intrinsic dignity-the dignity we have on the basis of our shared humanity. 16 Nevertheless, Thomas Aquinas pointed out that the context in which we first learn a word does not ily provide its most fundamental meaning. 17 What is first in order of learning is not necessarily first in order oflogic. This general truth is also applicable to the word 'dignity', and one may well agree with Waldron18 that it is the second attributed sense, dignity as public status or acknowledgement, whichwas the first to appear historically, 19 and yet think that over time we have come to discover a more fundamental meaning.

The remainder of the chapter is concerned primarily with dignity in this secondary attributed sense in the context of debates over assisted suicide and abortion. This attributed use is not wholly separable from the more fundamental concept of intrinsic dignity. On the contrary, there must be some relation between dignity as public status and dignity as intrinsic. However, it may be that the more fundamental concept is more difficult to grasp, and thus a discussion of dignity in the practical context ofbioethical debates over· assisted suicide and abortion will both help illuminate those debates and also be a profitable entry into deeper philosophical reflection on intrinsic dignit)r.

### Dignity, indignity, and assisted suicide

Dignity language is used on both sides of the assisted suicide and abortion debates. In relation to assisted suicide, the debate may be characterized as between those who favour the practice, understanding it to be the acknowledgement of human dignity ('dignity as liberty'), and those who oppose it,

holding it to be a failure to acknowledge human dignity ('dignity as life'). Inasmuch as this is so, it may be thought that talk of dignity adds ljttle to the debate not already provided by the moral principles of autonomy and respect for human life.

What is striking, however, is the prevalence of dignity language in this debate. This is evident in the name of the Swiss suicide organization Dignitas and in the name of the largest and oldest organization in the United Kingdom campaigning for the legalization of assisted suicide and euthanasia. This was founded in 1934 as the Voluntary Euthanasia Legalization Society. Aside from a brief period in which it was called Exit, this title was retained with minor variations (with or without 'voluntary', with or without 'legislation') until2005, when it was renamed Dignity in Dying. The change of name avoids the stigma attached to the word euthanasia; it also represents a shift from concern about pain relief to concern about the dignity of choice and the indignity of disability and dependence. A similar pattern is seen in the name given to Oregon's Death with Dignity Act/0 and in the names of other lobby organizations and books that favour legalizing assisted suicide. Thus, studies of terminally ill patients who request euthanasia show that the request is associated, among other things, with *fear of indignity,* loss of control, and cognitive impairment.21 While the concept of dignity is invoked in favour of legalizing euthanasia and/or assisted suicide, it has also been invoked against such proposals. One common line of argument is that assisting suicide contradicts human dignity because it fails to respect the dignity of each human life. This has been termed 'dignity as life', but it would be a mistake to reduce it to concern for the dignity of so-called 'biological life' alone. It is, rather, an appeal to the fundamental sense of intrinsic dignity that is held to be the basis of equality and of all other rights. On this view, killing is not wrong only when it frustrates someone's previous desires (including the explicit or impltcit desire to continue to live). Rather, killing contradicts the intrinsic dignity of human existence in all its aspects: both life itself and what life makes possible for the person and for other people. If one follows Kant, this

will also be true of self-killing.22 Understood in this way, suicide is seen not so much as a failure of courage23 or a failure of obedience to God24 or a failure of self-love25 (though it may be seen as these things as well), but, more fundamentally, as a failure to respect the worth or dignity of humanity in one's own case. Since the 1960s, in many jurisdictions, attempting suicide has been dealt with by mental health care rather than by criminal sanction, but assisting suicide remains a serious offence because of the dignity of each life, even when that dignity is not recognized by the victim.

The claim that suicide, and assisting suicide, contradict intrinsic human dignity has been a popular argument among bioethicists and jurists, especially in contexts where a Kantian conception of dignity is found persuasive.26 However, because this concept of intrinsic dignity is categorically different from the attributed dignity that touches upon issues of dependence and loss of control, it is difficult to resolve this argument without appropriate definitions of dignity. A systematic account of dignity may well favour resolution in the direction of intrinsic dignity,27 but whereas there is agreement that there are many uses of the term dignity, there is no consensus as to how these uses are to be understood in relation to one another.

At a political level, those who invoke these two uses of dignity therefore tend to talk past one another. There is, however, a possibility for more direct engagement between protagonists of different views if one focuses on the attributed use of dignity. Those who invoke dignity in favour of assisted suicide typically characterize a life of dependence and disability as undignified: if the person in this state does not have access to assistance in suicide, then he or she is forced to endure the indignity of what is considered a subhuman condition oflife. The emotional appeal to dignity-language by the proponents of assisted suicide is thus not only concerned with the dignity of autonomous choice, it is implicitly or explicitly framed as a choice that allows the person to escape a state of indignity. This is clear from the limitation almost universally placed on such proposals, that they should apply only to the choice to

This is not to endorse Kant's account of human dignity more generally, only to acknowledge his perceptiveness in seeing that suicide is a failure to respect the worth or dignity of human life in one's own case.

die of those suffering from terminal and/or disabling conditions. They are not intended for the inconsolable jilted lover or the shamed public servant. They are not intended to cover all and every suicide attempt but specifically concern those where the condition oflife is implicitly agreed to be intolerable. However, once this rationale is made explicit, it has clear implications for the *dignity of equality* of others who live with disability. If different rules apply to those who are dependent and disabled and to those who are healthy, then the law is failing to grant equal status to disabled citizens and those with a short life expectancy. In practical and political terms, the desire for euthanasia is inseparable from the fear of dependence and of loss of control, of incontinence and of dementia, in short, from the fear of disability. While this desire is expressed as a wish to 'die with dignity', it implies that living in certain conditions is, per se, an indignity. This implication has been recognised by the disability rights movement, which is why, along with physicians, it is groups who represent disabled people who have been among the most vocal in their opposition to legalizing euthanasia or assisted suicide.28

The use of dignity language in the debate over assisted suicide thus expresses ethical concerns that are irreducible to the issues of autonomy and public safety. The concept of dignity both adds conceptually to the debate and explains the emotional force of the appeal of, and of the opposition to, assisted suicide. A key question at issue is: what can be regarded as a dignified death? And concomitantly, what can be regarded as a dignified life? Nor from the fact that dignity is invoked on both sides of the debate does it follow that 'the concept of human dignity is an unsuitable tool for settling normative questions pertaining to end-of-life decision making' .29 Rather, the appeal to dignity in opposition to assisted suicide both appeals to a more fundamental meaning of dignity (that of intrinsic dignity) and effectively answers the appeal to attributed dignity on its own terms. Opposition to assisted suicide is importantly motivated by the concern that the very act of judging life with impairment as a 'life unworthy to be lived' is discriminatory and humiliating towards those who live with impairment. It is, precisely, *a failure to respect human life with impairment,* and hence a failure not just of' dignity as life' but of 'dignity as equality'.

# The elision of assisted suicide and abortion

There is some similarity between debates surrounding assisted suicide and abortion, and these issues are sometimes elided for a variety of philosophical, cultural, or other reasons. However, such elision is often more confusing than enlightening.

It is true that the issues emerge from the same historical and political context. It is a remarkable coincidence that the Voluntary Euthanasia Society and the Abortion Law Reform Association were founded in England within months of each other (VELS in December 193530, ALRA in February 193631), and there have been prominent advocates who have defended both causes. For example, Glanville Williams, former Professor of Law and Cambridge University, served at different times both as vice-president ofthe Voluntary Euthanasia (Legislation) Society and as president of the Abortion Law Reform Association. In 1957, before either practice had been decriminalized, he advocated the legalizing of both (and also infanticide, suicide, and assisted suicide) in his influential work *The Sanctity of Life and the Criminal Law.32* 

Those who advocate for both abortion and euthanasia frequently frame these as related issues of personal choice or liberty, a theme that has sometimes been developed into a sustained argument.33 As advocates of euthanasia and abortion frequently link the two issues, so opponents also link these issues. Thus, for example, Pope John Paul II, in his encyclical on the value and inviolability of human life, *Evangelium Vitae,* argues that the pro life ment has emerged as a counter movement both to the legalization of abortion and to attempts to legalize euthanasia: 'In view oflaws which permit abortion and in view of efforts, which here and there have been successful, to legalize euthanasia, *movements and initiatives to raise social awareness iri defence of life* have sprung up in many parts of the world'.34 John Paul II, in common with Glanville Williams and Ronald Dworkin, accepts the link between these two issues but, rather than seeing them as essentially matters of choice, understands them as attacks on the inviolability of human life.

There are, therefore, aspects that link abortion and euthanasia (and assisted suicide), conceptually and historically. Nevertheless, it is equally important to note important distinctions between these two issues. Whereas both movements had their origin in the 1930s and they have shared some common proponents, some common opponents, some common arguments in favour, and some common arguments against, the movements have fared very differently. As of2007, according to the UN, over 78 per cent of countries including over 61 per cent of the world population lived under laws that allowed abortion for social and economic reasons.35 In contrast, in the same year, only two countries (The Netherlands and Belgium) had decriminalized euthanasia (and assisted suicide), and one country (Switzerland) and two states of the USA had legalized assisted suicide-representing in total less than 2 per cent of countries and less than 0.5 per cent of the world population. For whatever reason, most countries have liberalized abortion law and most countries have not liberalized laws on euthanasia or assisted suicide.

The two movements are also distinct politically. The movement to promote access to legal abortion has from the first been strongly associated with feminism. This is not to say that abortion advocacy represents all women, or even all feminists, but in political terms the core of the movement is women's groups. In contrast, euthanasia is not and historically has not been a core feminist issue, and many feminists have been cautious about changes in the law in this area. 36

The two issues are also quite distinct in relation to disability. As outlined above, a change in the law on assisted suicide is opposed by many disability groups who object to the double standard implicit in proposed legislationthat there is a duty to prevent suicide attempts by healthy and able-bodied citizens, while requests from those with disabilities or severe ill-health will not be resisted but actively facilitated. In contrast, while it is also true that many-in the disability rights movement object to abortion for reason of disability, these objections do not typically amount to opposition to legal access to abortion as such.

Assisted suicide and abortion can be framed as an argument as to whether choice can excuse or justify the taking of life, but both the choice in question and the life in question are somewhat different. The controversy over assisted suicide concerns the choice of someone to take his or her own life and the choice of a second person to facilitate this. The controversy over abortion

concerns whether the choice of a woman can justify a second person to facilitate or assist in taking a life whose status is disputed (the foetus or unborn child) and who depends for survival on remaining in her body. The context and implications of these issues are distinct, and so it is possible for someone to be opposed to legalizing assisted suicide but in favour of legal access to abortion,37 or indeed to be in favour oflegalizing assisted suicide but opposed to unrestricted access to abortion. 38 More subtly, for someone who is opposed to both or who is in favour of both, it is important to recognize that these are nevertheless distinct issues which should be considered separately.

# Dignity in the abortion debate

While the abortion debate is distinct from the debate over assisted suicide and euthanasia, dignity language has nevertheless also played a role in legal and ethical discussion of abortion. Here again the debate has sometimes been framed as a conflict between 'dignity as liberty' and 'dignity as life'. The appeal to dignity as liberty evokes the idea qf enforced labour or servitude, in this case the idea of *enforced pregnancy.* However, the issue is very different from assisted suicide in that the solution in the case of abortion involves the destruction not of one's own life but ofthat of an 'other'. At the heart ofthe debates between individuals and nations over the ethics of abortion is the question of whether the unborn life is or is not to be regarded as possessing the dignity of a person (in the sense of an individual with full moral status). This· question concerns the foundational sense of dignity-the question of whether the human,embryo or foetus is an 'other' possessing inherent or intrinsic dignity and thus meriting legal protection.

The abortion debate, therefore, far more than the euthanasia debate, involves the question of who is to be counted as a person with rights. If this

fundamental question is not resolved, then it is questionable how far the concept of dignity can bridge the gap.

One example of the use of dignity-language in support of a consensus position on abortion is described by Reva SiegeP9 She has argued that, in a number of jurisdictions, consideration of the dignity of women has been used to shape the way that the state seeks to protect unborn lives. In states that recognize a duty on the state to protect the unborn child, an increasing number have moved to protect the child not through threat of prosecution but through provision of counselling. This move has sometimes been defended on the basis of efficacy: counselling has been presented as more effective a means of protecting the child (and its mother) from abortion. However, in addition to such pragmatic arguments, governments have sometimes also argued that it is more in keeping with the dignity of women to protect unborn life by persuasion and counselling rather than by the threat of legal sanction. In this way, appeal to dignity is regarded as the basis of a possible compromise position which grants legal status to the unborn while permitting legal access to termination of pregnancy.

Siegel has provided a useful example of the way dignity is sometimes seen as forming the basis of a practical consensus between positions which have hitherto been irreconcilable. However, the extent and sustainability of this purported consensus is very much open to question. While advocates of access to legal abortion will generally welcome statutory counselling when this supplants a total ban on abortion, the same advocates fight fiercely against statutory counselling in contexts such as the USA and the UK, where abortion is legally available. Similarly, opponents of abortion, where they seek statutory (as opposed to non-statutory) counselling, only seek it as a means to discourage abortion when a thoroughgoing ban is politically or legally unachievable. Thus, for advocates on both sides of the debate, statutory counselling is seen as a potentially acceptable middle position only en route to more consistent-position (either more consistent liberty of action or more consistent protection of the unborn).

These political considerations are confirmed by philosophical reflection. Peter Singer, an advocate of unrestricted access to abortion, has argued convincingly that unrestricted access to abortion is philosophically defensible only on the basis that the unborn child is not a person. Appeals to privacy, as for example in the *Roe v Wade* decision, 'take for granted that abortion does not harm an "other"-which is precisely the point that needs to be proven

39 R. B. Siegel, 'Dignity and the politics of protection: abortion restrictions under Casey/Carhart', *Faculty Scholarship Series,* Paper 1134 (2008), and Siegel, Chapter 30, this volume.

before we can legitimately apply the principle in the case of abortion' .40 The importance of the status of the child is evident if one considers the related issue of infanticide. The English law, and that of several other jurisdictions; includes a statute on infanticide,41 which allows offenders to avoid a charge of murder if they admit to infanticide. This provision recognizes the disturbed state of mind typically found in women who kill their own children. However, in the case of infanticide this mitigation does not serve completely to exonerate the act, and it offers no mitigation whatsoever to the guilt of professionals or others who may have failed to prevent these acts, let alone those who have facilitated them. It seems therefore that appeals to dignity as liberty as the basis for complete decriminalization of abortion mask an unacknowledged rejection of the equal human status of the unborn human life. If that status is acknowledged, then it will justify significant restrictions of liberty, for there can be no general legal or ethical liberty to kill an innocent 'other'.

# Dignity and the instrumentalization of human embryos

Another way in which dignity is used in the search for new agreement in public policy debates at the beginning of life is by arguing that the dignity of human nature should be respected even if the embryo is not yet recognized as a person in the full sense. Human dignity is potentially a broader than human personhood. This is particularly evident in the debate over the use of human embryos in experimentation. A number of philosophers and jurists have objected to the instrumentalization (and, still more, to the commercialization) of human embryos without thereby committing themselves to acknowledging the human embryo as a person.42 Respect for the dignity of human nature from its origin has helped secure agreement within Europe on the prohibition of creating embryos for research and of patenting technologies that rely on the destruction of human embryos, as evident in the Convention

Thomson and others that free access to abortion would be justifiable even if, for the sake of argument, it were granted that the unborn child had the dignity and status of a person.

on Human Rights and Biomedicine43 and the Briistle decision.44 Such reasons have also been invoked as the basis for international agreement on a ban on reproductive cloning and on germline genetic engineering.

The invocation of the dignity of human nature has secured a consensus within Europe that includes more than those who regard the human embryo as having the moral status of a person. Nevertheless, this line of argument is more convincing against a Kantian (or Heideggerian) background or within a natural law context or within a religious context. In a reductive Englishspeaking context, the appeal to human nature loses its objective weight and is easily regarded as symbolic, that is, as expressive merely of subjective feelings of offence.45 It has seemed opaque to many English-speaking commentators and has been viewed with some suspicion by feminist critics,46 even those who are cautious about new biotechnologiesY Furthermore, in the face of the perceived p:t;Omise of biomedical benefits, this argument has inhibited but has not prevented use of embryonic stem celllines.48 Indeed, it is arguably this· appeal to human dignity by bioethicists such as Leon Kass49 in the context of the debate in the USA over embryonic stem cell research and therapeutic cloning that has led to the concept of human dignity being strongly contested. Far from being a mechanism for securing consensus and side-stepping the question of the status of the embryo, it has generated further controversy focusing precisely on this disputed status.

### Conclusion

In sum, considering human dignity adds significantly to an understanding of the debate of assisted suicide. It both helps disclose the emotional attraction of assisted suicide and helps disclose an ethical problem with assisted suicide that runs deeper than the reiterated arguments about slippery slopes and non-voluntary euthanasia. On the other hand, the recognition of the dignity of women and the recognition of the dignity of human nature are of more limited value in controversies surrounding abortion and the embryo research debate. They may help gamer support for policies such as statutory counselling for abortion, and they may provide a rationale for maintaining the ban on instrumental uses of human embryos. However, until there is agreement over the central question of the status of the disputed 'other', the justice of such policies cannot adequately be determined and thus deeper disagreement will, and indeed should, remain.
