# **The Vanishing Absolute and the Deconsecrated God: A Theological Reflection on Revelation, Law, and Human Dignity**

#### *Tina Beattie*

THE THEME OF Tms BOOK raises a crucial question which is addressed in several chapters, including the session to which my own chapter refers. What do we mean when we use words such as 'human' and 'dignity', and what relationship do those words have to one another in the quest for justice? These are historically contingent words which shift in meaning depending on their contexts, and our concepts of justice shift with them.

This chapter is developed from my response to papers delivered at the original conference by Costas Douzinas, David Gushee, and Dieter Grimm (Gushee's and Grimm's revised versions are included in this book, 1 and Douzinas's approach was based on a previously published book),2 positioned within my own disciplinary perspective of theology. I weave together strands from different theoretical and philosophical arguments to create a loosely woven theological tapestry-incomplete and full of gaps as every theological reftection must be, if it is to avoid the hubristic violation of the mystery before which it positions itself. This mystery is not only the mystery of the divine but also, and perhaps more importantly, the mystery ofthe human, that imaginative ape which suffers yearning and sorrow because somewhere along the evolutionary process its soul jumped the tracks of the finite and it began to imagine and to fear the prospect of its own death: 'In the day that you eat thereofyou shall surely die', God cautioned the innocents in Eden, warning

them against eating the deadly fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (Gen. 2:17).3

The theme of original sin is not popular today, even although its evidence is all around us. Like that other old warning that you cannot serve both God and Mammon (Matt. 6:24), liberal optimists flourish best when they ignore these uncomfortable biblical cautions. However, I want to suggest that much postmodern theory is implicitly informed by a pessimistic view of the human condition, which could be seen as the secular derivative of the doctrine of original sin. Whatever we call it, this is the apprehension that our lives are haunted by a perpetual sense of alienation and suffering, and that all our institutions and relationships bear the taint of violence in some form or another. I ask what the Christian dialectic of sin and grace can contribute to our understanding of this a:ffiiction of our species, in a way that might open up a precipitous path of justice between the nihilism of some postmodern theorists, and the complacency of their more optimistic liberal counterparts.

It is with this in mind that I begin with a discussion of Douzinas's postmodern critique of the concept ofhuman dignity and its Christian influences, which I explore in the context of Giorgio Agamben's idea of *homo sacer.4* I then consider Gushee's quite different interpretation of the significance of the biblical understanding of the human as sacred, and I relate this to the natural law tradition. This brings me to a critical evaluation of human dignity as an absolute right enshrined in the German Basic Law, which is the topic of Grimm's chapter. Finally, I weave all these themes into a short theological reflection on Christ as *homo sacer.* 

# Universal humanity and *homo sacer*

Douzinas focused on the problematic claims of human rights and the concept of the human that informs them. He argued that Christianity's universalization of the term 'human' has lent legitimacy to the West's missionizing and colonizing violence, up to and including the imposition of secular concepts of universal human rights by various forms of political, military, and economic coercion. The concept of universal humanity elides difference, sets up one norm (that of the Western Christian tradition and its secular derivatives) as the

standard for all others, and widens the gap between normative and empirical humanity.

Douzinas invites comparison between his critique of human rights and Agamben's idea of *homo sacer.5* This is an enigmatic concept in ancient Roman law, in which the Latin *sacer* has a more ambivalent meaning than the word 'sacred'. It means 'set apart', and it refers both to those who are exempt from the law because they are over and above it (the sovereign as lawgiver outside the law),6 and to those who are excluded from the law because they are beneath it. Paradoxically, both of these positions are also defined within the law, insofar as it is the law itself that authorizes the exception enacted in its name.

Agamben applies the term *'homo sacer'* to the one who is excluded by law from the benefits, protections, and rights of modem liberal society, so that he or she exists in a condition of 'bare life'. In Greek philosophical terms this constitutes the biological organism whose life *(zoe)* has not yet become the particular form of life *(bios)* constituted by incorporation into the social body (the *polis).* In the ancient world, such life could not be sacrificed (the divinized sovereign above the law cannot be sacrificed under the law, and the bare life beneath the law lacks the significance to be a worthy sacrifice), but it could be destroyed with impunity.

For Agamben, this figure of *homo sacer* as the exception outside the law produced by the law is the originary embodiment of Western political relationships. In modernity, it acquires deadly significance because of the fusion of 'bare life' and politics.7 There is no longer any distinction between organic life and political life, so that our bodies become colonized by the political order through the modem idea of autonomy. This gives me sovereignty over myself, but I always risk being reduced to 'bare life' if that self-sovereignty should be taken from me by mental or physical incapacity, or by political legal-intervention:

> It is as if every valorization and every 'politicization' of life (which, after all, is implicit in the sovereignty of the individual over his own existence) necessarily implies a new decision concerning the threshold beyond which life ceases to be politically relevant, becomes only 'sacred life', and can as such be eliminated without punishment. Every society sets this limit; every society-even the most modem--decides who its 'sacred men' will be. It is

<sup>5</sup> See Douzinas, *Human Rights and Empire.* 

<sup>6</sup> Agamben develops this idea in engagement with the work of Carl Schmitt. See Carl Schmitt, *Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty,* trans. George Schwab (Cambridge, MA, MIT Press, 1985).

<sup>7</sup> These arguments can also be approached from a Foucaultian perspective. Compare with Stephen Morton and Stephen Bygrave (eds), *Foucault* in *an Age of Terror: Essays on Biopolitics and the Defence of Society* (Basingstoke and New York, Palgrave Macmillan, 2008).

even possible that this limit, on which the politicization and the *exception* of natural life in the juridical order of the state depends, has done nothing but extend itself in the history of the West and has now-in the new biopolitical horizon of states with national sovereignty-moved inside every human life and every citizen. Bare life is no longer confined to a particular place or a definite category. It now dwells in the biological body of every living being.8

The fusion between biological life and politics eliminates the space of ambiguity between *zoe* and *bios* within which a living body might experience a limited freedom, before or beyond its inscription within the law. In terms of our humanity, we are now all or nothing-fully human or not human at alland there is no protection for any form of in-between organic human life that is not politically constituted and legally sanctioned. For Agamben, the Nazi death camps are the defining example of the biopolitics of modernity-he calls them 'the *"Nomos"* of the modem' 9-but he also discusses the American response to 9/11 and Guantanamo Bay in similar terms. 10

Douzinas's critique of the concept of universal humanity refers to the normative human inscribed within the proliferating complexity of the concept of human rights, as every possible activity becomes incorporated and legislated for or against within the language of rights. The universal human encapsulated within the concept of human rights is life as *bios-the* biopolitically constructed and codified citizen who conforms to the conventions and laws of society, and who is bodily mapped and trapped within the rights that accrue to the modem subject by virtue of being designated and legally recognized as 'human'.

What Douzinas refered to as 'empirical humanity' 11 could be described as bare life or *zoe.* It is life as it is experienced on the margins of the normative or the sphere of the law. Such life offers a certain freedom from the rules, but it is always at risk of being violated, eliminated, or ignored in .order to eradicate every exception that would threaten the universal norm. A human body that is not ensnared within the bureaucracy of laws, rights, policies, surveillance, and accountability enjoys what might seem to many of us a lavish freedom, but that body enjoys such freedom only on condition that it also forfeits its right to protection. Human life has value if and only if it conforms to the rules.

Yet there are two problems with Douzinas's account of history and the human condition. First, in his damning evaluation of the Western Christian

legacy, Douzinas himself falls into the trap of eliding all that is particular, empirical, and diverse by way of a universalizing hypothesis that fabricates and then condemns a normative metanarrative of Christian history and its concept of the human. He elides the robust particularity and revolutionary spirit, which have been as much a part of the Christian story as imperial conquest and tyranny. Christianity takes many forms-it tells many stories, inspires many dreams, awakens many desires, and weaves together friends and strangers across boundaries of time and place in multiple and diverse configurations of culture, faith, and practice. These complex and prismatic realities disappear before the cold glare of scientific rationalism, they are flattened out and rendered anachronistic by the universalising claims of human rights; but they also dematerialize before the deconstructive gaze of the postmodem sceptic.

The second problem is with Douzinas's deferred utopianism, and with his advocacy of the revolutionary potential of the Freudian death drive, which is pacified by the securities and happiness promised (but never delivered) by universal human rights. The death drive enables us to go to the revolutionary frontiers of the secure, the familiar, and the defended in order to expose ourselves to the vulnerability of encounter, risk, and transformation. It is the opposite of the pleasure principle, which orientates us towards stasis, comfort, and complacency. But the death drive is also capable of arousing sadomasochistic impulses, which are the dark underbelly of the politics of revolution and anarchy. As philosopher John Gray argues, the utopian revolutions and progressive ideologies of modernity have tended to disintegrate into savage and sometimes genocidal regimes. 12 In Louis Walcher's critique of the relationship between law and violence, he argues persuasively that humanity is universal only in its capacity to suffer. 13 The attempted elimination of suffering can thus be seen as a horror coiled within every utopian quest, because it is only possible to eliminate suffering if we eliminate the humans who suffer or who are deemed to cause others to suffer, and thus there is no end to the killing that can be justified in the pursuit of utopia.

So my appeal to Douzinas is to practise more thoroughly what he preaches, to let go of the need to find a universalizing historical metanarrative which only perpetuates the suffering and exclusion that it seeks to address. The myth of progress still lurks within such postmodem deconstructive strategies, for

Welcher engages with Douzinas in Louis E. Welcher, 'The problem of the subject(s)', in Anne Wagner and Jan M. Broekman ( eds), *Prospects of Legal Semiotics* (London and New York, Springer Dordrecht Heidelberg, 201 0), 145-70.

they share with modernity the belief that only the future can be redeemed, only the future can be struggled towards. The past is what hinders and oppresses us, and we must shake off its claims upon us as we surge towards the brave new world of nihilistic postmodem utopianism, even if this is infinitely deferred.

To say this is not to deny that the ideology of neo-liberalism demands resistance and transformation, but it is to insist that the fragile hopes of the future cannot be articulated without also attending to the fragile memories and untold stories of the past which are discovered within religious traditions. Johann Baptist Metz, a German theologian writing out of the context of the Holocaust, speaks of the 'dangerous memories' which interrupt progressive accounts of history by calling attention to the silenced voices and unheeded cries of suffering that constitute the human story. 14 The 'dangerous memory' of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection calls Christians to attend to the voices of the victims of history, and it exposes the culpability of all who, claiming to be Christian, have ignored or encouraged the suffering inflicted in their name. However, many of those silenced and forgotten voices are themselves anonymous Christian saints and martyrs--only the few are named and remembered-and the wholesale condemnation of Christianity by postmodem thinkers such as Douzinas perpetuates this act of silencing.

### The human as sacred

Let me tum now to Gushee's quite different evaluation of the Christian legacy. Gushee argues that dignity is too thin a concept when compared with the rich meaning of human sacredness inherent in the biblical tradition. While acknowledging the abuses that have been part of Christian history, he nevertheless argues that the Bible offers a paradigmatic account of the sacredness of the human which sanctifies each and every human, guaranteed by God as 'the ultimate source of law in Israel', in the context of an essentially egalitarian understanding of divine law. Modem Western culture has squandered this rich biblical legacy through its compromises with power, violence, and injustice. The idea of sacredness has been replaced by the relatively thin secularized concept of human dignity, grounded in reason not in revelation, and it was discarded altogether by Nietzsche and his followers.

<sup>14</sup> See Johann Baptist Metz, *Faith in History and Society: Toward a Practical Fundamental Theology,*  trans. David Smith (New York, Seabury, 1980).

So there is a hermeneutical conflict in the versions of Western religious history and its influences offered by Douzinas and Gushee. For Douzinas, Christianity is part of the problem; for Gushee it is part of the solution. For Douzinas, Hegelian, Marxist, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives offer an indispensable vantage point from which to criticize liberal legal and political philosophy. For Gushee, Nietzschean nihilism is symptomatic of the failure of post-Christian societies. The task of Christian intellectuals is to retrieve the richness of the biblical understanding of human sacredness as a resource for a deeper ethos than human dignity.

However, Gushee risks minimizing the failure of historical Christianity to make good on its claims of justice and equality. No other religion-including Islam-has been used to justify violence, conquest, and inequality quite so effectively as Christianity. IfDouzinas needs to be more attentive to the redemptive vision of peace empirically realized in individual Christian lives, Gushee needs to be more attentive to the ways in which these redemptive fragments cannot be pieced together to form a coherent picture of Christian justice. They remain what they are-neglected memories that shimmer amid the rubble of the past, so that only through the careful sifting of historical despair are we able to extract the nuggets of hope. 'Bare life'-the life chosen by Christians who willingly transgress in order to express solidarity with Christ in the poor, the marginalized, and the criminalized-cannot be institutionalized or legitimated, for then it ceases to be 'bare life' at all. It must remain the exception if it is to challenge the system.

Before I tum to consider the idea of human dignity as an absolute in the context of Grimm's chapter, I want to bring a theological perspective to bear on the foregoing. What follows is necessarily underdeveloped, but I hope it gives a sense of what theology might bring to this discussion so far.

#### *Amor mundi* and *contemptus mundi*

There is a tension in Christianity between two broad traditions which flow in and out of one another in various configurations and forms of political, ethical, and theological expression. *A mar mundi,* love of the world, seeks an ephemeral flourishing within the material conditions of earthly life in recognition that creation is good and loved by God. *Contemptus mundi,* contempt for the world, seeks detachment and transcendence in relation to a natural order that is mired in sin and enslaved by violence. At the risk of extreme oversimplification, and with many exceptions on both sides, Catholic theology has tended towards the former and Protestant theology towards the latter. The tradition that emphasizes the destructive effects of original sin on the human capacity for natural justice is often-and not entirely accurately-associated with Augustine who, writing in the fifth century during the collapse of the Roman Empire, viewed the earthly city as a symbol of violence and oppression, blighted by sin and incapable of offering its inhabitants the justice and peace of the City of God. 15 In some Protestant theologies, this Augustinian pessimism evolves into a sweeping indictment of all attempts to discern justice and goodness within the natural order of a graced creation. Grace comes only through faith in Jesus Christ as revealed in the Bible, and this is the only hope of human salvation. Postmodern pessimism can be understood as the distant heir to Augustinianism and the theologies of the Reformation, although shorn of their themes of judgment and redemption.

Gushee's fundamentally positive evaluation of the biblical tradition in relation to the social order invites comparison with the Catholic understanding of natural law associated with Thomas Aquinas and scholasticism. The natural law tradition posits a fundamental continuity between grace and nature, reason and revelation, so that the relationship between theological and philosophical approaches to knowledge is complementary rather than contradictory. It is predicated upon a vision of cosmic justice which filters through all the levels of the created order, which manifests itself to human understanding through the use of reason and conscience, and which makes it possible' for human authorities to enshrine just laws within their societies and institutions in a way that maintains the social conditions necessary for the good of each and the good of all. The idea of natural law has played a central role in the formation of Catholic concepts of justice, law, and ethics because of the belief that all nature,. including human nature, participates in the divine law, and original sin has damaged but not destroyed our natural capacity for justice. To give a brief example of this, I want to refer to the Vatican II document on religious liberty, *Dignitatis Humanae. 16* 

This is a revolutionary document in the Catholic theological tradition, because for the first time it not only recognizes but also defends the right to religious freedom, and it does so in the context of human dignity. It starts by acknowledging that a sense of human dignity is becoming an increasingly important aspect of modern consciousness, and it cites the right to religious freedom as a primary concern in this context. Human dignity derives from

<sup>15</sup> See Augustine, *Concerning the City of God against the Pagans,* trans. Henry Bettenson (London and New York, Penguin Books, 2003).

<sup>16</sup> Pope Paul VI, *'Dignitatis Humanae:* On the Right of the Person and of Communities to Social and Civil Freedom in Matters Religious', 7 December 1965, http://www.vatican.va/archivelhist_councils/ ii_ vatican_ council/documents/vat-ii_ decl_l9651207 _ dignitatis-humanae _ en.html.

the fact that we are 'beings endowed with reason and free will and therefore privileged to bear personal responsibility' (#2). This entails an obligation to seek the truth, and this in turn requires 'immunity from external coercion as well as psychological freedom' (#2). The document defends the primacy of conscience and the freedom from coercion and force which this demands.

*Dignitatis Humanae* begins with an appeal to natural law, before focusing more closely on how this is to be understood in terms of biblical revelation. It affirms that:

> the highest norm of human life is the divine law--eternal, objective and universal-whereby God orders, directs and governs the entire universe and all the ways of the human community by a plan conceived in wisdom and love. Man has been made by God to participate in this law, with the result that, under the gentle disposition of divine Providence, he can come to perceive ever more fully the truth that is unchanging. (#3)

After setting out this inclusive vision informed by natural law, the document moves on to bring a particular theological slant to its understanding of the human condition:

> God calls men to serve Him in spirit and in truth, hence they are bound in conscience but they stand under no compulsion. God has regard for the dignity of the human person whom He himself created and man is to be guided by his own judgment and he is to enjoy freedom. This truth appears at its height in Christ Jesus, in whom God manifested Himself and His ways with men ... Not by force of blows does His rule assert its claims. It is established by witnessing to the truth and by hearing the truth, and it extends its dominion by the love whereby Christ, lifted up on the cross, draws all men to himself. (#11)

This weaving together of scripture and natural law is a distinguishing feature of the Catholic theological tradition, but there are different interpretations of natural law in modem Catholic thought. New natural law theorists, such as Christopher Tollefsen and Robert George, appeal to natural law to underwrite an absolutist ethical vision, concerned almost exclusively with sexuality, procreation, and marriage rather than with wider issues of social and economic justiceY Against such readings, scholars such as Jean Porter18 offer a more contingent and contextualized interpretation, arguing that natural law in the classical theological tradition has little content. It is a general set of prin-

ciples capable of accommodating a diverse range of philosophical, religious, and social constructs within its understanding of reason. Such interpretations support a liberal social ethos, requiring only such laws as are necessary to maintain public order, and with a high regard for the primacy of individual conscience.

From this classical natural law perspective, the critique of modernity offered by thinkers such as Douzinas and Agamben would be too negative. One could even argue that postmodern nihilism may be rather more attractive to Western intellectuals than to people trapped within the anarchic violence of failed states and lawless regimes-which is where the postmodern condition most fully embodies its chaos within human affairs. Those who live in the midst of violence well understand Augustine's widely quoted insight that 'The peace of the whole universe is the tranquillity of order.' 19 However, less widely quoted is what follows, when Augustine discusses the plight of those who lack such tranquillity: 'because their wretchedness is deserved and just, they cannot be outside the scope of order. They are not, indeed, united with the blessed; yet it is by the law of order that they are sundered from them. '20

Here, we glimpse the darker side of the function of law which Wolcher describes as being to *'divide* the vast realm of universal human suffering into parts: the legal and the illegal, the just and the unjust, the inevitable and the avoidable, and so forth' .21 Augustine's earthly city is not a place of egalitarian justice but of hierarchical order, in which the forces of violence must be kept at bay by the power oflaw, lest they overwhelm our fragile capacity for peace and flourishing.

At its best, then, the law maintains social equilibrium by offering some level of cpherence and predictability to ward off the threat of random violence and arbitrary punishment, but it can only do so by mastering the threat of violence. Ultimately, however, the Christian understanding of original sin as the loss of original justice means that there will always be a conflict between human laws and divine justice. In the Bible, the justice of God is not that of impartiality but, as Gushee suggests, of weakening the strong and strengthening the weak. This is what the psalmist means when he says of God: 22

> He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.

<sup>19</sup> Augustine, *The City of God,* Part II, Book XIX, Chapter 13, 870.

<sup>21</sup> Wolcher, *Laws Task,* xx.

<sup>22</sup> Psalm 72:4, 12.

For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; The poor also, and the one that hath no helper.

This partiality towards the poor-what liberation theologians call God's preferential option for the poor-is not how human laws function. As Anatole France famously wrote, 'The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under the bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread. ' 23 The justice of God takes up the cause of the *homo sacer,* and it can only be fleetingly glimpsed in the lives of those who transgress, those who willingly step across the dividing line between life and death, between insider and outsider, between those under the law and those outside the law, in order to uphold a law beyond the law on the side of those excluded by the law. In the words of theologian John Caputo:

> If justice is 'beyond' the law, that is not because justice is too big for the law but too little, because it has to do with the fragments and remains, the *me onta*  who are before the law, beneath the law, too trivial or worthless or insignificant for the law to notice, with rags and litter, the nobodies, the outsiders.24

In a creation loved and sustained by God, Christians are called to recognize grace in ordinary human affairs, and to work with those who seek justice within the existing order. However, they are also called to be attentive to those who are excluded by that order, which requires a precipitous balancing act between conformity and transgression. It is a call to be in the world but not of the world, in a way which risks rejection and punishment (e.g. Jn 15: 19). I turn now to Grimm's chapter, to develop these ideas in the context of the idea of human dignity as an absolute right, under the German Basic Law. What follows is highly tentative, informed by my reflections on extensive discussions during the conference but offering only a hesitant critique of what I find to be an impossible proposition-namely, that the law can name and defend an absolute.

# Human dignity-a vanishing absolute

Article 1(1) of the Basic Law declares that 'Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. ' 25 Grimm

<sup>23</sup> Anatole France, quoted in Wolcher, *Task,* 70.

<sup>24</sup> John D. Caputo, *More Radical Hermeneutics: On Not Knowing Who We Are* (Bloomington, IN, Indiana University Press, 2000), 139.

<sup>25 &#</sup>x27;Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany', translated by Professor Christian Tomuschat and Professor David P. Currie at the website *Bundesministerium der Justiz,* http://www.gesetze-imintemet.de/englisch _gg/index.html.

points out that human dignity is the only absolute right in the Basic Law, for the obvious reason that one cannot have two absolutes. All other rights can in certain circumstances be limited or interfered with, but 'dignity as an absolute right always trumps'. This means that it must be narrow in scope. It can and does influence other laws, but it must be sufficiently narrowly defined to enable it to be enforced.

It became clear in discussions during the conference that German judges will go to almost any lengths to find a legal alternative to claims made under Article 1(1) ofthe Basic Law, because ofthe near-impossibility of applying it in practice. This leads me to suggest that, if everyone has an absolute right to dignity, it turns out that nobody has an absolute right to dignity. But in fact, this absolute right does not apply to everyone. It is a right which applies only to those living under German law, and therefore it is a German right, not a human right. As Grimm explains, the Basic Law is addressed to Germans in public office and to state agents, it is binding only for the German state, and its beneficiaries are the citizens or the inhabitants of Germany.

For dignity as an absolute right to be invested universally in the human, it would have to trump every other law which threatens human dignity anywhere at any time in any circumstances. German law would have to act *in loco dei* if it were really to absolutize human dignity. Moreover, because the law always requires an exception to define its limits, there would have to be a category of outsiders. To reiterate, if everybody has absolute dignity, nobody has absolute dignity. So, despite the best intentions of those who drafted the Basic Law in the wake of Nazism, the term 'human dignity' smuggles into German law the right to define not only dignity but also the human according to its terms of inclusion and exclusion, and thus it cannot avoid reinstating the conditions which made the death camps possible. To say this is not to deny that there are many legal, political, and ethical factors working to safeguard the future against such a possibility, but I am expressing doubt as to whether the idea of an inviolable right to dignity can contribute to that endeavour. As Douzinas suggests, the definition of the rights-bearing human as endowed with inviolable dignity universalizes what is in fact a very particular and limited concept of who counts as human, and in that process it creates the abjected and dehumanized empirical others who fall outside its normative definition of the human.

My second, related question is that of language and the law. Grimm makes the point that the legal definition of dignity is enshrined within the law itself. Whatever theological or philosophical roots that word might have, its incorporation into law severs it from other sources of meaning. If we reflect on what this means, however, we can see that those outside the narrow remit of the authority of German law have no claim to dignity, because the law only recognizes claims framed in its own terms of reference. So any appeal to the law to recognize intrinsic human dignity on the basis of a philosophical or theological claim would fall on deaf ears. In co-opting the word 'dignity', the law also drains it of any alternative meaning. 'Bare life' is mute before the law.

This power of the law to legitimate its claims by emptying words of all their historical references and ideological inscriptions is the target of postmodem critiques of the law, such as those offered by Wolcher and others. Although the idea of the lawgiver outside the law collapses with the shift from a theocratic to a democratic order, such critics argue that the law continues to derive its power from unacknowledged religious associations, so that in one form or another what Lacan refers to as the 'unconscious God' of modernity underwrites the power of the law with the threat of some unspeakable violence.26 Postmodem theorists would insist that only by tracing the linguistic ambiguities inherent in all claims to truth is it possible to recognize the extent to which the language of the law is freighted with historical injustice and quasi-religious meanings. With that in mind, I return to the question of what Christian theology might bring to this conversation.

### The deconsecrated God

In this concluding section, I sketch what it might mean to identify Christ with *homo sacer.* Although it seems an obvious comparison, Agamben himself does not develop the potential of this association.27 John Milbank is one of the few theologians who explores its potential, although he does so in the context of a more historically focused analysis of the status of *homo sacer* under Roman law than I offer here.28

If Christianity is to respond to critics such as Douzinas, if it is to move towards the kind of vision articulated by Gushee, then it might draw on its own marginal and neglected theological resources in order to identify Christ as

*homo sacer,* so that Christ would be most starkly encountered in those abandoned, condemned, or betrayed by the law. This means, first and foremost, the abrogation of the idolatry of power that has been perpetuated through theology itself, in what feminist and liberation theologians have long argued is the unholy alliance between patriarchal and/or imperial domination and Christianity's God. Only if theology radically deconstructs all its own hubristic claims can it provide the kind of critique of modernity that Gushee proposes. Only then might theology remind the law that the language of the absolute is not within its control. As *Dignitatis Humanae* says, 'God respects human dignity.'

The language of the absolute cannot be co-opted by law, because the absolute is what remains when law has done its work. It is the exception that restrains the reach of the law. It is the justice that is discovered when the law draws a line in the sand and withholds its protection and reigns in its power. Any term used by the law is contingent and relative, including dignity. If dignity is absolute, then it is all or nothing, and I am suggesting that only when it becomes nothing under the law does absolute human dignity, respected by God, become an imperative that transcends every law and every context. Those who tum away in disgust, blame, or shame from the *homo sacer* are turning away from God as revealed in the suffering humanity of Christ, who was born of a virgin outside the laws of nature, and was tortured and killed in an act of mob violence outside the laws of religion and politics. Christianity as a religion belongs within the natural order of human laws and institutions, but it reveals its truth only in the radical act of the transgressive individual who follows Christ into the wilderness, to discover him in the refugee, the prisoner, the infant born into poverty, the criminal tortured and crucified. 29 'And the King shall answer and say unto them, "Verily I say unto you, Since you have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, you have done it unto me"' (Matt. 25:40).

The language of kingship is significant here. As *homo sacer,* Christ must be both sovereign and outcast. The distinction between divine sovereignty and human abjection must be collapsed, if sovereignty beyond the law is to empty itself into the bodies of those beneath the law-those who constitute 'bare life'. Milbank asks, 'what is the point of identifying oneself with bare life in order to escape earthly sovereignty, only to fall into the hands of cosmic tyranny?' 30 If the idolatry of power invested in the idea of God is to be

challenged, then the idea of God must be deconstructed. If Christ is only the victim, then Christianity's God becomes the most vicious and abusive tyrant of all. Again, feminist theologians have pointed out the extent to which the Christian idea of God as an angry father who will only be appeased by the torture and death of his son is a violent theology with deadly political and ethical implications. Rather, to quote Milbank again, we must ask what solidarity with Christ means, if we recognize him as 'the God abandoned as *homo sacer*  upon the cross' .31

Gushee argues that every human is sacred from the perspective of divine law, but if everybody is sacred nobody is sacred. Where, then, is the exception that delineates the sacred? Let me suggest that, if the crucified Christ is *homo sacer,* and if he is fully divine as well as fully human, then on the cross God becomes the exception to the sacred. In Christ, God is profaned, and every human sacrifice in the name of God, or in the name of any secular equivalent that has usurped the place of God and still demands such sacrifice (the state, the market, the law itself), is unmasked as the idolatry that it is. Original sin then becomes associated with the sin of idolatry which violates the first commandment: 'You shall have no other gods before me' (Ex. 20:3). This idolatry would refer to every human concept of God that justifies violence against another human in the name of the idolatrous constructs of the divine which have legitimated so much of Christianity's bloody history. Every human is sacred, because God is not sacred. No human can be violated, killed, or abused in the name of God, because to violate a human is to violate God. God is the exception, the excluded other who makes the human sacred-who divinizes the human, according to classical theology-by the emptying out of sacred divinity into the sacred humanity of Christ (a theological term known as kenosis).

When Christianity says that the fully human body on the cross is fully divine, it provides a theological response to the problem of law and sovereignty;and it gives material, historical expression to that idea of divine justice expressed by the psalmist, which turns all our human laws and institutions inside out. If, as Wolcher argues, ethical reflection on good and evil justifies the infliction of suffering on those who are deemed to be evil, then the first task of Christian ethics is, according to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, to invalidate the knowledge of good and evil that is acquired through rebellion against God in the Book of Genesis.32 Christ drains away the divine legitimation of the law by saying that outside every possible law, outside every possible act of saver-

eignty or autonomy, God is to be found as the most vulnerable, the most destitute, the most profaned, the least sacred thing in all creation-the infant born among the animals, and the human corpse on the cross: 'He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not' (Isa. 53.3). The greatest good is revealed in the greatest evil, and the ancient rupture in human knowing is healed so that justice might once again be possible.

Jon Sobrino is a Jesuit priest and liberation theologian from El Salvador. In his book *The Crucified Christ,* he revisits the questions of liberation theology from the perspective of a double grief. First, he is grieving over the failure of liberation theology, after the collapse of communism and the rise of global capitalism destroyed the utopian dreams of a socialist future informed by a Marxist critique of economics and a Christian affirmation of the God of the poor. Second, he is grieving over the murder by the Salvadoran military of six fellow Jesuits, his housekeeper, and her daughter while he was out of the country. Here is what Sobrino says about the crucifixion:

> The cross reveals, not power, but impotence. God does not triumph on the cross over the power of evil, but succumbs to it. The faith-interpretation ... sees in this the love of God in solidarity, to the end, with human beings, but what appears on the cross on the surface is the triumph of the idols of death over the God of life. The idea that in the battle of the gods the true God could lose and through that defeat prove himself the true God requires us to rethink his transcendence.33

Christianity has indeed been a religion of empire, power, and conquest, but beyond its corrupted laws and institutions, there are the 'bare lives' of those who have/followed a different way. These are the saints and martyrs-most of them buried in unmarked graves-who willingly stand alongside the unwilling victims of history, who recognize that 'bare life' is God's life, and there and nowhere else is it possible to affirm the absolute dignity of the human, beyond the power of any law and beyond the politics of any state.
