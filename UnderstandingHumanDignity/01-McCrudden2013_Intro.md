## **In Pursuit of Human Dignity: An Introduction to Current Debates**

#### *Christopher McCrudden*

THE coNCEPT oF HUMAN DIGNITY has probably never been so omnipresent in everyday speech, or so deeply embedded in political and legal discourse. In debates on welfare reform, or in addressing the effects of the current economic crisis, appeals to dignity are seldom hard to find. When Nelson Mandela spoke against poverty, for example, he spoke in terms of a 'right to dignity and a decent life' .1 The concept of dignity is not only a prominent feature of political debate, but also, and increasingly, of legal argument. Indeed, since the European Court of Human Rights, among others, tells us that human dignity is the foundation of all human rights,2 it is clear that human dignity will continue to be a central element in legal argument into the future.

The power of the concept of human dignity is unquestionable. It appears to present a simple command to all of us: that we (individually and collectively) should value the human person, simply because he or she is human. But are we all singing from the same hymn sheet when we use the concept of human dignity, and is it a problem if we are not? Human dignity often seems to be used on both sides of many of the most controversial political debates: on issues such as abortion, assisted suicide, genetic experimentation, freedom of expression, and gay rights, human dignity is invoked to justify apparently conflicting positions. Does this demonstrate that the concept is hopelessly vague and excessively prone to manipulation? Or does the existence of dignity arguments on both sides of controversial debates simply demonstrate the complexity of moral argument? Addressing the fundamentals of human dignity, and thereby furthering our understanding of how we might better comprehend the concept, has never seemed more opportune.

#### Why now?

The use of the language of dignity is not, of course, a new phenomenon, so why does the discussion about human dignity appear to have become so much more intense over the last few years?3 As an issue in the history of ideas, the reason for the relatively recent pervasiveness of dignity discourse is interesting and problematic. Several explanations have been advanced, relying on the relative failures of alternative ethical approaches to gain sufficient traction. Dignity's role is to supply a value, or a set of values, that other approaches do not.

One explanation for the increasing importance and salience of debates about dignity relates to the discourse of human rights in general. With the increased political salience of human rights, and the increased use in litigation of human rights language, has come increasing attention on the theoretical underpinnings of human rights. This has tended to demonstrate how contested the foundations of human rights are. The familiar story is that when the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was being drafted in 1948, the participants were able to agree on what they were against, but not on *why* they were against these violations.4 Human dignity, so the story goes, was inserted as a placeholder when those drafting the Declaration failed to agree on any single foundation.

Since the 1970s at least, the human rights enterprise has become both more powerful and more controversial, legally, politically, and ethically, and this absence of a clear agreement on the foundations has threatened to undermine the project. Many human rights instruments invoke dignity rhetorically, sometimes consciously to bridge agreement on concrete rights and deeper foundations without achieving agreement on the latter. As practical use of concrete rights proceeds, nagging questions about foundations come to the surface and beg for further discussion. From this has come the urge to revisit the concept of human dignity, in order to examine whether it is more than a placeholder and whether it can provide the needed foundational principle.

3 Samuel Moyn, for example, points to the exceptional burst of interest in dignity in Anglophone liberal philosophy in the last five years: Chapter 4, this volume. Thomas Hill is more sceptical of the alleged neglect of dignity among contemporary philosophers, see Thomas Hill, Chapter 17, this volume. 4 See Jacques Maritain, writing in the introduction to a symposium held by UNESCO in 1948: 'It is related that at one of the meetings of a Unesco National Commission where Human Rights were being discussed, someone expressed astonishment that certain champions of violently opposed ideologies had agreed on a list of those rights. "Yes", they said, "we agree about the rights *but on condition that no one asks us why."* That "why" is where the argument begins.' Jacques Maritain, 'Introduction', in *Human Rights: Comments and Interpretations,* symposium edited by UNESCO (New York, Columbia University Press, 1949).

A specific example of dignity's greater visibility in the context of debates about human rights can be seen in the area of bioethics. Developments in the life sciences, in biotechnology particularly, have provoked deep moral concerns about the direction and the practice of this science.5 In the Germanspeaking world, this debate became particularly intense from around 2000, when issues concerning stem-cell research and other issues of biotechnology generated considerable public and scholarly debate. Dignity is seen, potentially, as placing limits on some developments in these areas of scientific development. This is particularly the case in those areas of biotechnology that relate to genetic engineering and other technologies involving human enhancement. Human enhancement is identified as problematic, it is said, because it compromises human dignity. 6

These concerns have led to a plethora of legal instruments and official reports that identifY human dignity as a cornerstone principle that must be safeguarded.7 The 2005 UNESCO Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights, for example, provides, in its section dealing with human dignity, that the 'interests and welfare of the individual should have priority over the sole interest of science or society'.8 For many of its detractors and proponents, human dignity acts as more of a complete limit than other ethical viewpoints, a 'conversation stopper'. 9 The relative effectiveness of human dignity in that regard has led to considerable resistance to the use of dignity by some scientists working in these areas.

### Dignity's history

What, if anything, does the study of history bring to our attempt to understand the various meanings accorded to the concept of human dignity? More specifically, where there are disagreements among historians about dignity's

history, what is at stake in these debates? The first point to bear in mind is that the history of human *rights* is itself a relatively new scholarly phenomenon. Recent historical debates over the sources of human rights have tended to concentrate on four periods. There is a lively debate on whether rights discourse has its origins in the idea of natural rights in the Middle Ages, with the canonists and Roman law to the fore. 10 Some argue that the decades of the French and American Revolutions of the late eighteenth century is the critical period, while others emphasize the 1940s and the development of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Most recently, several scholars have emphasized the 1970s as marking a decisive shift in the embedding of human rights theory and practice. Samuel Moyn sees developments in the 1970s as marking a significant break from the past. He emphasizes the discontinuities, and resists the notion that the development of human rights should be seen as linear. 11 In particular, Moyn argues that it is mistaken to see the development of human rights in the late twentieth century as inevitable, resisting a teleological explanation, and pointing to the many contingencies and choices that arose along the way when a different road could have been taken.

Given the close connection between human rights and human dignity, there has also been an understandable tendency, in this recent history, simply to regard the two ideas as different sides of the same coin, and a separate history of human dignity has yet to be written. Where should such a history of human dignity, as opposed to a history of human rights, start?

Several different approaches suggest themselves. One approach is to identify the original use of dignity as high status, and stress the increasing challenges to distinctions attached to such high status in the period of the Enlightenment. We see in the immediate aftermath of the French Revolution the abolition of aristocratic 'dignities', and increasing disapproval of dignity in the sense of the bearing or demeanour associated with aristocratic status. 12 Another approach is to date the emergence of human dignity from when it became a legal concept distinguishable from, but intertwined with, human rights. Moyn, Christoph Goos, and Rebecca Scott provide the opening salvos for such a history. Scott identifies 1848, and the decree that abolished slavery in the French empire on the basis of its incompatibility with human dignity, as an important breakthrough, as this seems to be the first mention of dignity

in its modem sense in a major legal text. 13 Or perhaps we should begin later, in 1919, which saw both the creation of the International Labour Organization and its emphasis on dignified working conditions, and the adoption of the Weimar Constitution with its mention of dignity in the broader context of socio-economic working conditions. Or perhaps the critical date is 193 7 and the adoption of the Irish Constitution, with its inclusion of dignity in the Preamble, 14 or 1949, with the adoption of the German Basic Law. 15 Or was it, perhaps, 1948, with the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and its multiple uses of dignity, initiating the use of dignity in international human rights texts? There are various ways of justifying each of these dates.

Why do such debates about the origins of dignity in public discourse matter? The word 'dignity' has been used in different contexts and semantic fields, and its scope and meaning are not identical. A key distinction is between popular uses of dignity and dignity used in theoretical or legal contexts. Some of the controversies that this raises are fairly typical of debates in current historiography more generally. Should the history of dignity be seen, for example, as a top-down or bottom-up process, contrasting Scott (bottom-up, vernacular) with Goos and Moyn (top-down, legal, and theoretical)? Clearly a bottom-up approach is more likely to avoid the 'intellectual elitism' that is said to follow when the focus is on the use of the term by great authors, and certainly it is less likely to underestimate the importance of the struggles ofnon-intellectuals. 16

The issues of particular relevance to this book are those historical controversies that shed light on how we can begin to understand the use to which the concept of human dignity has been put. The use of dignity in the German Basic Law and the Universal Declaration, for example, differs from that in the anti-slavery texts. In the latter, dignity is used as a reason or a justification for the abolition of slavery. In the case of the German Basic Law and the Universal Declaration, in contrast, dignity appears as a protected good itself. As Catherine Dupre argues, the history of human dignity can have different starting dates and, depending on the choice of dates, we construct a different history as a resultY

Dealing with the historical use of dignity discourse seems particularly challenging because historians are necessarily embarking on a theoretically and politically loaded project. That may appear, perhaps, to be less critical if

<sup>17</sup> Catherine Dupre, Chapter 5, this volume.

all that the historian is doing is identifying the appearance of a particular word in particular texts (although, even then, identifying a non-English term as being equivalent to 'dignity' brings with it important ideological challenges). Where historians are not just looking for words or terms, however, but looking for the presence of an idea in human history, 18 then the historian is more clearly likely to come to the project with an already formulated view of what the concept of human dignity involves.

Even the apparently more restricted enterprise of identifying the historical appearance of the word 'dignity' carries with it significant theoretical challenges, particularly if the enterprise is see11 as attempting to discover 'first use' of a word that describes an inherent quality and an inherent value that resides in human beings that deserves respect. If dignity can be dated in this way, and if dignity emerged quite recently, then the implication is therefore that there are grounds to doubt its objective credentials. True, a certain language may be invented to discuss this aspect of human reality, but if 'dignity' is 'invented' then does this challenge the idea that it is timeless? If it could be shown to be invented, then we would have an account of the use of dignity language that did not reveal it to be responsive to the subject matter to which some think it is meant to be responsive.

But is this not to fall into the genetic fallacy? It does not follow that an idea is false merely because it has been recognized only recently in history as an idea. A less controversial approach would be to locate the use of a term identifying a particular set of understandings, without saying that this use 'invented' that particular set of understandings. For example, if one reads the nineteenth-century slave narratives, powerful claims are made by the slaves themselves as to their subjectivity, but this intuition may or may not have been articulated as a claim for dignity.

The issue then arises as to whether the same thing is being historicized. We shall see that there are different ways of thinking about dignity: as something institutional (in which case the issue for historians is when the word was used by particular institutions, such as judicially, legislatively, constitutionally), or as a concept that captures a set of understandings (in which case other words might be used to capture that set of understandings, say subjective personality), or we might be interested simply in the use of the word (in which case the word might be used for several different purposes). A rich history of dignity would combine these differing approaches, and we need to be aware that the explicitly historical chapters in this book are presented only as fragments of that richer history.

<sup>18</sup> Matthias Mahlmann in discussion at the conference and in Chapter 35, this volume.

Short of producing this richer history, what is at stake for current controversies about dignity? The first issue that the chapters address implicitly is the extent to which there is a continuity of the use of dignity language. Scott argues that in certain shared contexts, for example in slave labour either in its classical form, or in the form of modem slavery, dignity plays an importantly similar role, with a relatively similar meaning in both situations. Scott's inquiry is set in the context of slavery, but it is of relevance more generally in the discussion of work and working conditions. Moyn, on the other hand, has a very different understanding of the process. As part of his wider project of stressing the discontinuities between what might be seen as sparks of human rights thinking and today's human rights movement, Moyn stresses the foundation of Ireland's adoption of dignity in the 1937 Constitution in Catholic social teaching, and the links between this and the development of conservative Christian Democracy, rather than seeing it as the beginning of anything that would lead, he argues, to the very different phenomenon of international human rights of the type that emerged in the 1970s. 19

The second area of current controversy that these histories touch on is how far Kantian or Catholic thinking influenced the adoption of dignity in various constitutional texts. We shall see that both strands of thought are of importance in current debates, but this question of their historical influence is of importance not least because it indicates how far a conception of dignity as meaning an inner transcendent core of value was the 'original' meaning in particular contexts.

Goos indicates that the subsequent importance of this Kantian understanding of dignity in the German constitutional debates in the late 1940s was not so important as has been thought. Moyn's argument is that Catholic thought was influential not only in Ireland, but also in the development of dignity in the German state constitutions such as in Bavaria. But Goos appears sceptical as to how far Catholic thought was critical in the German federal constitutional debates. Goos's careful archival research shows that while some considered that dignity was best viewed as a 'non-interpreted thesis' (to be explained below, but essentially meaning a placeholder)/0 others regarded it as something quite specific, and in particular they viewed it as an idea of 'inner freedom', which we can define as the freedom from compulsion to act against one's own convictions. Goos agrees with Moyn that the Jewish Holocaust itself was not critical in stimulating the adoption of a language of human

dignity, at least in the German constitutional debates, but that the experiences of the Nazi concentration camps in general were critical in the adoption of this idea of dignity as 'inner freedom'. David Hollenbach21 and Matthias Mahlmann22 are much more sceptical ofMoyn's argument in this respect.

## Different conceptions of dignity: a preliminary sketch

It is clear, even from what has already been said, that there are significantly different conceptions of human dignity in play historically, and in current use. It is useful to try to systematize these different usages at this point, even in a preliminary way, before discussing the implications of some of them in more detail. We can identify, for example in the context of Scott's discussion of slavery, how a person's human dignity was seen as requiring that people should be *treated with dignity,* meaning that respect should be shown to them as individuals. Other uses are apparent too; for example, indignity was seen as being present when human persons were reduced to the status of animals-human beings were seen as having a normative moral status different in kind from that of other animals and other living things. We shall see that this second idea of dignity has two important implications: that dignity is seen as involving questions of appropriate *status,* an approach that has become a central view in some recent philosophical discussion. Jeremy Waldron, for example, sees dignity as currently concerned with raising everyone to the rank and status that only aristocrats formerly enjoyed.23 The emphasis on indignity also suggests that dignity may be best understood by focusing on the negative rather than on the positive, and this has given rise to an argument that indignity is primarily about humiliation, as Avishai Margalit suggests.24 There is clearly an important question to be considered regarding the relationship between treatment with respect and according a common (higher) level of status to individuals, an issue explored by Michael Rosen. 25

In Goos's discussion, we can identify several additional and competing conceptions of dignity: human dignity as derived from man being made in the image of God *(imago Dei);* the view ascribed to Kant that dignity requires

us to treat people as ends in themselves rather than simply as means to an end; the idea of dignity as 'inner freedom'; and (in both Goos and Moyn) dignity as a concept that captures the idea that all human beings are morally considerable simply by being human, indeed that all persons have incommensurable value-the view that Rosen describes as involving a belief that human beings (and only human beings) possess an 'inner transcendental kernel' that is valuable.26

Moyn usefully distinguishes between the use of dignity as applied to the human person from what he terms 'corporatist' conceptions of dignity, where dignity is attached to institutions like Parliament or the Church, an understanding that is perhaps rooted in the older eighteenth- and nineteenth-century meaning of dignity as distinction and status. We shall see that Christopher Tollefsen considers that many different things (animate and inanimate) can be seen as having 'a dignity', and that we can refer to the dignity of legislation, for example, or the dignity of labourY Is the same conception of dignity in play in these contexts as when we speak of *human* dignity? To what extent is it appropriate to refer to the dignity of marriage, as Tollefsen himself does; or to the dignity of animals, an issue that Joseph Vining considers?28 And to what extent is dignity a useful tool of analysis when we consider the question of the religious freedom of churches and the freedom of church members considered collectively, the issue that Julian Rivers considers?29 Waldron has referred to the *dignity of legislation30* and the *dignity of citizenship,31* and others have referred, on occasion, to the dignity of courts, or the dignity of the nation state, or the dignity of ambassadors. The issue, then, is whether the idea of dignity that we would apply to *persons* is the same as that which we would apply to institutions such as marriage.

It certainly seems likely that the underpinning of human dignity attached to ordinary men, women, and children, differs significantly from claims that might be made of the dignity of some particular political arrangement or institution. The fact that dignity can be attached to institutional *competitors,* for instance, supports the argument that different values may support different corporatist uses of dignity; so we talk about the dignity of monarchy *and* the dignity of democracy; we can talk about the dignity of legislation *and* the dignity of constitutional courts striking down legislation. One could argue

in favour of some corporatist applications of dignity on what are thought to be dignitarian grounds based on personhood (such as the dignity of labour), but there is no necessary guarantee that an argument that attaches dignity to an institution will always be supported by such dignitarian values. Utilitarian values, for example, sustain the dignity of the market; values concerned with liberty might underpin the dignity of Churches. We should not assume in what follows, therefore, that arguments that relate to *human* dignity necessarily support broader conceptions of corporatist dignity.

The fact that dignity is used in many contexts far removed from those traditionally associated with human rights is important for another reason. We will observe how frequently the two concepts are seen to be connected by many of the contributors to this volume; indeed, we shall see how some argue that a principle criterion for assessing how convincing a particular interpretation of 'dignity' is, is to see whether that conception of dignity would provide a convincing justification for the broad range of human rights currently contained in regional and international human rights instruments. 32 It is worth bearing in mind that all such arguments will assume a necessary connection between human rights and human dignity, a connection that needs to be convincingly argued for rather than assumed. We shall consider subsequently what the relationship between human rights and human dignity might be in more detail, and we shall see how controversial that claim is. We should not assume that 'dignity' (or 'human dignity') is coterminus with 'human rights'. Nor, if we are to understand the meaning and function of 'dignity', should we see it only through the lens of human rights.

### Dignity-critique: power politics

We can glean from these historical chapters that the concept of dignity is not ideologically fixed in its meaning, thus allowing the term to be used by those with quite different perspectives; dignity may be adopted by those with a religious perspective, or a secular philosophical perspective, or a political perspective. This is the sense in which Theodor Reuss referred to dignity as a 'non-interpreted thesis', a concept 'that is not fixed in its meaning and can therefore marry otherwise opposing views' .33 What are the implications of this?

<sup>32</sup> An issue discussed by John Tasioulas, Chapter 16, this voliune.

<sup>33</sup> Doris Schroeder, 'Human rights and human dignity: an appeal to separate the conjoined twins', *Ethical Theory and Moral Practice* 15:3 (2012), 323, at 326.

As many contributors show, dignity can often function as a placeholder, accepting that there is no acmal or possible agreed articulation of its content. Indeed, some may wish to avoid any too-critical analysis of the concept, preferring to advert to the core mystery of the person, an intuition that reveals the ethical demands for respect. Some will undoubtedly be impatient with inconclusive and potentially never-ending debates, and may prefer to opt for a placeholder idea of dignity without even that content. However, the absence of analysis and critical reflection on the meaning of and reasons for the assertion of human dignity could then leave a vacuum to be filled. This too has its dangers, which Jiirgen Habermas would identify as the likely colonization of the life-world by strategic rationality, potentially distorting the recognition of human dignity and the protection of the rights founded on it. In other words, the interests of the law, or of politics, would shape the meaning of dignity in practice, not always with benign consequences.

For Costas Douzinas, dignity is an empty or flawed signifier, and a hegemonic battle is taking place to capture the concept for one particular ideolo- . gy.34 All abstract universals, he argues, tend to be hegemonized for a period of time by particulars that struggle to call themselves universal.35 Whether the claimed universal is the sacredness of life, or free will, or autonomy, or humanity, each is trying to hegemonize the universal, in other words to turn their particularity into a universal validity. Dignity, then, simply provides another vocabulary for asserting conflicting claims. For Douzinas, only a political and moral commitment to a groundless humanity, continuously open to redefinition, to localized struggles of resistance and revolt, and to an undetermined future can release us from the oppressive power and violence of abstract concepts such as human rights or human dignity. 36

Tina Beattie provides a detailed critique ofDouzinas. Her analysis is that, in common with much postmodern theory, Douzinas presents a pessimistic view-of the human condition, 'which could be seen as the secular derivative of the doctrine of original sin', and 'the distant heir to Augustinianism and the theologies of the Reformation, although shorn of their themes of judgment and redemption'. She sees Douzinas as advocating utopian revolution, and asks whether such revolutions reduce, or actually stimulate, the oppressive power and violence that he professes to abhor.37 She adopts John Gray's

<sup>37</sup> Tina Beattie, Chapter 14, this volume.

argument that utopian revolutions have been the seedbed of every kind of terror, fascism, and genocide since the Enlightenment. 38

A less dramatic way of reading Douzinas, however, is to see his argument as concerned with the centrality of politics in the definition and application of concepts such as human dignity, and that we ignore political power at our peril. The debate that this generates is manifold, but one particularly important element is whether certain elite uses of dignity, particularly perhaps in the legal context, lead to unacceptable constraints on democratic decisionmaking. Conor Gearty argues that because the concept of dignity comes and goes, varying over time, and because there are so many competing versions of it, it is not a concept that should be overseen by the courts.39 For Gearty, the competing versions of dignity, which cannot easily be reconciled, prompt the question: who should decide between these competing versions? For Gearty, those kinds of issues in which dignity is so often brought to bear (the right to die, abortion, etc.) are issues that should be decided in a representative assembly. They need to be concretized in legislation, and the judgments made should be provisional rather than permanent.

Douzinas and Gearty thus significantly develop the more sceptical tone of the discussion of dignity already identified with Moyn and Rosen, and they level several charges, echoing those set out by Rosen:40 that dignity in the hands of the judges is potentially anti-democratic; that dignity is subject to abuse at the hands of the powerful; that it is conceptually muddy; and that it can end up being used on both sides of the argument. There are two difficulties with these arguments. One is that some of the characteristics of dignity these sceptics identifY as problematic are seen by others as positive advantages. For example, is muddiness an advantage or a defect? While Moyn considers the current imprecision in the use of dignity is a defect, for others it is a sign that the concept is alive and functioning well (for example, Scott appears to welcome a certain lack of certainty in the use of dignity). Or we might think, with Aharon Barak, that imprecision is neither defect nor strength, but rather Â· just a fact of normative life with which judges, like other institutional players who have responsibility for determining the terms of our joint existence, must grapple.41 A second difficulty with some.ofthese criticisms is that these objections to dignity may simply be criticisms that are no different from those

commonly applied to other concepts. Waldron, for example, considers that we should not be afraid of the possibility that dignity might be used on both sides of some important questions. 42 He argues that this is also true of liberty; indeed, it is true of almost every major value. Instead of being a criticism, it is a tribute to dignity that it might be engaged on both sides.

## Dignity's functions

In light of this flexibility in its substantive meaning, the utility of dignity may lie more in the functions that it fulfils rather than in any uniqueness of meaning as a basic moral concept. Several of the contributors to this book focus, therefore, on the different *functions* of dignity. We have already encountered several functions that the concept of human dignity may fulfil. There is its political function as a flag under which the dispossessed unite and fight for freedom, equality, and basic resources. In this context, dignity becomes a useful vehicle for an expanding idea of empathy. In addition to Scott's case study of post-slavery organization, a good example of this is provided by Edwin Cameron's description of the use of dignity in providing a tool for combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in post-apartheid South Africa.43 There is also human dignity as an institutional notion employed in a constitutional structure that confers on judges a certain discretion to make moral judgements, fleshing out the constitutional protection of human rights, proving a mechanism for providing some basic protection from political give and take, and also from utilitarian calculation.44 If this is extended to the view about what law and legal actors *ought* to do, Denise Reaume appears to take a similar approach. For her, judges *ought* to use dignity this way.45

Although Bernhard Schlink, as we shall see, is sceptical whether dignity brings any significant added substantive meaning to many legal debates, he nevertheless argues that there is an important *functional* justification for holding onto human dignity as a concept.46 Dignity, he argues, functions as *Sehnsuchtsbegriff,* a concept that encapsulates our yearning for a recognition and protection ofhumans that is not up for grabs (political grabs, balancing grabs).

It is characteristic of *Sehnsuchtsbegriffthat* the *Sehnsucht,* the yearning that the concept of human dignity encapsulates, will never be fulfilled and that it will be often severely disappointed, but that we need it anyway. Because we all long for this recognition and protection, even though we do so in different ways, as moral philosophers, as lawyers, or as theologians, dignity functions as a concept around which we can meet and discuss. As we have seen, this was one of the underlying rationales for choosing the issue of dignity as the basis for the multidisciplinary conference that forms the basis for this book.

Schlink's argument hints at an important function that dignity may play, a function that has attracted recent scholarly attention and is also significantly reflected by other contributors to this book. This is the use of dignity as a vehicle for attempting to secure consensus in the face of disagreement about comprehensive positions or starting points. Rather than regarding dignity as a conversation stopper,47 dignity becomes an occasion for dialogue, partly because it is a 'non-interpreted' thesis that nevertheless appeals to some undefined set of yearnings. Thus, in the scholarly literature and, indeed, in some of the jurisprudence and constitutional doctrine, it is sometimes said that one of the functional values that the concept of dignity fulfils is to provide a language in which conflicting values, and even conflicting rights, can be brought into relationship with each other, and this is reflected in several contributions.

For Reva Siegel48 (and Paolo Carozza, using somewhat different language),49 the possible good of dignity might be to keep 'agonists' in one conversation, rather than to supply technical directions about how these conflicting values and rights are to be accommodated.50 Observing the structure of struggle around dignity, Siegel argues that a conversation among agonists, each of whom is committed to dignity, at least involves a common fidelity to dignity, even as they profoundly disagree about its entailments and about the forms of human flourishing to which dignity may refer. So, on that view, dignity's virtue is not that it provides answers but that it may create the conditions for the task of trying to look for an answer to, or at least an accommodation of, conflicting values and rights. Others may be more sceptical about the depth or acceptability of any integrative function that dignity may serve. For David Albert Jones, dignity plays a limited role in securing agreement in debates over abortion, where there is fundamental disagreement over the status of the

foetus. 51 There seems little point in keeping agonists in conversation when their conversation is premised on a false belief that they agree about anything in the first place.52 It is a question of empirical judgement whether dignity actually does do any work in terms of helping us reconcile or accommodate competing claims.

## Dignity as foundation and the foundations of dignity

Before considering those who take a different approach, seeing dignity as more than simply an empty vessel open to capture, or primarily as a functionally useful device for allowing dialogue between those who fundamentally 'â€¢ disagree, an important distinction should be made. We have identified previously that for some the primary issue is whether and how far dignity provides a suitable foundation for other things, particularly for human rights law and practice. So, one critical set of debates is concerned with the issue of dignity as foundational. There is, however, an additional issue which others are more concerned to explore, which concerns the foundations of dignity; in other words, what is dignity based on and are these foundations secure? The latter set of debates can lead to frustration for those concerned with the former set of debates, because it seems to result in a never-ending cycle of explorations of foundations. For some concerned with the use of dignity as a foundation for human rights, as we have seen, the attraction of dignity is the extent to which it is a 'conversation stopper', a concept that neither requires nor permits any further digging. Those engaged in the exploration of the foundations of dignity, however, resist this approach, seeking to open up these foundations to Â· further scrutiny and contestation.

## Catholic debates: revisionism and anti-revisionism

Many religions consider dignity central to their understanding of what it means to be human, and there has been much recent writing exploring dignity from the perspective of various Christian traditions as well as from Jewish and Islamic perspectives _53 The contributors to this book tend to focus mainly

(but not exclusively) on Catholic perspectives, if they consider religious arguments. 54 In recent years, the Catholic Church has been engaged in discussions about the nature and basis of human rights, drawing on the rich tradition of thinking about 'human dignity' by Catholic theologians. We are, then, not only at a key juncture as regards the legal and philosophical framework of human rights but also as regards its theological foundations. Theologians are increasingly engaging in discussions on how the notion of human dignity is to be understood from a religious perspective.

In this book, as was pointed out earlier, it is particularly the Catholic which is the most developed theological perspective. James Hanvey introduces the theology controversies and locates the Catholic approach, 55 including the idea of the human person being made in the image of God *(imago Dei).*  Janet Soskice picks up on the importance of *imago Dei* and develops some of the implications. 56 David Walsh introduces the idea of eschatology57 as a way of accessing the transcendence of the person in the context of debates about how to understand human dignity. 58 Tina Beattie extends this debate with the notion of the desacralized God. 59 David Gushee challenges the underlying assumptions of the engagement and offers an alternative approach.60

In order to understand these and other theologically oriented contributions in this book, it may be useful to set them in the context of some of the broader debates within the Catholic Church over human rights. Going back to 1948, as Moyn suggests, the founding documents of the internationalist strand of the modern human rights movement were influenced by Catholic thinking; not only by Catholic thinking, of course, because there were undoubtedly many influences in the drafting of the Universal Declaration. Given this diversity of viewpoints, the strategy adopted by those drafting the Declaration was to put to one side the deeply contested problems of where human rights come from, and what their foundations are, in favour of reaching a consensus about what specific fundamental rights could find universal acceptance.

John XXIII is critical in providing a bridge between this post-Second World War human rights discourse and the *magisterium* (the teaching of the Church), culminating in *Pacem in Terris,* the papal encyclical that did more than any other single document to signal a rapprochement between Catholic teaching and human rights developments at that time. This was subsequently confirmed and developed by the Second Vatican Council ('Vatican II') in *Gaudium et Spes61* and *Dignitatis Humanae. 62* 

During the 1960s, there was a significant opening up to human rights thinking. Why the Catholic Church was willing to adopt human rights thinking is still the subject of considerable historical investigation and interest, but in part it is likely that the human rights agenda was seen as having sufficient with Church positions on issues of justice, welfare, and the common good to be worthy of support; that the Church's decline as a secular power resulted in greater self-awareness of the Church's moral voice in the world, a voice that could be articulated in the language of human rights; and that the development of Catholic understandings of freedom of religion and conscience was partly articulated in human rights terms. It is also probable that the influential involvement of Catholics in the drafting of both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights in the late 1940s was seen as giving a seal of approval to the process, further underpinning the presumption that human rights would have little disruptive effect on Church doctrine and practice (not least because of the apparently strong protection for religious freedom within these human rights documents).

Given this apparent rapprochement, what needs to be explained is why there is now such a widely shared view inside and outside the Church that significant gaps have opened up between the Catholic *magisterium* and aspects of human rights thinking. 63 Now, more than sixty years after the Universal Declaration, deep questions are resurfacing as human rights language in law, philosophy, and theology, providing the arena in which rival conceptions of the human person and the common good of society become articulated and debated, in particular in the areas relating to gender and sexual orientation, but also in contexts relating to the beginning and end of life.

Support for human rights can be seen as an example of the difficulty the Church faces in reacting to aspects of modernity. Bernard Lonergan's 1967 essay is a useful starting point.64 In it, he contrasts two modes of thinking about meaning, those characteristic of 'classical' atid those characteristic of 'modem' culture, with the former being ahistorical and essentialist, secure in having a clear and accepted meaning, while the latter is more historical and inductive. Catholic moral theology, born in the former, is now confronted, according to Lonergan, with the latter world of meaning. Lonergan anticipated a split in Catholic theology in which 'a scattered left' develops, 'captivated by now this, now that new development, exploring now this and now that new possibility', in contrast with 'a solid right that is determined to live in a world that no longer exists'. 65

John Langan, although using the terms 'revisionist' and 'anti-revisionist', has acknowledged a similar The main factors making for revisionism are: the importance of historical conscientiousness; the general theological awareness that doctrine develops; the desire for a more culturally and psychologically sensitive pastoral practice; and the social distance between ecclesial authority and the profession of theology. The main factors making for anti-revisionism are: an essentialist, rule-oriented, and significantly biologistic conception of natural law as developed in neo-scholasticism, with a strong emphasis on its immutability and universality; and the assertion of papal authority in moral matters since the mid-nineteenth century (in the First Vatican Council), with a preoccupation on infallibility and the irreversibility of Church teaching.

This discussion is relevant for the issues of dignity because it puts into perspective several intellectual developments that took root in the late 1960s and contributed to opening up the perceived gap between the human rights movement and the Catholic Church. One :of these involves developments within secular human rights and human dignity discourse itself, particular in the area of equality. With the increasing emphasis on racial and gender equality from the 1960s onwards, morphing into a more general concern to enable individual identities to be valued and protected, equality discourse took on a strongly individualistic, autonomy-based, anti-essentialist, and constructivist quality.

<sup>66</sup> Personal communication on file with the author.

There are, of course, several different meanings that may be intended by the use of the term 'essentialist'. I use it here to refer to the idea that 'definitions are descriptions of the essential properties of things, and that one can evaluate attempts at definitions in terms of the falsity or truth of the descriptions given by them' .67 Essentialism is now most used in the social sciences as a description of a position that is regarded as outdated, a term of criticism rather than approbation. As Simon Blackburn explains, 'Essentialism is used in feminist writing of the view that females (or males) have an essential nature (e.g. nurturing and caring versus being aggressive and selfish), as opposed to differing by a variety of accidental or contingent features brought about by social forces.' 68 Often such 'essentialism' is seen as based on biological determinism. It is this understanding that anti-essentialism seeks to challenge, viewing institutions and roles as socially constructed and provisional. In particular, social identities are seen as socially constructed and changeable. Human rights discourse and, to a notable extent, human rights law, has significantly (but by no means uniformly) adopted an anti-essentialist understanding of 'equality as dignity'. 69

These revisionist and anti-revisionist approaches have both affected doctrine and practice within the Catholic Church since then, and to the extent that these approaches differ this has contributed to internal tensions. Some of these effects will be considered in a moment, but in one respect at least those adopting opposed positions within the Church do not differ. Both approaches are based on interpretations of 'natural law'; and those who adopt these approaches do not consider that either is narrowly 'religious', as both appeal to reason and the natural order. Before turning to consider some aspects of these debates, it should be noted that there are four main sources of Catholic doctrine in addition to the *magisterium,* including biblical revelation, natural law, tradition, and human experience. This multiplicity of sources means that, taken together, they can be interpreted in a variety of ways that tell different stories about what that religion requires. Perhaps of particular significance, it means that these sources require sophisticated interpretation, and an important source of such interpretation is the work of current theologians.

### 'New natural law' as anti-revisionism

Another set of intellectual developments affecting the relationship between the Catholic Church and human rights thinking concerns the idea of 'natural law', and the relationship between attempts to understand the concept of dignity and 'natural law' .70 Although, as we have seen, 'natural law' is one of the sources of the Catholic *magisterium,* that does not make natural law 'religious', which is to confuse the idea of 'natural law' with the (other) beliefs of (some of) its adherents. The criticism has been made, understandably in some cases, that those espousing 'natural law' may interpret it in such a way as simply to justify the existing Catholic *magisterium,* rather than using natural law as an independent basis for assessing and contributing to the evolution of the *magisterium,* but the former is a misuse of 'natural law'. Those who purport to interpret 'natural law' do so, they say consistently, on the basis of practical reason, and those interpreting it and the conclusions they reach are therefore open to being criticized on the basis of practical reason.

Significant developments have taken place in discussions of 'natural law', which some would characterize as 'anti-revisionist'. From the early 1960s, there was a sustained attempt to rethink and reformulate the foundations of 'natural law' in a way that grew from and was seen by its proponents as consistent with Thomist approaches. One of the most influential of these attempts was what came to be called, originally by its critics but increasingly its proponents/1 'new natural law'. 72 'New natural law', as articulated by a group of scholars around Germain Grisez, and including John Finnis and Robert George, became in practice a controversial anti-revisionist approach within the Church. 'New natural law' was seen by some elements of the Church hierarchy, particularly in the USA, as supportive of the more traditional elements of some of the existing *magisterium* and in tum to be supported and encouraged, particularly after the bitter controversy that arose within the Church on the publication of *Humanae Vitae,* the Papal Encyclical that continued the

<sup>70</sup> There is a large and complex literature on the meaning and implications of natural law. See, for example, the chapters by John Finnis and Brian Bixin Jules Coleman and Scott J.

prohibition on Catholics using contraception. 73 'New natural law' is, however, a complex phenomenon, and not one that can be easily pigeonholed.

From the perspectives of those writing in the 'new natural law' tradition, represented in this book by George74 and Tollefsen/5 religious approaches to dignity and approaches based on natural law and practical reason must be kept quite distinct. Echoing Galileo's claim that the Church teaches how to go to heaven, not how the heavens go,76 while deriving a moral norm is the business of practical reason, to the extent that that moral norm is dependent on science, then scientific understanding is determinative. Taken on its own, however, the scientific claim does not deliver the moral norm, otherwise there would be a considerable danger of falling into the naturalistic fallacy. For example, on issues such as when life begins, Tollefsen does not consider that there is any answer from a religious perspective to this question; indeed, for Tollefsen that is the wrong place to look for an answer. Instead, he argues, one should consider what scientists say on issues of embryology and embryological development. In the context of debates about abortion, whether we should regard the foetus as a 'human being' initially involves consideration of the scientific issues around the behaviour of the new organism (the human embryo) brought into being by the union of gametes (fertilization). The Church can teach that it is wrong to kill an innocent human being, but the scientific claim about when a human being's life begins is essential for applying that teaching at life's earliest stages.

Tollefsen's understanding of dignity, as we have noted earlier, is that it refers to a particular kind of excellence that each thing has. From this perspective, a lot of different things can be seen as having dignity. *Human* dignity involves recognition of the excellence that persons have; their inherent worth as persons. The issue is this: what is the basis on which such an idea of intrinsic dignity should be based? He considers that a capacities-based approach establishes the basisfor intrinsic dignity in this sense. However, as Emily Jackson argued,77 if humans are special because of their special characteristics, then what are the implications? Animals like dolphins, whales, and the great apes share some of those special characteristics, whereas persistently vegetative human beings do not. Why are the lives of animals not also in some sense sacred?

Tollefsen further distinguishes an ethical sense of dignity from a political sense of dignity. The ethical sense of dignity has two aspects: a task aspect

<sup>77</sup> In discussion at the conference.

(what we need to live up to in order to realize the demands of our dignity) and the constraints that our dignity places on others. Similarly, the 'political aspect' of dignity has a task aspect (the politics that we need in order to fully realize our dignity as persons in community with others), and the constraints that our dignity, as both individuals and in community with others, creates relative to the state. Perhaps more straightforwardly, this conception of dignity thus entails both rights and obligations.

One structural feature that these instantiations of dignity, whether applied to things or to humans, have in common (other than both referring to an idea of excellence) is that if something can be excellent, or is excellent by nature, it can also typically fail with regard to its characteristic activity of excellence. It can fail with regard to what Tollefsen characterises as its 'task'. So, for example, if we think ofthe 'dignity oflabour', we should view it not just as involving issues of what kinds of constraint that creates for other people, it should also involve consideration of what kind of obligations it creates for the people who are engaged in labour.

## Catholic 'revisionism'

Hollenbach illustrates well elements of a more 'revisionist' approach within the Catholic tradition. 78 For Hollenbach, Vatican II appealed both to the creation of all persons in the image of God, based on revelation, as well as to the results of the use of human intelligence, to provide a basis for dignity. The grounds for human dignity based in revelation and those reached inductively based on practical reason illuminate each other rather than standing in conflict. Hollenbach argues that the interaction of reason and faith in shaping the Catholic understanding of dignity is a historical process, leading to notable revisions in the Catholic stance, and it will continue to do so. His strong emphasis on practical reason means that the Catholic Church should not be reaching premature decisions about complex questions of bioethics, for example, when there has not been a sufficient experience combined with reasoned reflection upon it to reach a conclusion about what human dignity demands.

This approach involves several different elements, all of which are controversial. An anti-revisionist critique of Hollenbach would argue that there is a tension between, on the one hand, being inductive, being responsive to history, and to the developmental aspects of Catholic understanding of how

78 Hollenbach, Chapter 6, this volume.

dignity applies, and, on the other, retaining the appeal of dignity as universal. Indeed, going further, Hollenbach might be criticized for surrendering the religious to the secular, advocating that the Church should simply follow the movements of culture. Dignity would then become determined by society, with the Church simply tidying up afterwards.

This criticism assumes, however, that the Church is not now and has not always been deeply engaged with secular culture in developing its understanding of Church teaching, sometimes for the good and sometimes in unfortunate ways. Christianity started off in the first century AD, for example, with a very strong opposition to torture, but through the appropriation of Roman law came not only to endorse torture but to practise it. There are also examples, however, of progressive influences from secular culture that (sometimes grudgingly) led to significant changes in Church teaching, notably the acceptability of women in the workplace, and their right to be treated equally at work. So, too, the Church eventually reversed its position on torture, again influenced by developments in secular politics, and now declares that torture is one of the most fundamental violations of dignity of the person-an offence against God.

This change in teaching, in both cases, was influenced by the complex interaction between the Church and secular culture that led to changing understandings of dignity and its implications. For Hollenbach, the moral is not that the Church should refuse to engage with culture, but that its conclusions as to what to understand from that culture should be modest, and in particular that the Church should be very careful about coming to premature absolutes in situations where human experience is still fast evolving. For Hollenbach, this approach echoes Thomas Aquinas's awareness of the implications of natural law: that the most fundamental principles of natural law are evident to all reasonable people and are changeless, but that the *applications* of these fundamental principles may not be at all self-evident and are changeable.

#### Women, sexual orientation, and marriage

Given these differences between 'revisionist' and 'anti-revisionist' approaches, it is not surprising that Catholic understandings of the role of women and of the behaviour of gay men and women, as reflected in the writing of Catholic theologians, reflect a considerably greater plurality of viewpoints than those outside the Church sometimes appear to recognize; in particular, there are different understandings of the meaning and implications of dignity for such issues. To suggest otherwise is to impoverish a vibrant and (most importantly) *continuing* discussion within the Church. The major difference, for the purposes of this discussion at least, is in anthropological understanding. One key issue is that of sexual 'complementarity'. There is debate within the Church as to the appropriate understanding of this 'complementarity', and the result is a sharp dispute, *within* the Church, over what is required to ensure human flourishing. In the contributions to this book we see this tension vividly on display.

Dignity language is used on both sides of the internal debate/9 and there is sharp disagreement as to what human dignity requires. Sometimes a revisionist understanding of dignity is evident, particularly in the social teaching of the *magisterium,* and sometimes an anti-revisionist approach to dignity is evident, particularly in some of the teaching of the *magisterium* in areas touching on gender and sexual orientation. The use of dignity within Catholic discourse (understood broadly) is sometimes confusing, often uncertain, and always evolving.

On the issue of same-sex marriage, for example, and whether the idea of 'marriage' should be used only in the context of the 'conjugal' (or as some would say 'procreative') conception of marriage, George's position is that this should not be a debate about religion. 80 No religion invented the conjugal conception of marriage. Religions can recognize it; they can give expression to it in their revelation, as the Hebrew Bible does in Genesis; but they did not create it. So, too, the state through the legal system cannot create it, although again the state can recognize it. The state can also abolish it by law, but the state cannot eliminate the reality, as he sees it, that marriage in this form and structure is a basic good of the human person. This idea of conjugal marriage is also supported, he argues, by other norms associated with marriage that have a long historical pedigree, including sexual fidelity, monogamy, and permanence of commitment.

As it is based on practical reason and human experience, one way of responding is to question how coherent the results of the reasoning undertaken by 'new natural lawyers' are. For example, we can consider whether the

8Â° For Robert George's views on the conjugal conception of marriage, see Sherif Girgis, Robert P. George, and Ryan T. Anderson, 'What is marriage?', *Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy*  34 (2010), 245. This paper elicited criticisms from Kenji Yoshino, Andrew Koppelman, and Barrie Deutsch, among others. George and his co-authors responded to those criticisms in a series of online exchanges, and have turned these articles into a book which includes responses to critics, published as Sherif Girgis, Ryan T. Anderson, and Robert P. George, *What* is *Marriage?: Man and Woman: A Defense* (New York, Encounter Books, 2012).

<sup>79</sup> It is also used differently even within the various competing approaches. For example, different authors within 'new natural law' place somewhat different emphasis on the importance and centrality of dignity to their enterprise. John Finnis, for example, treats it very briefly, for example in *Aquinas: Moral, Political, and Legal Theory* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998), 17 6-80, whereas Patrick Lee and Robert George have given the concept much more extensive treatment and importance; see, for example, 'The nature and basis of human dignity', *Ratio Juris* 21 (2008), 173.

procreative view of marriage is coherent by considering its possible implications, and challenge its apparent roots in long historical practice. From Tollefsen's and George's perspective, would it be wrong, for example, for those who are knowingly infertile or post-menopausal to marry? More importantly, if a person in a relationship with another has a condition such that they could not perform penetrative sex, would they be wrong to marry? Does it matter if consummation only became a condition of a valid marriage in the Middle Ages, meaning that the tradition has changed quite dramatically from an earlier tradition when celibate spiritual marriage was often seen as an ideal? Other questions may be raised about the implications of the argument that marriage is a basic good: if marriage is a basic good, why is it threatened by the extension of the same rights under law to same-sex people? Why does a 'procreative marriage' gain in strength from denying the right to marry to people who would choose a different understanding of marriage?81

However, for those supporting the retention of the concept of sexual complementarity in the conception of marriage, a set of questions arise if the idea of sexual complementarity as essential to marriage were to be abandoned. How is it that marriage is to continue to be understood as inherently a *sexual*  partnership, as opposed to a partnership that might just as well be integrated around other (non-sexual) activities or mutual interests, depending on the subjective preferences of the spouses? What ground of principle can be adduced for regarding marriage as a union of two persons as opposed to three or more in polyamorous sexual relationships? What ground of principle can be identified (if any can be) for honouring the norms of monogamy, sexual exclusivity (fidelity), and a commitment to the permanence of the marital bond? Why should law and the state recognize and regulate marriages at all, as they have historically done, rather than treat them as private matters, the way they treat other friendships?

#### Beyond revisionism and anti-revisionism: Christian personalism

The dichotomy between revisionism and anti-revisionism is useful as a heuristic device, but can easily be overdone. Langan's reading of Lonergan can itself be contested. As described previously, Langan translates Lonergan's 'scattered left' and 'solid right' into the language of 'revisionism' and 'anti-

<sup>81</sup> These issues are similar to those raised by critics of the original article and are addressed in the forthcoming book of the same name, see previous footnote. John Finnis has also addressed some of these issues in his 'Sex and marriage: some myths and reasons', in *Collected Essays,* vol. 3: *Human Rights and Common Good* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2011 ), 353-88.

revisionism' (I have further exemplified Hollenbach as the former and 'new natural law' as the latter). But in the passage from which it is drawn, Lonergan criticizes both the 'scattered left' (as being too relativistic and uninterested in continuity) and the 'solid right' (as reactionary and living in the past). In describing the debate within the Catholic Church simply in terms of revisionism versus anti-revisionism, one may lose sight of the fact that both positions are open to criticism. Lonergan himself, crucially, proposes that 'what will count is a perhaps not numerous centre, big enough to be at home in both the old and the new, painstaking enough to work out one by one the transitions to be made, strong enough to refuse half-measures and insist on complete solutions even though it has to wait'. Neither 'revisionists' nor 'anti-revisionists' succeed in getting the whole picture right, and what some seek is 'to be at home in both the old and the new'.

This unease about dichotomy may explain why it is difficult to locate the popes in office immediately before Pope Francis (John Paul II and Benedict XVI) comfortably in either camp. (Pope Francis's approach may differ; it is too soon to tell.) These recent popes have been seen as representing a distinctly different theoretical approach that has been termed 'Christian personalism', which attempts to bridge the classical and the modem forms of thought in a way that is faithful to the notion of essence and to the notion of history. Walsh's chapter is implicitly in this tradition,82 but Joel Harrison83 and Clemens Sedmak84 are the most explicitly 'personalist' in perspective, and readers unfamiliar with this tradition may welcome a brief account of why it is important to the issue of human dignity.

There is a very considerable variety of 'personalist' metaphysical approaches. The particular type of personalism that is the focus of attention here is in the form of 'Christian personalism' or Thomistic personalism, and is associated with French Catholic debates during the interwar period, in particular those involving Jacques Maritain. Thomas Williams has identified the core of personalism as a school of thought or intellectual movement that 'focuses on the reality of the person ... and on his unique dignity, insisting on the radical distinction between persons and all other beings (nonpersons)' *.SS*  But there is more to it than that.

of persons' but also 'a concern for the person's subjectivity, attention to the person as object of human action to be treated as an end and never as a mere means, and particular regard for the social (relational) nature of the person'. Personalism, therefore, has been viewed not only as an important influence in strengthening the use of the concept of dignity within Catholicism but also, via Maritain, in contributing to the development of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in particular its emphasis on human dignity.

Today, personalism is seen as helping to bridge revisionism and antirevisionism. In France during the interwar years, personalism was seen as bridging another divide. It 'arose as a reaction to impersonalist modes of thought which were perceived as dehumanizing', 86 whether based on radical collectivist ideologies, such as Communist and Marxist materialism, deterministic ideologies such as Nazism or racism, or radical individualism as espoused by utilitarians and Nietzsche. For Maritain, personalism was 'a phenomenon of reaction against two opposite errors (totalitarianism and individualism)'.87 The rejection of totalitarianism is seen in the emphasis given to subjectivity (with its view of persons as free and responsible moral subjects, giving rise to the responsibility of others to respect this), and the prohibition on treating others as means rather than ends, with strong echoes ofKant.88 The rejection of radical individualism is seen in the identification of the person in relationships, as a social being in community with others.

Maritain espoused a variety of 'personalism', although he distanced himself increasingly from some of those who claimed to be 'personalist' after the Second World War, particularly Edward Mounier. His disagreement with Mounier is of importance because it illustrates an important point about 'personalism': that the balance that personalism sought to retain between individualism and community left it open to 'capture' by *both* the political left and . the political right. The communitarian left and right can claim that personalism supports an authoritarian world view;89 the libertarian right and left can

Maritain dissented from the direction that Mounier took personalism in the 1940s and 1950s because he considered that Mounier had taken personalism too far towards collectivism in the form of French communism.90 But personalism could equally well have become the basis for a *rapprochement* between *conservative* forces and Catholic intellectuals. The very strength of personalism, its centredness, may be its fatal weakness, capable of veering from one to the other extreme when tested. The same weakness may be evident in its current use as a bridge between both 'revisionism' and 'anti-revisionism'.

## Beyond practical reason: revelation, *imago Dei,*  experience, mystery

Thus far, the emphasis has been squarely on those contributors who focus on the use of practical reason. Gushee's argument draws from an alternative Christian tradition that is Protestant and evangelical, focusing more on revelation and on divine command than Hollenbach, Tollefsen, and George. 91 Gushee sets the discussion of dignity in the context of a consideration of the sacredness of human life. For him, the sacredness of human life is rooted in the will of God. No reason is given for why God should declare and decide to value human beings. It is not based on anything intrinsic about humans or their capacity (in contrast to Tollefsen). He does not argue that the value of a human being is not fixed or exalted, simply that its fixity and elevation is based on divine decision, command, and love, rather than on something about the human being itself that imbues it with intrinsic value. One reason for this move on Gushee's part is the danger that as soon as we identify a particular aspect of the human being as that which confers intrinsic value or dignity, its absence in a particular individual can then be taken as warrant for treating that human as less than sacred. Gushee's approach is thus a direct challenge to the capacities-based approach to human dignity suggested by Tollefsen. The obligations that flow from Gushee's approach are no less important. A person who believes Gushee's account is called to respond by adopting a posture that begins with reverence for the person, and by accepting responsibility for human life. It includes offering due respect and care to each human being that

the destructive nature of individualism, moreover, justified the use of state power for the purpose of enforcing social values in the economic sphere.'

we encounter and extends further to specific obligations to protect human life and to foster human flourishing.

The contrasts between Gushee's and Hollenbach's approaches are intriguing, and take us into complex debates. For Gushee, the sacredness of human life is simply a divine decision, and this appears to indicate a significant difference between Hollenbach and Gushee. Second, there is a distinct difference in the role that revelation plays, with Gushee emphasizing the importance of biblical sources for his argument, and Hollenbach concentrating more on practical reason. Third, unlike Hollenbach, Gushee does not consider that it is particularly helpful to draw on the concept of *imago Dei,* or at least not one based on the image of God as presented in Genesis.

As regards the role of *imago Dei,* the issue is to what extent, if at all, this provides an adequate basis for the intrinsic value of the human person. Traditionally, the core Christian notion of human dignity is to be found in the image of God, and Soskice considers that there are significant advantages in the concept of' *imago Dei'* over 'sanctity of life' as a guiding theological notion in end-of-life issues, for example. 92 *Imago Dei* is seen within Catholic teaching, in particular, as pointing in the direction of human beings as free and rational, and it is this that distinguishes human persons from others. Each and every person has an intrinsic value because of that. Sergio Dellavalle's critique of *imago Dei* points to the principal disadvantage of *imago Dei's* close relationship with religion being its possible parochialism: an idea of dignity based on this understanding is accessible only to the adherents of a religious group, and seems to exclude others. 93

There are, of course, several religions that have used the idea of the *imago Dei* in connection with developing an understanding of human dignity, but often in very different ways. Margalit introduces a Jewish reading of the Hebrew Bible's description of man being created in the image of God, in which human beings, and only human beings, are seen as icons of God. 94 This does not lead, however, to humans having intrinsic value because only God has intrinsic value. The value of humans is the reflected glory that human beings have, but they do not have intrinsic value. They have a value only as icons of something else that deserves adoration.95

#### 30 *Christopher McCrudden*

For Hanvey, an account based on the account of creation in Genesis presents an impoverished understanding of *imago Dei.96* Like Gushee, Hanvey prefers a broader reading of the canon that gives multiple sources for a claim to divinely conferred human dignity, one not just based on Genesis. A reading based only on Genesis does not take sufficiently into account the very substantial change in our understanding of *imago Dei,* rooted in Christian tradition, particularly the teachings of Augustine, who links the idea of *imago Dei*  with the idea of the Trinity, that is the idea that God is three 'persons' in unity. If one believes that God is Trinity, then in what sense are humans, created in the image of God, also Trinitarian? For Hanvey, in contemplating and reflecting on the nature of the 'persons' in the Trinity, the concepts of reciprocity, mutuality, and equality can all be derived, thus contributing significantly to a richer understanding of human dignity. For Hanvey, then, the human person is not an icon in the sense used by Margalit. The human person is not a *representative* of God-or a carrier or cipher of God's holiness; the human person from the Christian perspective possesses the *imago Dei* as part of their being. It can be debased, it can be effaced; but it cannot be lost, and this, according to Hanvey, carries a meaning that is ontologically stronger than that presented by Margalit.

There are much deeper divisions between the contributors than over the meaning and the role of *imago Dei.* At this point, we can return to consider criticisms that have been levelled at dignity, including by Rosen.97 Several criticisms identify what, ifthey are true, are unambiguously dark aspects that appear to be specific to dignity: that it is a kind of fa9ade; that it provides a false consolation for inequality; that it is a Trojan horse for religiously inspired attacks on various aspects of liberalism, such as equality; and that dignity justifies attacks on autonomy, understood as the power of choice.98 Often linking these criticisms of dignity is the frequently expressed view that the relationship between organized and hierarchical religions and the use of dignity has been in the past, and remains currently, somewhat problematic.

As we have seen, Douzinas argues that human rights and dignity are historically contingent terms, with significant shifts in their meaning depending on their contexts, and always vulnerable to co-option on the side of abusive power. 99 In particular, Christianity's universalization of the term 'human', he argues, has lent legitimacy to the West's colonial violence, and this has continued

<sup>98</sup> The use of dignity-language in new natural law would be likely to feature as an example of the dark side of dignity by critics of that approach.

<sup>99</sup> Douzinas, *Human Rights and Empire.* 

even when human dignity became secularized. Beattie contrasts Douzinas and Gushee. 10Â° For Douzinas, Christianity is part of the problem, and Marxist, Nietzschean, and Freudian perspectives offer a vantage point for criticism. However, for Beattie, Douzinas may be thought to be too monochrome and pessimistic in his telling of history, for he fails to acknowledge how often Christianity has inspired the very kind of revolutionary visions for which he calls. Gushee, on the other hand, while recognizing that history offers plenty of harrowing examples of Christianity abandoning its own best theology and ethics, nevertheless considers Christianity to offer the solution, and Nietzsche and Nihilism to be the problem. 101 The task of the Christian intellectual is, Gushee suggests, to retrieve the richness of the sacredness of human life from the thinner versions that secularism offers.

The contrasts between Hollenbach and Gushee also raise directly the relationship between debates within theology and debates external to theology, and the relative importance of revelation to each. Gushee argues that the norms regarding the sacredness of human life are rooted in the Old and New Testaments, which includes the idea ofthe image of God in Genesis but goes beyond it. This is a richer, thicker concept than secular conceptions of dignity, he argues. Leaving to one side whether the sacredness of human life is rooted in biblical texts, there is a significant difference between them as to whether secular conceptions of dignity are being developed that may have their own richness without being mere pale imitations of the religious. The principal issue dividing Hollenbach and Gushee involves a disagreement over the appropriate relationship between the sacred and the profane in theological development.

Walsh argues that there are movements of the Spirit in the world outside Church and religion, and part of the way the Church has been called to account is by moral advances within secularization, especially within the realm of rights and dignity. 102 The language of rights and dignity, he argues, has become an external moral challenge to Christianity. For Hanvey also,103 secularization is not necessarily seen as bad, since it too is to be regarded as the work of the Holy Spirit, and the Church is obliged to follow the Good wherever it occurs. Hanvey argues that theology should develop its own selfcritique. Vital to that self-critique are secular liberal understandings of dignity. Theology needs a secular understanding as well as a theological understanding if it is to keep true to itself. Beattie goes further, in calling for 'the abrogation

<sup>100</sup> Beattie, Chapter 14, this volume.

<sup>103</sup> Hanvey, Chapter 11, this volume.

of the idolatry of power that has been perpetuated through theology itself, in ... [an] unholy alliance between patriarchal and/or imperial domination and Christianity's God' .104

It would be misleading, however, to underemphasize the tensions between secular philosophical and religious understandings of dignity. Vining's contribution is a good starting point for exploring this tension. 105 He suggests that the individual we perceive is something more than the product exclusively of two factors usually identified (genetic and environment, nature and nurture, as those terms are now widely used). There is, he suggests, a third element, either implicit or sometimes given a name, which goes beyond reason, thus challenging those who see reason as the only way of approaching the concept of persons or of their dignity.

Hanvey's contribution is also a challenge to an over-concentration on the role of reason in theology. 106 For Hanvey, theology must always begin in humility before a truth that it cannot fully grasp and a reality that it cannot fully know or exhaust. It is always a struggle to understand. Although Hanvey clearly values rational argument, he argues that theology should never forget the limits of reason. The fact that theology cannot grasp the mystery of what it seeks to understand is not an occasion of despair, or an occasion of selfcriticism. Nor is the understanding that human dignity is in some sense a mystery in any way a conversation stopper; dignity's capacity for inexhaustible meaning allows, encourages, indeed *requires* further conversation.

An emphasis on 'mystery' is also embedded in Sedmak's contribution. 107 Sedmak adopts an understanding of human dignity as a requirement to treat people as human beings rather than as objects. Treating people as objects leads to two particular problems: first, we lose the sense of what he terms the 'interiority of the person'. Rather than seeing the depth of the person, one sees the person as if he or she was a table or a chair. Second, he suggests, we lose an appreciation of the importance and the role of vulnerability, and we end up abusing the most vulnerable. Appreciating vulnerability provides an insight into our own human nature. Thinking about our own vulnerability gives us a deep first-person insight into how we are, who we are, and what human beings in general are. Vulnerability also provides a litmus test: how we deal with the most vulnerable members of society tests our commitment to dignity. Interiority, for Sedmak, can give us a deeper sense of self-respect, but it also, and

is the link to Hanvey's reflections, gives us a sense of the inner structure of the person, and of the person's *mystery.* 

We have seen earlier that one of the criticisms levelled at dignity by secular thinkers is that dignity is based on a religious understanding of the person, and of the person's relationship with the divine. In terms of the contributions to this book, that key issue is raised most prominently by those contributors writing about the relationship between dignity and freedom of religion. For Rivers, 108 for example, dignity needs a theological referent to do the work of protecting freedom of religion, and one that probably needs to be grounded in some sort of minimal theism if it is to escape the current trend towards autonomy-based justifications for state burdening of religious practice. Freedom of religion needs more than merely the capacity to construct a subjective understanding of the divine; it needs to presuppose the capacity actually to relate to the divine.

## Philosophical debates

References to 'mystery' and to 'minimal theism' have important implications for the relations between theological and philosophical understandings of dignity. John Tasioulas, for example, distinguishes between religious propositions that are accessible to natural reason from those that are not, and asks what the added value of a faith that cannot be vindicated by natural reason is. 109 In particular, even ifthere is an added value that religion brings to dignity, does it have a valid political role to play if it is specifically based on faith considerations that cannot be backed up by natural reason? From Tasioulas's philosophical perspective, religious reasons can be relevant in understanding human dignity but only to the extent that they can be 'cashed out' in terms of reasons (the term is his). In any political context, one would have to say that texts embodying dignity language contain something that can be expressed, and defended rationally. Talk of 'mystery' clearly complicates this analysis.

Scepticism of dignity because it is seen as dependent on religious understandings of the person is also seen when it is viewed as dependent on metaphysics that is not explicitly religious. Rosen, for example, is dismissive of Immanuel Kant's understanding of dignity for this reason, viewing Kant as conceiving of dignity as a 'transcendental kernel' .110 The problem for Rosen is

<sup>108</sup> Rivers, Chapter 23, this volume.

<sup>109</sup> Tasioulas, in discussion at the conference.

<sup>110</sup> Rosen, *Dignity.* 

that this would mean that Kant derives his ethical belief from unsupportable, obscure, and non-empirical metaphysics. Thomas Hill, however, challenges this assessment as incorrect. 111 Although he accepts that there is a 'widely shared impression' that Kant's understanding of dignity is 'hopelessly mired in an obscure and untenable metaphysics', and that this is 'understandable', this view is nevertheless misguided. Kant's understanding of dignity, argues **Hill,** is not a mysterious metaphysical 'kernel' from which we derive our belief in the moral law and its practical applications. Not even in his so-called 'metaphysics of morals' does Kant actually try to base morals on metaphysics, as traditionally conceived.

In this consideration of different ways of understanding human dignity, we have moved decisively to consider those contributors who focus on attempts to pin down more precisely what they see as the substantive content of human dignity, and who view it as having significant added value in normative ethics. Jones, for example, argues that dignity adds something uniquely valuable to debates on assisted suicide and abortion that is not reducible to other principles. 112 We shall be looking now at how contributors from the disciplines of philosophy and law consider this, but before turning to these individual disciplines and the debates within each of them, it may be useful to set out several broad alternative approaches that are frequently adverted to in these disciplines.

Broadly, three alternative approaches to the study of normative ethics are often distinguished. One approach, well known at least in outline, emphasizes the consequences of actions, and often involves the adoption of a utilitarian approach to problem-solving, asking whether one or other solution will maximize well being (however that is conceived). A second approach, which is commonly characterized as a 'deontological' approach, emphasizes duties, or rules, and sometimes rights. A deontological perspective would consider whether a proposed solution to a problem involves acting according to one or more appropriate moral obligations. A third approach, relatively neglected in modern ethics but attracting increased interest in recent years, as discussed by Soskice, 113 is termed 'virtue ethics'. This is the view that says that what is fundamental in ethics is not principles of conduct but excellences of character (virtues), and the emphasis is on the exercise of these virtues, which its proponents would say are more broadly conceived than in consequentialism or deontology; these virtues are not only important, they are foundational. Each

<sup>111</sup> Thomas Hill, Chapter 17, this volume.

<sup>112</sup> Jones, Chapter 31, this volume.

<sup>113</sup> Soskice, Chapter 12, this volume.

of these broad approaches ( consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics) is more in the nature of a group of theories rather than one central theory, and this (very) brief outline raises serious issues, of course, which go far beyond the topic of this book. These complex issues need not detain us, however, not least because none of the philosophical contributors to this book fits entirely comfortably within any of these three commonly identified approaches when discussing dignity.

Tasioulas's approach to dignity is grounded in a richly developed philosophical approach that is offered as an alternative to all of these. 114 Both Kantianism (as a form of deontology) and utilitarianism are, he considers, act-focused theories, concentrating on the question of what is the right act to perform. For Tasioulas, there is a prior question: how to view things correctly before one proceeds to action. On this distinction hangs much of Tasioulas 's analysis, and it is therefore important to point out that the distinction is a controversial one, in the sense that not all would support his apparently sharp distinction between acting and preparing to act.

Assuming that there is such a distinction, however, how should we describe Tasioulas's position? There is no generally accepted term for this perspective, distinct from deontology, consequentialism, and virtue ethics, but the one that Tasioulas has used in the past (as has James Griffin) is 'teleology'. 115 Unlike classic deontology, for example in Kant, teleological views treat the human good as basic in morality, and believe that moral norms are in some sense derived from considerations about the good. Unlike consequentialism, teleological views do not assert that only consequences, and not the intrinsic nature of acts, matter morally. Unlike virtue ethicists, virtues are not morally foundational, even though they are important. What *is* foundational for teleology is considerations of human good and human flourishing.

Tasioulas's philosophical conception of dignity is that it is an intrinsically valuable status possessed by all human beings simply in virtue of their humanity, and discoverable by ordinary moral reasoning or through natural reason. One of the things one needs to see correctly before acting, he argues, is the intrinsic value of other people, in other words their human dignity. All human beings have an intrinsic worth as human beings, and their interests count equally and are not to be subject to certain kinds of interpersonal tradeoffs. There is undoubtedly a distance to travel from that perception to the identification of what the precise practical implications of this insight are, and this requires practical wisdom, but at least it seems to satisfy the need to

<sup>115</sup> See John Tasioulas, 'Taking rights out of human rights', *Ethics* (2010), 675-8.

produce a comprehensive theory that incorporates the idea that human rights are grounded in dignity. Where Tasioulas differs from other proponents of this idea is in his insistence that dignity alone is insufficient to justify the familiar schedule of human rights, and that in addition we have to invoke universal human interests as grounding values.

At the level of moral reason in a purely formal sense, virtue also figures in Roger Brownsword's reflections on human dignity, but, like Tasioulas, he would not consider himself to be a virtue ethicist. 116 For Brownsword, 'the moral' (whether as in a 'moral community' or a 'moral way of life') commits its adherents to trying to do the right thing for the right reason. For moral persons, the focal virtue, we might say, is to try to do the right thing for the right reason. 117 However, once we declare our favoured criterion in relation to doing the right thing, Brownsword adopts a deontological approach (specifically a Gewirthian rights approach): 118 we should try to respect the rights of others (this being the right thing) for the reason that this is the right thing to do. 119

The demand that human dignity be respected can be equated with the 'moral' in this sense. For Brownsword, this moral command is unlikely to have any real chance of being followed in practice unless there is a supportive societal context. He considers that the context in which we try to do the right thing for the right reason is currently unsupportive in two respects. The first is that the colonizing effect of the risk society and its risk-focused discourse makes it difficult to raise certain sorts of moral concerns. 120 The second arises from the fact, as he sees it, that new technologies present regulators with huge opportunities to manage environments that fundamentally change the way in which individuals are directed and channelled, so that even if we do the right thing we are no longer doing it freely or for the right reason. In this respect, we may see one of Brownsword's primary concerns in practice is a concern with autonomy. 121

Dignity as freedom or autonomy is a popular conception of dignity, particularly in the USA. There is a stronger version of this argument, and a weaker version. Some appear to consider that dignity is simply autonomy (the strong argument), while others would not put the argument that strongly, considering it to be one strand that is worth emphasizing in particular contexts. Siegel considers that one of the crucial ways in which thoseÂ· in favour of decriminalizing abortion in the United States and Germany conceptualized their claim was in this form. 122 So, too, we can see in the argument advanced by Cameron that a similar conception of dignity, one based on the importance of protecting particularly important choices, was adopted in the context of claims that criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct in post-apartheid South Africa was unconstitutional. 123 Similarly, social and economic rights are sometimes seen as necessary because they attend to those material needs of the human individual that help to guarantee an individual's authentic capacity to choose; this also arises in Reaume's discussion. 124 In all these instances, human dignity is seen as in a certain sense protecting and instantiating a dimension of human autonomy.

One prominent philosophical version of this has been advanced by Griffin, who in a recent important book argued that human dignity is not a kind of basic moral status, the intrinsic worth of being a human being (as Tasioulas interprets it), but rather consists in one particular interest, an interest in freedom. 125 Tasioulas outlines several difficulties with this approach, but there are essentially two. 126 First, it seems to present an impoverished understanding of the grounds of human rights to see them as purely protecting freedom. So, from Griffin's perspective, the reason why torture constitutes a violation of human rights is that it undermines the capacity of the person tortured to make decisions and stick to them. Tasioulas considers that the fact that torture is incredibly painful is not, in Griffin's argument, relevant to it being a violation of human rights, and that this is fundamentally mistaken. Second, Tasioulas argues, a focus exclusively on freedom means that human rights standards do not protect human beings incapable of agency.

An emphasis on dignity as freedom and autonomy alone also appears to pose significant difficulties as a foundation for a significantly robust understanding of freedom of religion. The chapters by Rivers, Dellavalle, Riordan,

and Harrison explore this theme. Rivers sets out the area of debate, and Dellavalle, Riordan, and Harrison make a case for three different options for addressing the issue: a richer notion of the good of religion (Riordan), a richer notion of moral autonomy and discursive community (Dellavalle), and a broadened theologically informed notion of the human person (Harrison). 127

Dellavalle examines received accounts of the human on which the assertion of dignity has been grounded. 128 As we have seen, he finds wanting the familiar theological notion of the human as *imago Dei* since it tends to invoke a particular religious experience of a specific community in relation to its God, which is not accessible to members of other communities. Dellavalle also considers the modern account of the human in terms of autonomy and conscience to be inadequate, since while it can ground an important value of toleration and a protection of a sphere of negative liberty, it does not offer a basis for recognition in the sense of a positive valuing of the plurality of religious expressions. It is this theme of recognition that moves Dellavalle to favour a communicative understanding of the human, following Habermas among others. But is Dellavalle's preferred communication action account vulnerable to the same kind of criticisms he has himself aimed at the *imago Dei* model, namely the inevitable exclusion of those who do not share the enlightenment rationality presupposed by Habermas or the skills of articulate debate? Could an account of an ideal type of discourse supplant t4e actual discourse between proponents of different positions on the meaning of dignity, in particular as it grounds the promotion and protection of the freedom of religion?

Taking a different tack, Patrick Riordan also finds flaws in the grounding of dignity in the exercise of autonomous choice. 129 Drawing on Ronald Dworkin's account of dignity as rooted in the human freedom to make lifeshaping choices, Riordan highlights the implications of this for the further level of debate in the grounding of rights. This grounding of dignity can possibly result in the elimination of the freedom of religion as a distinct right among the list of basic human rights, since religion is interpreted as one life choice among others, and given the freedoms of conscience, of speech, and of assembly, requires no distinctive protection. Countering this tendency, Riordan argues for an ontological grounding of dignity in an account of the kind of being that humans are, one more open to the distinctiveness of religion as a form of life, not reducible to a choice. But is Riordan's hoped-for ontology

<sup>127</sup> I am grateful to Julian Rivers for this summary.

<sup>129</sup> Patrick Riordan, Chapter 24, this volume.

sufficiently robust to resist the charges of essentialism directed at previous attempts?

Rivers also reacts against the narrowing of the understanding of religion when the freedom of religion is understood in terms of a dignity founded on individual freedom. 130 He points to two dangers arising from this tendency. When religion is interpreted as a personal life-choice, nowadays often labelled one's spirituality, it becomes privatized and is deprived of political and legal relevance. The second dimension of religion in danger of being excluded is its social and communal nature. Religion is institutionalized in various forms, and as such plays a significant part in civil society, but when its communal and institutional nature is denied, religion is disarmed as a countervailing power to the influence of the state.

Harrison similarly argues that the autonomy account of dignity, and consequently religious liberty, undermines religious groups as sites of authority pursuing particular social ends beyond self-determination. 131 In contrast to Dellavalle's communicative understanding, he contends that religious liberty discourse faces competing political and social imaginaries (drawing from Charles Taylor). He argues that the autonomy-centred vision of dignity, focusing on equal concern and respect, construes society and religious groups as existing for the facilitation of individual interests. He then points to an alternative vision of dignity, drawn from Christian personalism. Here, persons are understood as a gift, cohering in groups outside the state in pursuit of desirable and even transcendental ends.

What are the implications for practical decision-making of these and other critiques of autonomy-based dignity beyond the debate on freedom of religion? One effect is likely to be that previous justifications based in autonomy may have to be rethought more widely. Sedmak would have us emphasize much more the importance of relationality rather than autonomy in our understanding of dignity. 132 Socio-economic rights would be rethought, for example, as protecting *relational* aspects of human flourishing in order to maximize the recognition and protection of our dignity, rather than as protecting the exercise of autonomy. 133 This is not to say that a relational approach is incapable of coexisting with all understandings of autonomy. A focus on

autonomy does not have to adopt a conception of the individual as ruggedly individualistic. Indeed, one can argue that autonomy often results from the existence of certain kinds of supportive relationships.

Whether consistent with autonomy or not, relationality may be useful in other contexts. For Rivers, for example, underestimating the importance of relationality is central to the weakness of current conceptions of dignity as a legal foundation for freedom of religion. Harrison takes this further, arguing that a personalist understanding of the person as 'gift' points towards a stronger associational account of religious liberty. It might also help us appreciate different ways of reinterpreting famous instances in which dignity is perceived as unduly antagonistic to autonomy interests, where dignity sometimes appears as a restriction on liberty for paternalistic reasons (for example, prohibiting dwarf-throwing). 134 On closer inspection these may appear to be more about restricting the perceived adverse impact of a social practice on *other*  people who belong to a category that is subject to discrimination or low status. The prohibition based on dignity is to protect that larger category, rather than paternalistically trying to tell the individual whose actions are restricted that the society knows best for them.

As we saw earlier, Sedmak adopts an understanding of human dignity as a requirement to treat people as human beings rather than as objects, emphasizing how important the loss ofthe 'interiority of the person' can be. But how central should ideas of subjectivity be to the concept of dignity? To argue that one should pay attention to subjective experience is not necessarily to argue that this is all that matters. When somebody neglects another person, whether it is neglecting their hunger or leaving them naked in a wheelchair outside the bathroom of an old people's home, it is arguable that this is more than simply a failure to respect the 'interiority of the person'. The essence of the concern with dignity, some argue, is the indignity being offered to the human being who is naked or hungry, whether that human being is conscious of the indignity or not. For some, and we see this in Margalit's discussion of humiliation, 135 what dignity does is not just protect people from the experience of a collapse of self-esteem or being ignored but from the actual harm itself. So when an army jeep drags a corpse around the square of a village, wouldn't we consider this as inhuman treatment of the parents and an infringement of

the dignity of the dead man? 136 Shouldn't we also treat with dignity those who have lost consciousness and those with dementia, who possess no interiority?

Does the idea of humiliation come closer to the core sense of what dignity involves, as argued by Margalit? Notice four implications of the move to consider humiliation as a key to understanding dignity. First, we have moved away from the idea that the search for dignity involves trying to understand what it is about humans that involves intrinsic value, towards a different understanding, what some have called 'attributed dignity', where the issue is rather how we regard other people and act towards them. The second implication of a move to humiliation is that we have moved from a positive understanding of dignity towards a negative understanding of dignity: those who support humiliation as the key stress the importance of considering what constitutes indignity, rather than trying to understand what constitutes dignity. The third implication is that concentrating on humiliation involves an expressive conception of indignity. That is to say, we should act towards others not just in ways that are objectively good, in some mechanistic and impartial way, but in ways that are expressive of respect, somewhat similar to the meaning of dignity that Rosen adopts. 137 The fourth implication is that there is a strong emphasis in the humiliation approach of considering what duty requires rather than what rights require.

Several potential problems with this understanding of dignity might be identified. First, if dignity is thought to be the foundation of human rights, humiliation cannot be a comprehensive foundation for rights. If what one is trying to think through is the idea of dignity and its relation to human rights, adopting a humiliation-based understanding quickly demonstrates that all those who say that human rights have a foundation in dignity are mistaken, because one cannot derive all those rights from dignity, understood as humiliation. So if one is trying to make best sense of human rights practice, an alternative understanding of dignity is necessary. 138 Second, we have seen that humiliation involves a duty-based perspective, but this raises the further question of *why* we owe that duty to other human beings. Why do we have a duty not to humiliate them? In particular, do those who believe in attributed dignity have to believe also in some notion of intrinsic dignity in order to identifY to whom the duty not to humiliate is owed? Is it possible to believe in attributed dignity without also accepting intrinsic dignity?

<sup>138</sup> A point made in oral comments by John Tasioulas.

#### 42 *Christopher McCrudden*

So far, we have considered three main ways in which different contributors have sought to capture the idea of human dignity: as the concept we use to describe the intrinsic value of the person, as essentially protecting autonomy, and as that which a person has when not humiliated by others. The fourth principal philosophical understanding of dignity considered in this book is as a protected status or, more accurately perhaps, the attribution of dignity as the expression of moral status. Viewing this understanding as truer to its historical roots, Waldron argues in his recent book that modem understandings of dignity take the intuition that dignity is about status and combine it with modem commitments to equality. 139 In his chapter in this book, Waldron returns to consider how to navigate between an egalitarian idea of human dignity and the idea of *dignitas,* connected with hierarchy, rank, and office. 140 One possible way of bridging the gap between the two, he argues, is to talk of *the dignity of the citizen.* In modem republics and democracies, he suggests, the dignity of the citizen extends to a large sector of the population and connotes something about the general quality of the relation between the government and the governed. Though the dignity of the citizen and human dignity are not the same concept, he argues that they are congruent in many respects; and the former casts considerable light on the latter.

Rosen is sceptical of Waldron's equal status-based conceptions of dignity. Quoting Gilbert and Sullivan's *The Gondoliers* ('When everybody's somebody then nobody's anybody'), he argues that levelling up is often pretty meaningless. For Waldron, however, this criticism misses the mark. 141 We can easily imagine situations where high-ranking people in society have a vote, low-ranking people don't, and then we decide to give the vote to everybody. We decide to treat everybody as having the high rank. Or, to take another example, high-ranking people are punished humanely and allowed to give evidence freely in court, but low-ranking people are punished savagely and give evidence only under torture, and then we decide to confer the high rank on everybody.

It is unclear, however, how far this response deals with Rosen's criticism of Waldron. Adopting an egalitarian, status-based conception of dignity requires a decision as to which of the characteristics of high status are going to be attributed to people when everybody has this high status. Clearly, if those with high status have previously required their dignity to be recognized by having people kowtow to them, then we are unlikely to want to generalize that

<sup>139</sup> Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights.* 

<sup>140</sup> Waldron, Chapter 18, this volume.

<sup>141</sup> Jeremy Waldron, in discussion at the conference.

requirement to everyone. In addition, the idea that we can generalize highstatus privileges may misunderstand the nature of the privilege in question; at least some privileges require there to be inequality. So which aspects of a high status are the ones that are essential to that high status, and therefore part of one's dignity? Finally, equal status is seldom presented as a comprehensive theory of dignity, even by its supporters, and the equal status idea may itself be based on the notion of an inner kernel of value, which is then recognized by according equal status.

# Human dignity and human rights

The philosophical debates frequently touch on the relationship between dignity and human rights, and it is to a more systematic consideration of this relationship that we now tum. What is the added value that dignity might bring to discussion about the foundations of human rights, if, indeed, it has any value at all? The previous paragraphs made certain assumptions that now require further consideration: that there is a foundational vacuum in human rights, and that this is problematic and should be addressed; that human dignity and human rights are connected, and that this relationship may provide a foundation for more specific ethical principles articulated in the form of rights. What should we make of these arguments?

Initially, we need to consider a preliminary, more pragmatic, question. Assuming that there is a significant absence of agreement on the foundations of human rights, and that human rights are generally thought to be 'a good thing', should this absence of agreement be unmasked? On the one hand, one may take the position that, powerful though myths may be, not making clear the foundations of human rights is more likely to undermine the human rights project in the longer term than is exposing the existing uncertainties about what those foundations might be. Not all agree, however, and some appear to adopt a different strategy: that we should just deliberately fool ourselves (and, by implication, others) into believing that there are such foundations of belief; we should call a halt to unmasking and start remasking. 142

A related issue is what standard such foundations would have to meet in order to fulfil the task required of them. Richard Rorty has, in the eyes of some, 143 inflated the idea of what a foundational explanation for human rights

<sup>142</sup> See Gearty, Chapter 8, this volume, in which he raises but then discounts remasking as a tempting but not an effective solution.

<sup>143</sup> John Tasioulas, 'The legal relevance of ethical objectivity', *American Journal of Jurisprudence*  47 (2002), 211.

would require: that it would have to be the sort of explanation which anyone would automatically come to see the truth of if confronted with it; and that it would have to be the sort of explanation which would guarantee the historical success of human rights. 144 For others, talk about foundations simply means that if one believes in human rights as a rational animal, one should have good reasons for one's belief, and one should not have beliefs that one cannot justify. Adopting this less inflated standard may address the dilemma sketched out in the previous paragraph. For those who consider that we should fool ourselves and others into believing that human rights have foundations, the question then is why we would want to do this? We might say to them: you think human rights are a good thing; well then, you must have reasons for that belief, otherwise you will not be able to distinguish yourself from those you are using human rights to criticize; what are those reasons? With that brief excursus, let us return to consider dignity.

Even assuming that discussion about the foundations of human rights is useful, how useful is the concept of human *dignity* in this discussion? Does dignity language supply any additional substantive meaning? For Schlink, in legal contexts, the answer is often not. 145 When specific problems and cases involving alleged violations of human rights are addressed, he cannot see that dignity adds any additional substantive meaning to the unfolding or solving of the case. There may, in his view, be nothing wrong with using the rhetoric of dignity in discussing problem cases, but there is nothing necessarily lost when we just talk about freedom, religious liberty, the right to life, or equality by themselves, without dignity. If we just talk about these specific freedoms or about equality, and do it carefully and comprehensively, then we often don't miss any important aspect of the issue. He recognizes that there are exceptions to this in practice, where dignity is used as a speCific legal concept and judges therefore are required to consider dignity as the principal legal concept in issue, such as in Israel and Germany; but in general he considers that dignity adds no substantive meaning to a legal human rights debate that other concepts cannot supply. Some would go even further in discounting the importance of dignity for conceptions of human rights, seeing dignity as little more than a shorthand way of speaking of human rights collectively, adding nothing substantive.

<sup>144</sup> Richard Rorty, 'Human rights, rationality, and sentimentality', in Stephen Shute and Susan Hurley (eds), *On Human Rights: The Oxford Amnesty Lectures 1993* (New York, Basic Books, 1993). 145 Schlink, Chapter 37, this volume.

Others profoundly disagree. Two broad approaches have proved particularly interesting, one represented by Tasioulas, 146 the other by John Milbank.147 Both argue that there is an important substantive relationship between the concepts of human rights and human dignity, but beyond that their disagreement is profound.

Tasioulas argues, as we have seen earlier, that human dignity is a basic moral status, not a human interest or good. It is a vital ground supporting the idea of human rights, but it cannot be the sole ground of human rights. More specifically, human dignity has to operate in tandem with a rich conception of the elements of human flourishing or basic human goods, including knowledge, friendship, and achievement, among others. How these different elements fit together is not entirely clear, however. Is it the case that Tasioulas sees some particular human rights as grounded in dignity but other rights as founded in knowledge or friendship? If so, which are the rights founded in dignity, and why? Are the rights founded in dignity in some sense more important than others, or more paradigmatic than others?

Tasioulas's position means that he has to steer a middle course between two more extreme alternatives. One alternative is presented by those who say that human dignity is the exclusive basis of human rights: that it is the *only*  value we need to appeal to in order to generate anything like a recognizable list of human rights. The other more extreme position, which Tasioulas also rejects, argues that the project of deriving any human rights from human dignity is unpersuasive. One cannot generate human rights from anything like human dignity, and therefore we should abandon the notion of human dignity entirely; and in particular we should not think of it as something that we necessarily need to appeal to in defending human rights (a position similar to that advocated by Schlink).

By contrast, Milbank suggests a radically different approach to the relationship between human dignity and human rights. He suggests that not only do human rights not derive from human dignity but that dignity and rights are concepts that are in some considerable tension with each other. For Milbank, dignity is something with roots in premodernity, having to do with status and not something derived from a kind of isolated a priori subjective individual, and that dignity is incompatible therefore with any idea of subjective rights. While, in the Middle Ages, more and more rights for subjects are discussed, these are not grounded in subjectivity. His distinction between dignity and rights, between dignity as status and notions of subjective freedom,

<sup>146</sup> Tasioulas, Chapter 16, this volume.

<sup>147</sup> John Milbank, Chapter 10, this volume.

counterposes the two concepts rather than, as with Tasioulas, viewing rights as derived (even partly) from dignity. Milbank's analysis, contrasting rights and dignity, appears to depend, however, on a particular characterization of rights as 'subjective', a characterization that not all rights theorists would accept.

Even if one does not agree with the stronger form of Milbank's claim, that there is a necessary and fundamental conflict between the concept of rights and a concept of dignity, we can see that there is, at least, sometimes an uneasy relationship between those two. 148 Certainly, one cannot move in a facile way from an idea of dignity to the derivation of ideas of rights and vice versa; and dignity may not always necessarily find its best expression and protection in the language of rights. Riordan, for instance, argues that religion and religious liberty can be understood broadly or narrowly, and that the notion of dignity used for the grounding of rights can result in a significant restriction in the understanding ofthe right to religious freedom, even to the point of its elimination as a distinctive right. Dignity may, therefore, cut across rights, and we may ask whether this may not actually be a good thing, keeping human rights concepts from becoming unquestioned, and supplying a possible critique of human rights. Dignity may, indeed, outstrip rights. It may, then, function iii some way as a ground for rights but also a ground for the critique of rights. Thus, for example, those who consider that dignity protects the integrity of the human person may be able to use the concept of dignity to criticize an interpretation of rights that is too cramped to protect that person, or to criticize a claimed extension of rights that seems not to reflect or protect human dignity. So dignity may help to provide a certain kind of critical distance from rights, reducing the tendency to fetishize rights in contemporary society. This does not, however, necessarily undermine the argument that dignity is a (partial, at least) foundation for rights. If dignity is part of the foundation, it can pJ;'clvide a basis for criticism of current interpretations of specific rights.

Clearly, the relationship between human dignity and human rights is intensely related to one's understanding of rights, as the discussion of Milbank illustrates, but also to the conception of dignity that one has. If, for example, one has a conception of indignity that is rooted in the idea of shaming someone or in the closely related idea of humiliation, as we have seen is Margalit's understanding, then it is easy to see that dignity in that sense cannot provide the basis for all human rights. If I steal your car, I trample on your property rights (assuming that property rights are rights) but I do not hurt your dignity, in this sense.

148 This paragraph draws extensively on an oral contribution to the discussion by Paolo Carozza.

All this also has important implications for the extent to which, even if we agree that dignity is a foundation for rights, dignity provides any guide for action. The more general and open-ended one's conception of dignity, the more steps removed we are from being able to specify the contours of rights: rights with what content, whose responsibility it is to accord those rights, what kind of remedy for rights violations is appropriate, and how does the state fit in? Even if we all agreed on the foundations and meaning of human dignity, there would still be a rich difference of understandings about how exactly that principle should be instantiated in specific contexts, with respect to specific persons, and in specific cultures.

### Legal debates

There appear to be two levels in the debates around dignity. One level of debate, the foundational level, concerns the grounding of the concept of dignity in some anthropological, historical, philosophical, theological, or ontological account of what Dellavalle calls the pre-legal,149 or what Habermas calls the life-world. 150 Another level of debate concerns whether, and if so how, dignity provides a guide for action, and this frequently involves the role that dignity plays in the legal sphere: the way in which declarations, conventions, and legislation on rights appeal to dignity. So much is this the case that the concept of dignity itself becomes incorporated within the legal resources on which judges and lawyers draw.

It is the intimate connection between the concept of dignity and legal texts and practices that may appear to reveal the need for the second level of analysis and debate. This distinction is, however, problematic. For heuristic reasons, this introduction has so far distinguished between reasoning of the tYPe carried out by philosophers and theologians from what lawyers and judges do. At one level this distinction is important, and the previous paragraph reflects the fact that there are importantly different institutional contexts in which these different actors reason. But we should not overemphasize the differences. In important respects, law involves foundational moral reasoning of a type that is very similar to that which philosophers and theologians engage in.

<sup>149</sup> Dellavalle, Chapter 25, this volume.

<sup>150</sup> Jiirgen Habermas, *The Theory of Communicative Action,* vol. 2: *Life-World and System: A Critique of Functionalist Reason,* trans. Thomas McCarthy (Boston, MA, Beacon Press, 1987).

This has important implications for our understanding of dignity because many of the moral and ethical issues that philosophers and theologians are concerned to explore are the same as those that judges, for example, will have to grapple with in their use of dignity, and the heuristic device of concentrating on differing disciplinary approaches should not blind us to that. As importantly, to the extent that judges and legal scholars are not only 'doing legal interpretation' but are also, perhaps particularly in this area, also 'doing moral reasoning', their methods and the arguments they engage with contribute to the societal context in which philosophers and theologians also operate. To put the point briefly: legal (and perhaps particularly judicial) interpretation is not only influenced by but also contributes to moral reasoning. 151

As has already been made plain, there are many areas oflegal controversy in which dignity-based arguments arise, ranging from issues of torture, to discrimination, privacy, forced labour, and freedom of religion, thereby demonstrating the breadth of the concept's relevance in legal contexts. Enough has been said to show that there is a considerable number of different conceptions of dignity in the legal context, and that these both overlap and may conflict. Given this, it is not surprising that dignity arguments are often present on both sides of contested legal issues, thus also demonstrating the versatility of dignity 'talk' in the legal as well as in the philosophical and theological contexts. Indeed, where legal interpretation is seen as adopting a particular understanding of dignity, as Rivers argues that judicial decisions do (if only covertly) in freedom of religion cases, this is seen as problematic, and a greater diversity of meaning of dignity is advocated.

Perhaps one of the most contentious legal areas in which dignity has been drawn on concerns abortion. Siegel's account of the political struggles that led to abortion's constitutionalization in Germany and the USA is a useful Â· case study of these aspects of dignity. 152 She indicates that competing conceptions of dignity, what she terms 'dignity as liberty', 'dignity as equality', and 'dignity as life', are useful (if rough) ways of identifying the competing legal claims made by the different actors in these jurisdictions over a significant period of time. Some feminists argued that under then prevailing social arrangements, laws criminalizing abortion violated dignity as liberty, taking away from women control over decisions conceriling their bodily health, sexual relations, family relations, economic independence, and participation in political life, while simultaneously appealing to dignity as equality, viewing

<sup>151</sup> I am grateful to Samantha Besson for making this point.

<sup>152</sup> Siegel, Chapter 30, this volume. Another example is how Tollefsen's dignity of procreative marriage is counterpointed by Cameron's dignity-based argument in favour of same-sex marriage.

laws vesting decision about abortion in doctors' committees as degrading to women, by treating women as the kind of decision-makers who lack moral competence to make decisions. In contrast, those endeavouring to preserve the law criminalizing abortion adopted an apparently different conception of dignity, appealing to dignity as life, emphasizing that life has dignity whether the foetus has gained consciousness or not. This conception of dignity is not concerned with coercion, humiliation, or instrumentalization but rather, through the regulation of birth, sex, and death, with the symbolic reaffirmation of the sacredness of life.

In considering how law deals with these different understandings of dignity, and more generally what role dignity plays in the legal context and in legal scholarship, a preliminary question must be identified. Should the law be primarily concerned with expressing values, or with the practical effect of the law? One of the central issues in the German constitutional debates over abortion that Siegel discusses concerned this issue. Jackson has pointed to the relevance of a recent global review of abortion published in *The Lancet* for considering this issue more widely. 153 Perhaps counter-intuitively, the review suggests that the abortion rate is higher in countries with restrictive abortion laws than it is where the law is more liberal. Why this matters, she suggests, is that the illegality of abortion may not mean that it doesn't happen; it may mean that it happens more frequently and unsafely, resulting not only in the death of the foetus, but also in serious harm or death for the woman.

More broadly, does the context in which dignity is operationalized (political, moral, or legal; legislative or judicial) affect our understanding of the concept? Christoph Moilers argues for an affirmative answer: that when human dignity becomes used as an argument in the *judicial* context, for example, many things change. 154 In particular, the idea that human dignity is something like an incompletely theorized argument, which may well be a highly successful strategy to use in a context where political compromise is necessary (as in an international treaty), becomes highly problematic when we start to apply the concept of dignity to solve a particular legal problem before a court. Because of this, Moilers argues, although human dignity might be a good term to put into preambles, or into general parts of treaties, it is probably not very helpful to include dignity in a legal instrument that is intended to be a regulatory tool, placing dignity on an equal footing with individual rights such as freedom of expression, freedom of religion, or property rights.

<sup>153</sup> Emily Jackson, in discussion at the conference, referring to Gilda Sedgh, Susheela Singh, Iqbal H. Shah, Elisabeth Ahman, Stanley K. Henshaw, and Akinrinola Bankole, 'Induced abortion: incidence and trends worldwide from 1995 to 2008', *The Lancet,* 379:9816 (18 February 2012), 625-32. 154 Christoph Moilers, Chapter 9, this volume.

We do not have to accept Moilers's scepticism, echoing Gearty, of the utility of dignity in adjudication to take his point that the institutional context in which dignity is used matters. This intuition not only seems valid when we contrast the political and legal contexts in which dignity is put, but also when we contrast the differing legal contexts with each other. Barak155 and Dieter Grimm 156 both emphasize these differing contexts in which dignity is used and the necessity of distinguishing between them if the legal use of the term is to be properly appreciated.

Several different legal contexts can be identified. We can distinguish the use of dignity in the context of constitutional drafting as compared with the use of dignity in the ordinary legislative context. We need also to distinguish the use of dignity in the drafting context (whether constitutional or legislative) from appeals to dignity in litigation and adjudication. Finally, in some other legal contexts, such as the European Convention on Human Rights, dignity does not feature in the text at all (the implications of which are explored by Jean-Paul Costa). 157 In these contexts, dignity may function as a value, or principle, or policy deeply instantiated within the legal system, and something to which the legal system has committed itself, and to which actors in the system refer. Quite different uses of dignity might be intended by the different origins of the legal instantiation of dignity in these different contexts. Goos shows, for example, that the different origins of dignity in the German Lander and the German Federal Republic makes a single 'constitutional' understanding of dignity difficult to sustain, even within Germany. 158

Of those contributors who address the legal use of dignity, most discuss its interpretation by judges in the context of constitutional litigation. In this context, as Barak argues, the concept is employed in a constitutional structure that confers on judges a certain discretion to make judgments, fleshing out the constitution. It is useful to identify the major debates that are usually encountered in this context. The first is whether dignity is a right, or a principle, or a value. The second issue is whether dignity embodies a negative or a positive obligation: to what extent is dignity conceptualized as simply a negative right against other persons or the state, and to what extent is it conceptualized as a positive obligation (particularly on the state)? If it is a negative obligation, how narrow is it-just a prohibition on humiliating others, or more? If it is a positive obligation, how broad is it? Reaume considers whether socio-economic rights are generated, for example.

<sup>157</sup> Costa, Chapter 22, this volume.

<sup>158</sup> Goos, Chapter 3, this volume.

Important as these considerations are, however, we will not consider them further here. In fact, two other sets of issues dominate the internal debate in this book: the absolute or qualified nature of dignity, and the relevance of philosophical or theological understandings of dignity in the legal context. It is to these that we now tum.

Is dignity qualified or absolute? Barak asserts that the use of dignity in the Israeli context, where dignity is a right as well as a principle, is qualified rather than absolute, and is of broad application. Grimm addresses the use of dignity mostly in the German context, where dignity is predominantly seen as a principle, absolute and confined (although Rosen queries the extent to which dignity is actually seen in Germany as an absolute right, as opposed to being a source of rights, and queries whether the conception adopted in Germany is in fact a restricted conception of dignity). 159

What are the implications of dignity being interpreted as imposing absolute duties, without exception? Barak identifies one particular consequence: that it is more likely that dignity will have to be defined more narrowly. Where dignity is absolute, the more broadly it is defined, the more the courts will be prevented from balancing competing values. Grimm identifies several additional consequences of treating dignity as absolute. Only one right in a legal system can be absolute, he argues. If we want to have two legal rights both with the quality of being absolute rights, unless both are specified in a very narrow way, for example by imposing only negative duties, it is likely that these two rights will conflict. If the judge has to decide which one prevails in all circumstances, the other is no longer absolute; if hierarchical priority is sometimes given one of these rights but at other times the other right, then neither is absolute.

Several contributors consider the implications somewhat more theoretically. For Dupre there is a third, possibly more attractive, effect of making dignity absolute: that it creates conflicts with other human rights, which requires us to rethink what we understand as the importance of the opposing right-dignity conceived in this way keeps rights continually on their toes, we might say. 16Â° For Beattie, however, making dignity absolute in the legal context has a paradoxical effect. By enacting dignity into law and making it subject to German judicial interpretation, in a specifically German context, she tentatively suggests that this smuggles into German law the right to define not only dignity but also the human according to its terms of inclusion and

<sup>159</sup> Rosen, *Dignity,* at I OOff.

<sup>16</sup>Â° Catherine Dupre in discussion at the conference.

exclusion, 'and thus it cannot avoid reinstating the conditions which made the death camps possible' .161

The major legal effect of creating an absolute right, however, is that proportionality and balancing cannot be used: Barak regards this as a major disadvantage, while Grimm regards it as a major advantage. We can test the implications of the exclusion of balancing through an example. 162 Suppose that the results of the experiments on twins carried out as part of the pseudoscientific research by Mengele in Auschwitz and Birkenau came into your possession. Let us suppose, further, that the results were compiled in an orderly way and that there was useful information that would indisputably benefit others. Should we be allowed to use the information? Or, in the name of human dignity, should its use be prohibited? Or consider whether the use of evidence obtained under torture should be able to be used in court. Do these test the limits of the acceptability of an absolute understanding of dignity?

These hypothetical cases may illustrate a significant difference between the moral and the legal contexts in which dignity is interpreted. There might be reasons for enshrining things as absolute requirements in law, even though in pure moral reasoning we might not have such an absolute requirement. There are important institutional effects in having a more nuanced principle involved, which might make an absolute prohibition more acceptable in a legal context. Suppose that torture evidence was the only way that we could save the actual torture victim from being killed or being subjected to further torture? We might say that it is an absolute *moral* requirement that torture should not be used, but this will strike some as problematic-they would want at least to have a debate about the issue as a matter of morality. But does that necessarily mean that in the *legal* context we should be similarly worried about an absolute prohibition? The notion that a *court* should engage in a balancing exercise with regard, for example, to the use of torture evidence or the use of evidence from evil experimentation may strike some as so fundamentally out of tune with the function of courts as to be properly prohibited whatever the consequences, even though they may recognize that as a *moral*  issue there is room for debate.

There is one further internal debate between the contributors, which arises out of the previous paragraph: to what extent should we regard law and legal interpretation as autonomous systems of reasoning and judgement? We should immediately distinguish, however fuzzily, between the making of law and its interpretation. In a democracy, the domain of politics is where debates

<sup>161</sup> Beattie, Chapter 14, this volume.

<sup>162</sup> Originally suggested by Avishai Margalit at the conference.

about what the law should be primarily take place. Theologians, philosophers, lawyers, and all other kinds of citizens have the possibility of contributing to these political debates, and may indeed have an impact on the content of legislation. The law that judges and lawyers interpret and apply is already shaped by certain influences, therefore, which at times may be philosophical and even theological. How far should judges consider that they should incorporate philosophical or theological understandings, in particular of dignity, into legal interpretation?

This is essentially the same debate that arises whenever the relationship between law and morality is under discussion, and the usual divisions therefore seem to emerge when the normative concept is dignity. For Barak, the judge's role is clearly one of interpreting a legal concept, but one with a heavy moral content, one that can best be approached by understanding the society whose laws the judge is interpreting. Two possible problems arise from this position. First, if legal interpretation is so contextual, does that mean that the legal meaning of dignity is also highly contextualized, and if so, what does this do to the idea of dignity being universal? Second, where does the difference lie between law and political sociology in a context where the judge's role is to understand society, as well as law?

Although Grimm argues that it is necessary for lawyers and judges to have a general intellectual understanding of the concept of dignity in order to apply it, he questions whether philosophical or theological understandings of the term can be used to help elucidate the meaning of dignity in the legal context. He considers that the transfer of dignity from the philosophical and theological to the legal disconnects the notion from its original roots and sources, regarding law as a relatively autonomous system. Within the operation of the legal system only legal arguments count. Extra-legal sources are irrelevant unless and until they are translated into a legal argument, which must fit the legal environment in which the concept is being interpreted. What counts as a legal argument may be contested and it may change over time, but the decision as to what counts can only be taken inside and not outside the legal system itself. For Beattie, this is exactly the problem. 163 'In co-opting the word "dignity"', she argues, 'the law also drains it of any alternative meaning.' In order to legitimate its use of the concept, law must 'empty ... words of all their historical references and ideological inscriptions'.

If the relationship between law and philosophy is problematic for lawyers, it is also problematic for philosophers. There are certain benefits of engaging with lawyers in attempting to understand the nature of dignity. Both Waldron

and Rosen, in remarkably different ways it is true, have identified how their philosophical explorations benefited from exposure to legal debates because lawyers focus on concrete cases, and on issues of decision. 164 The potential disadvantage, as suggested by Tasioulas, 165 is that precisely this focus on the bottom line may lead to a certain kind of impatience, where the only purpose of philosophy is seen as its utility in helping to resolve the difficult practical cases with which lawyers and judges are confronted. For philosophers, no ethical principle by itself resolves a difficult practical issue. It is one thing for the principle to be taken into account, but what resolves the matter is the use of judgement. A purely ethical understanding of human dignity is likely still to need to be supplemented if it is to be workable or operational, and one of the important roles that law performs is to give more specific content to rather vague concepts at the ethical level. The specificity of law works hand in hand with the vagueness of philosophy or moral reasoning, because moral reasoning often needs to be supplemented in this way.

#### Inductive method, consensus, and dialogue

Common to all the disciplines represented in this book is the methodological problem of how we should go about identifYing the meaning and function of dignity. Hollenbach suggests that there are essentially two choices: a deductive approach, in which reasoning works from the more general to the more specific, and (his own preference) an inductive approach in which reasoning works the other way, moving from specific observations to broader generalizations and theories, paying attention to what diverse communities think about how persons should be treated and seeking to determine where agreement may be possible across communities. 166 This involves reasoned reflection on the experience of what it is to be human, and in particular reasoned reflection on what happens when these factors are denied. For Hollenbach, the overlapping consensus that has emerged over the past fifty years at the international level on what human rights require did not happen by accident; there were good reasons for it. This illustrates the use of practical reason to reflect inductively on experience in order to reach consensus on at least some of the most important requirements.

Nor is the issue of what is the appropriate methodology to adopt limited to the philosophical and theological spheres. Reaume, although not explicitly drawing on the concept of practical reason, also eschews proceeding by way of grand theory down to concrete legal cases, and adopts an inductive approach: identifYing the ideas about dignity that are seeping out of the pores of the legal system, when law is called to respond to certain kinds of situations. 167

More generally, one of the themes of Barak's chapter is the methodology courts use to determine what human dignity involves in particular situations. 168 One of the characteristic methods identified in Barak's chapter and reflected in the practice of courts around the world, is that in discussions of what dignity requires courts sometimes look at what courts in other jurisdictions are doing. There has been much discussion of what exactly the function of comparison and the use of comparative law is in this context. One of the answers might be that the function of comparison in the human dignity area, where courts look at what other courts are doing, is that they might be engaging in 'practical reasoning', leading to a consensus that emerges out of contestation.

Hollenbach, it should be noted, combines two methodological elements. First, as has been mentioned, he favours an inductive rather than a deductive approach, but in addition he attempts to use this inductive method to identifY where there appears to be a consensus, and then wants to rely on that consensus as a basis for arguing that this provides grounds for generating a normative obligation to further that consensus. It is thus a somewhat similar method to that adopted by courts when drawing on the experience of other courts. It is also similar to approaches that have sought to find ways of resolving fundamental political disputes by searching for an 'overlapping consensus' among the disputing parties.

This idea of an 'overlapping consensus', most clearly identified with John Rawls, has come in for convincing criticism, much of which need not detain us here. In so far as the second element of Hollenbach's strategy does share a family resemblance with Rawls, it is subject to similar criticisms, particularly if one sees consensus as fully formed and not open to further development or refinement. Why would a given consensus be seen as a powerful basis for deciding what dignity requires, given that there may be a sexist consensus or a homophobic consensus, and we would not think that this should generate the norms required by dignity? But if we say we should only take into account 'enlightened' opinion, is that assuming the very concept we are seeking to

identifY? Or if, as Hollenbach suggests, practical reason can lead to historical development, the consensus may itself be a developing reality.

Carozza also addresses the methodological question, and indeed sees it as central to the debate about dignity. 169 Unlike Hollenbach, he is sceptical of a consensus approach in the sense identified. Although he considers that the practical or overlapping consensus methods that Maritain advocated in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights were highly successful in many ways, he queries whether we can follow the same path today, relying on a practical consensus around dignity to achieve similarly positive results. Constructing the human rights project solely on the grounds of a practical overlapping consensus, he argues, has contributed to several serious problems over the past six decades: problems of institutional weakness, problems of non-compliance, problems of ideological capture, the masking of fundamental differences, and heavy bureaucratization and proceduralization. All these, he believes, are in one way or another related to the original structure of the discourse. The relatively recent resort to human dignity is in part a consequence of the limits of the human rights project itself, where the disagreement we have had since its origin is now pushed back onto the question of human dignity. So we cannot, he argues, rely on a practical consensus as our method of resolving the meaning of human dignity, because we have already learned that this method is unstable and unsustainable.

Is there a way forward? Langan distinguishes between two different ways of understanding the inductive approach: where inductive reasoning is used to identifY consensus, and where it is used to generate respectful dialogue. 170 His understanding is that in much contemporary discussion in this area the latter is the preferable position to adopt. What he advocates is a dialogical view of reasoning, in which learning from other individuals, learning from other communities, and other traditions is an important part of the process, not necessarily for the purpose of generating agreement (indeed, honest dialogue may well lead to a sharper sense of the points of disagreement), but in order to be able to state the position of the other side without offering a travesty, and thereby to lead to higher levels of mutual respect and the increased possibility of dialogue.

Carozza's approach, and Hollenbach's as well, seem relatively similar to such a dialogic approach. We can rely on a strategy of practical consensus, Carozza argues, if we understand that in the original human rights project its use was not meant to be an end point but was intended instead to be the

starting point for a reasoned reflection and dialogue about the requirements of justice and the protection of the human. Carozza suggests that we need to engage now in a more fundamental reflection on human experience that goes to the origin of our understanding of our own humanity. For Carozza, dignity discourse invites openness to the posing of the question of what it is to be human in our public and communal discourse. Such a dialogue is all the more important because, as we have noted, some consider that there is something irreducible about the human person that cannot be fully captured (Sedmak and others, as we have seen, use the word 'mystery'). This means that there is always going to be a need for discussion, the likelihood of disagreement, and a certain under-determination. The very nature of what we are talking aboutthe human person-means that we should never presume to be able to specify dignity beyond contestation.

#### Conversations and dialogue

The purpose of the conference, and of this book, is to engage in exactly this dialogue about human dignity, and to stimulate further productive discussion about human dignity and about what it means to be human. What has emerged from the course of this set of introductory remarks? There are at least three conversations identifiable in the book, and this introduction has identified these different strands and pinpointed the particular issues that arise within, as well as the ways in which the discussion crosses, these strands. One conversation is within and between the different disciplines represented, between lawyers and lawyers, for example, and between philosophers and theologians. The second conversation is that between the secular and the religious understandings of human rights and human dignity. The third conversation is a serious debate within Catholicism, one that has importance for the other two conversations as well.

The group brought together in this book is distinctly multidisciplinary, but does the dialogue go beyond multidisciplinarity? What, indeed, is the purpose of bringing these different disciplines together? Gerald Neuman argues that the advantages of dialogue across disciplines concerning human dignity should not distract us from the reality that different intellectual disciplines have different discourses and methods. 171 Philosophical and religious traditions can contribute insights to debates within the legal discourses (and vice

<sup>171</sup> Gerald L. Neuman, Chapter 38, this volume.

versa, I suggest), but those insights need to be translated into terms that are accessible to outsiders to those traditions.

Alexandra Kemmerer distinguishes several different types of engagement involving different disciplines. 172 Adopting the terminology she suggests, we can say that the purpose of this book is not to engage in an interdisciplinary approach; the aim is not, in other words, to seek some sort of shared position about human dignity among secular and religious people, lawyers, and philosophers. Agreeing with Kemmerer, the aim of the book is more in the nature of a trans-disciplinary engagement, in which the aim ofthe dialogue between the different disciplines is to generate a process of transcending, transgressing, and transforming, rather than integrating, blending, or hybridizing.

This introduction has sought to sketch the contours of each set of debates, and how they interrelate with each other, but it is a reasonable question to ask whether these dialogues are successful. It may be useful, finally, to consider some criteria for what would constitute 'success', if only for the future. For a real dialogue to be successful, at least three conditions seem to be vital. First, a dialogue will only take place if those in dialogue come to the conversation with sufficient confidence in their own positions to be able to open up to others. Second, since a dialogue is a conversation that involves differing positions, with which comes the tendency to regard the other as hostile, for a dialogue to be successful, those taking part need to recognize that there may nevertheless be some value in what the other is saying. Third, those in dialogue have to be prepared to question their own starting points; we can't simply assume the correctness of our deepest beliefs, but have to be open to the possibility that we are wrong. Readers will form their own view on whether any or all of these criteria have been met in what follows. In my view, these conditions were largely met, and the resulting book attempts to reflect the richness of the dialogue that resulted.
