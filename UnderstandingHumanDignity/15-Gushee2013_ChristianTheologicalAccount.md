# **A Christian Theological Account of Human Worth**

## *David P. Gushee1*

## Introduction

Tms CHAPTER TAKES THE somewhat contrarian perspective that the concept of 'human dignity' is a half-secularized remnant of an earlier Jewish and Christian concept best labelled as *the sacred worth of the human person in the sight of God,* or more simply, the sacredness of human life. I will invest the majority of these pages in excavating the original biblical sources, in part so that the memory of them is not altogether lost, and in part to make a peculiarly Protestant and revelational contribution to the contemporary conversation centring on the term 'human dignity'.

# On the language of sacredness

It is not uncommon even today to hear Jews and Christians and sometimes others claim that 'human life is sacred' or speak of 'the sanctity of human life'. Common usage of these phrases reveals both high passion and limited cognition. It seems reasonable as a first step to seek a deeper understanding of what might once have been meant, or might still be meant, when such terms are used.

The *Oxford English Dictionary* (OED) offers the following definitions for 'sanctity':

- 1. holiness of life, saintliness
- 2. the quality ofbeing sacred or hallowed; sacredness, claim to (religious) reverence; inviolability. 2

*Proceedings of the British Academy,* 192, 275-288. ©The British Academy 2013.

<sup>1</sup> Much of the material in the chapter overlaps with and was drawn from my new book *The Sacredness of Human Life* (Grand Rapids, MI, Eerdmans, 2013).

<sup>2</sup> *The Oxford English Dictionary,* 2nd edn (Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1989), 441-2.

But the OED's more extensive definition of the word 'sacred' yields a striking discovery. This English adjective actually emerges from an obsolete verb, *sacre,* which meant to consecrate, sacrifice, make holy; to dedicate (a person) to a deity, to make a class of things sacred to a deity. 3 The adjective 'sacred', derived from sacre, carries forward this range of meanings. A sacred thing is an object or being that someone (or Someone) has *made sacred,* for example, dedicated, consecrated, venerated. The adjective (sacred) now assumes the action of the lost verb (sacre), but because we have lost the verb it is easy to lose a sense of *agency-of* who (if anyone) bears responsibility for having consecrated or *made sacred.* 

*Sanctity* carries a particular *moral* connotation-such as purity, holiness, or virtue-subtly linking the term to character qualities *achieved by the person* who has attained sanctity. *Sacredness,* by contrast, clearly reflects an *ascribed status,* referring to something or someone having received a special status through consecration by another. Sacredness is the more apt term in getting at what the biblical traditions have sought to say about human worth.

My explorations of a variety of cases in which an object, place, or person has been ascribed sacred status reveals a pattern I call the *sacredness paradigm.* It is not inextricably tied to belief in God, though most often in history it has been religiously motivated and rooted. It goes something like this:

- 1. One from among a class of ordinary things (we will call it X from among a large group ofx's) is lifted up from the midst of its ordinary companions and designated as of elevated rank or special status;
- 2. The consecration, hallowing, or sacralizing of this now-sacred X is undertaken by some agency, whether collective or individual, human or divine, whose authority to make such a designation is accepted by the community affected;
- 3. A variety of reasons can exist for why this particular X is declared sacred, but for those making and acknowledging the designation the reasons are compelling;
- 4. This speciaVsacred status evokes in relation to X an attitude or posture of awe, veneration, or reverence;
- 5. This attitudinal posture is (expected to be) accompanied by concrete moral obligations within the community to treat X with due respect and even special care, and in particular to prevent any *desecration* of X;

3 *OED,* 338-9.

- 6. This moral obligation to preserve what is often called the 'inviolability' of the sacred X is normally accompanied by negative sanctions for those who do violate the sacred.
When religious people today use the phrase 'sacredness of human life' they are not saying that some class of human beings is sacred and to be viewed and treated as in steps 1-6 above. They are instead saying that *each and every human life* is thus designated. Every human being x is to be set apart as a sacred X, and this by divine command.

This move conforms to the sacredness paradigm above, while departing from it in one crucial way. It conforms because those who make a claim that every human being is sacred intend something like the six steps I have identified in the sacredness paradigm. The only difference is in the first step. No longer is *one* from among a class of ordinary things lifted up above the others and designated as sacred. Now each and every member of the class *human being* is thus elevated. The great innovation in Jewish and Christian thought was *not at all* the ascription of sacred worth to some class or category of human beings. This was already common in ancient civilization, usually with reference to the royal classes. What was new (and revelatory) was the way the sacred texts of Judaism and Christianity bore witness to the divine ascription of such sacred worth to *all human beings.* Visible in their sacred texts and apparent (sometimes il) glimpses) in the practice of these biblical religions was a sacredness-of-human-life ethic that is carried forward today among some of the practitioners of these biblical faiths.

In view of the sacredness paradigm, I define the still-extant Christian sacredness-of-human-life theology/ethic as follows:

> To say that each human life (or human life, as such) is sacred, is to claim that God has consecrated each and every human being--without exception and in all circumstances-as a unique, incalculably precious being of elevated status and dignity. Through God's revelation in Scripture and Incarnation in Jesus • Christ, God has declared and demonstrated the sacred worth of human beings and will hold all human beings accountable for responding appropriately. Such a response begins by adopting a posture of reverence and by accepting responsibility for the sacred gift that is a human life. It includes offering due respect and care to each human being that we encounter. It extends to an obligation to protect human life from wanton destruction, desecration, or the violation of human rights. A full embrace of the sacredness of human life leads to a full-hearted commitment to foster human flourishing.

And I claim that while there may be a variety of paths to developing such an exalted view of the worth and proper treatment of the human being, the source of such a theology and ethic (in Western civilization, at least) can be traced to the sacred texts of Judaism and Christianity, and the religious traditions which produced and were nurtured by them.

# Biblical foundations

The sacred scriptures ofthe Hebrew Bible and New Testament have for millennia borne witness to (belief in) the God-given sacredness of each human life. This is not to say that this witness is unequivocal, or that countervailing elements cannot be found in sacred scripture. Here, of course, a Christian theology of divine revelation and scriptural authority is relevant, though any kind of extensive articulation of such a theology goes beyond the scope of this chapter. Suffice it to say that I believe the Bible contains traces of what God communicated to Israel, the church, and humanity, as well as plenty of evidence of that divine communication being heard and misheard, obeyed and disobeyed. I believe biblical traces of the sacredness-of-life norm represent divine revelation well heard and sometimes well obeyed, and that it is therefore appropriate to test biblical and post-biblical texts and traditions by the criteria established by this ethical norm.

The Hebrew Bible offers at least four bodies of material that bear witness to a sacredness-of-life ethic: (1) its creation theology; (2) its depiction of God's compassionate care for human beings, especially suffering people; (3) its covenantal/legal materials; and ( 4) its prophetic vision of a just wholeness for Israel and all creation. Ultimately, the conviction that human life is sacred receives its firmest grounding in the Bible's revelation of the character, activity, and decision of God, which lies at the root of all its prescriptions related to how human beings should be perceived and treated. Let me elaborate briefly here on a few key elements of each of these four bodies of material.

#### **God as creator of humanity**

Most Christian declarations about life's sacredness begin with the claim that human life is sacred because it was created in God's image. Genesis 1-2 tells us that humans do not come from nowhere but are the creative handiwork of God. This claim by itself elevates human worth.

Further, God is *equally* the Creator of *all* humans. All references to humanity in Genesis 1 are references to all humanity, and the blessings and tasks given to human beings are given to all. There is one God who makes one humanity. This is a pivotal element of biblical creation theology, and it contributes at least an implicit primal human *equality* and unity.

The creation narrative found in Genesis 2, believed by biblical scholars to be the older account, adds another important element. It tells a story in which God begins to create humanity by creating a first man. The first woman is then formed out of the first man. From these first parents come absolutely everyone else. In this sense we are all kin, all part of one vast human family. Genesis 2 thus teaches a *primal human kinship, unity and equality* by narrating a story in which all human beings come from one common ancestor, or couple. These claims help equalize human status and teach us to value human beings far beyond those most closely connected to us.

The claim that human beings are made in the 'image (and likeness) of God' (Gen. 1:26-7) has perhaps attracted a disproportionate amount oftheological-ethical attention. It is an important claim, to be sure, but its intended original meaning is uncertain and cannot always bear the theological-ethical weight that it has been asked to bear. With trepidation, I accept the conclusion that the biblical writer probably did intend for 'image of God' to signal some kind of resemblance between God and humans. This resemblance may include recognition of human intellectual, spiritual, and/or moral capacities over and against what were presumed to be the lower capacities of the nonhuman animals.

But a 'capacities' rendering of the divine image has proven vulnerable, and not just to the problem of setting up a persistent humans-over-animals dichotomy. Its vulnerability has resurfaced whenever claims about the supposed intellectual, spiritual, or moral incapacity of individuals or groups have been made. These issues have proved to be deeply problematic both in terms of various kinds of historic ethnocentrisms as well as in relation to contemporary bioethical concerns. This is one reason why it is probably better today to understand the image of God as having to do with our exalted *responsibilities*  rather than capacities-humans 'image' God to one another and to the rest of creation through our representation of God's royal rule on earth. This seems a natural inference from the text of Genesis 1 itself, given the direct connection between the declaration of the image of God in humanity and the command to exercise dominion over the creatures.4 The latter is a kind of royal function, with the significance here that *all* human beings, not just kings and queens, carry this kind of 'royal' authority on earth.

#### **God as sustainer, rescuer, and liberator**

The Hebrew Bible teaches that God sustains, cares for, rescues, and acts to liberate human beings made in the divine image. Despite our ascribed grandeur we are physically vulnerable creatures, subject to great misery and suffering. The Bible records that God's universal sustaining care for creation, including humanity (e.g., Gen. 9: 8-17) took a more focused form in God's compassionate response to the suffering of God's people Israel when they were enslaved and threatened with the mass murder of their children in Egypt (Ex. 1-19). The numerous biblical examples of God's care for needy and suffering human beings have impressed themselves deeply on the consciousness of peoples and cultures affected by the biblical witness.

It is hard to overstate the significance of the Exodus narrative in particular. For the Jewish people, this founding narrative of God's compassionate deliverance has been fundamental. Its echoes resound through later biblical writings and in every generation of Jewish life. 'You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt and the Lord your God redeemed you' (Dt. 15:15). This memory instructs Israel as to the character of her God: one who keeps covenant promises, one who looks with compassionate love on Israel, and one who delivers Israel when it appears that all is lost. God is a God of justice who fights for Israel's liberation when she is victimized. This foundational understanding of God's character also demands oflsrael that her way of life as a people reflects responsive covenant fidelity, compassionate love, and justice, central themes in both the law and the prophets. This Exodus-shaped vision has been embraced by many suffering peoples in human history. Michael Walzer has shown the endless fecundity of the Exodus texts for inspiring social revolutions in the name ofjustice.5

#### **God as lawmaker and judge**

The biblical narrative moves from Exodus to Sinai, from God's miraculous deliverance of the covenant people to God's articulation of the laws that shall govern Israel. It is highly significant that God is depicted as the ultimate source of law in Israel, and God holds this covenant people accountable for obedience. If God is the source of law-cultic, civil, criminal, social welfare, moral, all these dimensions flow together here-then the full weight of God's sovereign majesty and power falls upon the laws thus offered. The law therefore carries a great holiness and authority.

5 Michael Walzer, *Exodus and Revolution* (New York, Basic Books, 1985).

The very idea that there is a divinely given moral law that governs Israel-and more than Israel-is itself a major contribution to a sacrednessof-life ethic. It means that God sets the terms for how human beings must relate to both the Divine Person and human persons. Human moral obligation is ultimately rooted in God's will.6 'The foundation for all morality ... is the character and will of God [who] is supreme and without any competitors ... there will be no higher standard of obligation. ' 7 Such an ethic is thus starkly differentiated from any ethic based merely on personal preference, social power, unaided human reason, or communal tradition. God's revealed will establishes a transcendent reference point by which all life is to be governed and by which all human laws and actions can be evaluated and critiqued.

This elevation of a transcendent legal/moral standard over human life creates or reinforces momentum towards human equality before the law. In many cultures, especially in the ancient world, the ruler defined the law and was above the law. But the kings of Israel were accountable to the same divinely given moral law that governed everyone else. David Pleins has written, 'We ... see in these formulations of the Ten Commandments the makings of a subtle critique of monarchy and an attempt to limit its powers . . . [here] each and every member of the community has a religious, moral and social duty toward the nation's deity. ' 8 The many kings who were tempted to forget that their will was not absolute in Israel often ended up paying a serious price for their pride and disobedience. The only context in which that could happen was in a society that believed in divinely given moral law and the accountability of all to God's law, with a socially acknowledged role for prophets who could demand compliance in God's name.

The power of law to level the playing field in human life has the effect of weakening the strong and strengthening the weak. The standard is clear: all stand equal before the law and before those human courts charged with enforcing it. If any member of a particular political community is understood to have moral and legal rights, all have such rights.9 One way that we come to know that all human beings, of all classes and races, are to be perceived as sacred and treated with respect is because we see it happen in the administration

of the law-if the law is functioning properly. In Israel, where law was seen as divinely given, a failure to administer justice in this way was treated as a direct affront to the God who authored the law.

Certainly Old Testament law had gaps and problems. But the texts contain striking elements, especially in Ancient Near Eastern context, that move in the direction of the comprehensive valuing ofhuman life. Even today, even in societies that long ago abandoned a theocratic understanding of governance or of law, biblical law has left its impact on the construction of societies valuing the rule of law and attempting to include every citizen as an equal before the law.

#### **God as the deliverer who brings shalom at last**

One of the Old Testament's key resources for a sacredness of life ethic is found in the demand, and the yearning, for a transformed world of justice and peace. The concept of shalom names that state of affairs in which human beings flourish in community and the sacredness of each and every human life is finally honoured. It means an end to our 'division, hostility, fear, drivenness, and misery'. 10 The Hebrew prophets (our key source for the shalom vision) both demand shalom *now* and yearn for it *then,* when the time comes that God finally prevails.

Ethicist Karen Lebacqz has argued that an ethic of justice is often developed most profoundly amid the experience of a particular injustice. 11 Likewise, the prophetic yearning for shalom begins with the particular, especially Israel's experiences of wrenching violence and injustice. Prophets speak about shalom for Israel from within the cataclysm of war (e.g., Jer. 33). From exile, they speak of the land and people of Israel coming back from the dead (Ezek. 36-7), in a kind of 'new exodus' _12 They yearn for a New Jerusalem, from within the experience of Jerusalem's destruction (e.g., Isa. 65). The prophetic writings left a legacy both of particularity and universality-they speak to specific events, injustices, and dreams of the Jewish people while also still having the moral power to evoke demands and yearnings on the part of millions of people for the kind of world that they envision.

The narrowest translation for the Hebrew word shalom is 'peace', as in the opposite of war, and peace as commonly understood is certainly an

ingredient of it. The prophets demand peace from the covenant people Israel when they decry Israel's violence and murder (Micah 7:2-3), and her turn to military alliances and military might (e.g., Isa. 31:1, Hos. 1:7; Micah 5:10)_13 They yearn for peace as an end to war when they envision a time when 'there shall be endless peace' (Isa. 9:7) and 'they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into pruning hooks' (Mic. 4:3; also Zech. 9:9-1 0). Shalom means peace, as in straightforward security from physical threats to bodies, homes, and communities. God promises just such a 'covenant of peace' (Ezek. 34:25; Isa. 65:25; Num. 25:12). 'Violence shall no more be heard in your land, devastation and destruction within your borders' (Isa. 60: 18). Security is so complete that 'your gates shall always be open; day and night they shall not be shut' (Isa. 60:11 ). Eventually, shalom in this sense is so complete that God 'will destroy on this mountain the shroud that is cast over all peoples ... he will swallow up death forever' (Isa. 25:7). Shalom, as Irving Greenberg has put it, means 'the triumph of life' and 'the overcoming of death'. This is the mission of God in the world and, in Greenberg's view, remains the task ofboth Judaism and Christianity. 14

In summary, the Hebrew Bible bears witness to a divinely declared elevation of the grandeur and worth of each human life, while also containing numerous exhortations to a corresponding moral behaviour on the part of humanity, and especially the covenant people Israel. Such elevated status and appropriate respect are not merited by something good or inherently valuable about humanity. There is no talk of something like intrinsic human dignity. Human life is valuable because God values it, and God's valuing is clear as God creates, sustains, liberates, governs, delivers and redeems, even in the face of human defiance and disobedience. Human life must be treated with respect because God requires it, and because it is the only proper response to the revealed will of God.

The New Testament builds upon and extends these themes from the Hebrew Bible, through its focus on the earthly ministry of Jesus Christ, on the implications of his Incarnation, and on the way of life of the community of faith gathered in his name.

# The earthly ministry of Jesus Christ

The strands of text and tradition cited in the last section flow forward into this one because Jesus was a faithful son oflsrael and a creative expositor of Israel's best traditions. Jesus carried forward in profound ways all four themes noted above. He articulated a creation theology affirming God as Creator and God's sustaining care for human beings, while employing his power over creation to manifest that care in healing, rescuing, and raising people from the dead. He taught and exemplified the compassionate deliverance for suffering people that God had exhibited to Israel, and he offered such deliverance through suffering love rather than violence. He offered a rendering of Jewish legal and ethical norms that affirmed and heightened the protections offered there to human life. And he both articulated and embodied the prophetic vision of an eschatological shalom in God's coming future.

Jesus elevated the sacredness oflife through his resolute rejection of violence and his teaching of the way of peacemaking. Jesus rejected the sad and terrible cycle of human violence in a context of Jewish subjugation under the Roman boot that offered daily incitement to violent resistance; The early church became convinced that such violence did not fit a community seeking to imitate and obey Jesus, and for centuries became known for its rejection of violence.

A key element of the sacredness of life is its expansive inclusiveness. Every life counts; every individual is welcomed; no groups are diminished vis-a-vis other groups; no categories of people are privileged over others. Jesus embodied that inclusiveness throughout his ministry. His example pushed Christians towards the development oflove for 'each and every' human being, without exception, as a fundamental element of a Christ-following way of life. Numerous examples could be cited of his expansive embrace and valuing of the marginalized ones of his own context: women, the sick, the disabled, children, the poor, Samaritans, Roman soldiers, and so on. The early church became known for the radical expansiveness of its community and its hospitality.

Jesus also taught about a God of radical forgiveness and love. Acutely clear about human rebellion against God, even so Jesus declared that God loves each and every person. He spoke about how God loves not just those who love the Father but those who are his enemies (e.g., Mt. 5:43-8), calling any who would claim to be God's children to love enemies in the same manner.

Jesus said that God pays attention even to the life of a sparrow, and all the more attends to providing for our material needs-therefore freeing us to trust God and serve others (Matt. 6:26). He describes God as like a loving Father who can be counted on to 'give good gifts to his children', which authorizes and encourages us to ask for what we need and trust that it will be given to us (Matt. 7:7-11; Lk. 11:13, 18:1-8). He said that God is like a shepherd who goes after the one lost sheep even if he has the ninety-nine at hand (Luke 15:3-7).

Jesus frequently offered reminders of God's special care for those who especially need it-the children, the poor, the abandoned, the sick, the hungry. These reminders were often accompanied by teachings requiring all who would be his followers to imitate this preferential love or face judgment for failing to do so (e.g., Matt. 25:31--46). Love attends especially to those who need love the most, and God will hold us accountable for doing so.

John's Gospel has either Jesus or the narrator sum up this theme in words memorized by many thousands of Christians: 'For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life' (Jn. 3: 16). The bottom line of the New Testament is this divine saving love for the world; for humans; for each and every human. This is the ultimate foundation of Christian belief in the sacredness of human life. In its origins, all Christian claims about 'life's sacredness' or 'human dignity' are in fact theological claims that *for God's sake, and in obedience to God, we must prize and protect the life of human beings.* 

#### **The meaning ofthe Incarnation of Jesus Christ**

Christianity's theologians, beginning in the pages of the New Testament, have seen significance for human worth not just in the ministry of Jesus Christ but in the very fact of Jesus Christ. They have pondered the implications of Godbecoming-human in Jesus, his terrible, atoning death, his resurrection, and his asceils10n.

Christian theologians have often been moved to proclaim that if God became human in Jesus, the status of the human changes. No hW:nan can be seen as worthless. No human life can be treated cruelly or destroyed capriciously. Human dignity can never again be rejected, or confined to only a few groups or individuals of supposedly higher rank. The Incarnation elevates the status of every human being everywhere on the planet at any time in human history. It elevates the worth of every human being at every stage of their lives, because the arc of Jesus's own life included every stage of existence, from conception to death and even resurrection, which is our own destiny in Christ.

God not only took flesh in Jesus Christ, God sacrificed that flesh at Golgotha. This staggering New Testament claim deepens belief in the extent of God's love and care for humanity. God stopped at nothing to reach out to humanity. The intensity of this conviction is deepened when Christians emphasize that Christ died for *each and every human,* friend and foe, good and evil. Belief in the sacredness of life is deepened considerably by reflection on the ultimate nature of the price God paid at the Cross. The incalculably terrible suffering and death of Jesus Christ, and what it says about how very much God values each and every human being, has contributed profoundly to a Christian moral tradition that exalts the immeasurable worth of the human being.

The resurrection of Christ signifies the victory of God over evil, including the evil that took Jesus to the Cross. In the Resurrection, God triumphs, and God signals that in the end he will triumph over Satan and all forces that bring suffering and death; even death itself is destroyed ( 1 Cor. 15 :25). 15 The sacredness oflife, when fully realized, will be part of this ultimate victory of God over the evil that has harmed and destroyed human lives. In the Incarnation, the One through whom all things were made, the one who sustains and holds together the creation itself, became flesh, took on human life. At the Cross this human being suffered and lost his life, for us. But in the Resurrection, Jesus lives again; God wins; and therefore life wins. God is for life. 16

The historic confession of the Church is not just that Jesus rose from the dead but that he ascended to heaven, where he now sits at the right hand of the Father, and from which he shall come to judge the living and the dead. Remembering that the Jesus who rose from the dead was fully God and fully human, this means, as Karl Barth puts it, 'The real mystery of Easter is not that God is glorified in it, but that man is exalted, raised to the right hand of God and permitted to triumph over sin, death and the devil.' 17 God stoops low so that humanity can be exalted even to the right hand of God. Human beings must be viewed and treated as those whose divinely intended destiny is to dwell eternally along with Jesus the Son in the presence of God the Father. Humanity was made for an eternal destiny; this theme is often sounded in Christian declarations on the sacredness of human life.

- 15 I first encountered this formulation in J. Christiaan Beker, *Paul the Apostle: The Triumph of God in Life and Thought* (Philadelphia, PA, Fortress Press, 1980). Since then it has become a familiar concept, linked to the kingdom of God.
<sup>16</sup> This theme has perhaps never been expressed more profoundly than by Pope John Paul II, in *The Gospel of Life* (New York, Times Books, 1995), chapter 2.

<sup>17</sup> Karl Barth, *Dogmatics in Outline* (New York, Harper & Row, 1959), 115.

#### **The ministry of the** early **church**

What ultimately emerged in early Christianity were congregations gathered around this Jesus Christ, believing that in their own early experience of transformed human relations lay the beginnings of the redemption of the world. Christ came, died, and rose again. The world at large remained in the grip of dark forces, of principalities and powers, and evidenced evil at every turn; and yet in Christian churches new seedlings of eschatological community could be found-and must be protected. Here rich and poor, young and old, male and female, Jew and Greek, slave and free, celebrated God's transforming love in Jesus Christ. And before this love all stood equally needy, equally blessed, and equally grateful. Until Christ returned, these communities would seek to live in love towards one another and to all. Instructed to avoid all forms of malice and ill-will to anyone, Christians would instead seek and contribute only good to their neighbours-beginning with their near neighbours in Christian community but extending far beyond 'the household of faith'. They would do so until Christ returned, the hope of which was often invoked as ground and motive for their extraordinary way of life.

# From sacredness of life to human dignity

The scriptures of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament, and the Jewish and Christian theological traditions reflected and rooted therein, offer what can only be described as 'thick', particularistic theological accounts of human worth. Faith communities immersed in these sacred texts were the bearers over many centuries of a profound sacredness-of-human-life theological-ethical tradition that deeply shaped every culture in which Judaism and Christianity lefLa deep mark.

Eventually, however, the cultural imprint of these thick religious traditions began to fade or to be explicitly rejected, first in Europe and eventually beyond. One major reason they faded is because Christians, in particular, radically failed to live out their own ethical vision. Christianity's moral vision became compromised by its partnership with political power and its tragi.c participation in injustice and violence both in Europe and wherever EUropeans went. One could hardly begin to name all of these moral failures, but one especially poignant place to start is with the long, terrible record of Christian anti-Semitism. Amid this and so many other terrible moral failures, the credibility of Christianity was badly damaged, and its powerful leading role in European civilization was rejected both politically and intellectually.

#### 288 *David P Gushee*

The story of secularization is a complex and disputed one, and there were many reasons why Christian intellectual influence faded in the West. But my own explorations lead me to a couple of very basic conclusions relevant to this subject. One is that Western philosophers and moralists remained deeply affected by the Christian theological-ethical substrate of Western culture even when they sought mightily to shift the foundation of epistemological and moral claims to reason rather than revelation. Thus, at least until well into the nineteenth century, Europe's leading moralists retained an articulation of human worth that was still elevated and profound. But they did so while shearing that ethic from its original theological foundation. Thus, there was still such a thing as exalted human worth, now often labelled as human dignity. But it was dignity, not sacredness, and it was grounded in reason, not revelation.

Eventually, more radical thinkers, such as Friedrich Nietzsche, rejected not only the theological *foundation* of 'human dignity' in divine revelation, but *the moral claims themselves.* The moral vision he substituted for the ethic represented by a term like human dignity was, in my view, a quite disastrous one. And he was not the only one who took such a path. The path taken by Nietzsche and his enthusiasts does raise the question of whether, in the erid, the ethic of human dignity is secure apart from its original theological foundations. Certainly Nietzsche believed that the ethic could not survive without its theological underpinnings, and he was more than happy to bury both.

I am persuaded that *human dignity* as deployed in ethical discourse today remains a relatively thin secularization of an originally thick, theocentric claim about *sacred human worth,* the reasons it should be recognized, and the moral obligations that attend such recognition. Human dignity has the great value of being a useful crossover term functioning as a kind of secular cognate to sacredness of human life. By now it has its own formidable intellectual history yielding considerable good fruit in philosophy, law, and culture. It has the perhaps indispensable virtue in a globalized world of being able to bridge diverse religious, political, legal, and intellectual communities. But human dignity cannot fully convey the depth of theological meaning carried by the earlier religious language of human life's God-declared sacredness. It does not fully capture the central convictions of the Christian tradition when it comes to human worth. The best contemporary contribution of the Christian tradition to this discussion of human dignity, then, may well be to retrieve the richest possible exposition of the sacredness-of-human-life vision which preceded it and quietly continues to underwrite it today.-
