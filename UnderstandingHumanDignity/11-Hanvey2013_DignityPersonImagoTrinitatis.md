# **Dignity, Person, and** *Imago Trinitatis*

#### *James Hanvey*

THEOLOGICAL REFLECTION comes to the theme of dignity with a long, complex, and rich tradition ofunderstanding. 1 Theology can never be a purely speculative science; it is always ordered to the historical existence and witness of the Church. For this reason, tradition is as much about change and development as it is about continuity and conservation. This can be seen in the way in which the understanding of human dignity has been even more explicitly part of the Church's teaching through the cultural changes of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, especially the atrocities which mark the latter and still continue.

In this chapter, I wish to explore key aspects of theological discourse on dignity as it occurs in the Catholic tradition. While acknowledging that in a book chapter this must be indicative rather than exhaustive, my hope is that it will help to illuminate the Catholic understanding of dignity and hence the various ways in which is conceptually deployed and realized in practice. Whether we accept that human dignity has any meaning or not, or we believe that other concepts can do a better job with fewer philosophical commitments and less metaphysical pain, we all acknowledge that it is a concept that we cannot ignore. Its importance does not lie so much in its articulation but in its personal, social, and political use. It is one of those concepts or beliefs which shapes our lives and relationships, and therein lies our need to understand the significance of its meaning and appeal.2

Two preliminary observations by way of an apologia may be in order.

# The problem of translation

We have become familiar with the terms 'Church' and 'religion', but if they are used as purely social or political descriptors they tend to distort rather than illuminate. We may feel that we have named a reality, but that does not necessarily mean that we have understood it. Indeed, our naming may block understanding or translate realities into systems that are strategies of conceptual if not social and political subjugation. When religion is translated into a secular framework of thought, it is named, but it is also given a particular understanding from within that system which may or may not bear much relationship to the life and the experience ofthose who live and create it. Indeed, the naming may well be a conscious elimination--demythologization-of those things which in fact sustain the life. The same may be the case when religion reads the secular. This is even more complex when we come to concepts that are used across many different discourses and are embedded in histories and systems of thought and practice. Such is the case with dignity.

The way in which dignity has been deployed across a wide field of discourses, at least in Western cultures, it seems principally, but not always, to be attached in some way to the idea of the human. One usually does not have to probe very far behind arguments about dignity to find a deeper argument (and assumptions) about what it means to be human and the relationships, entitlements, rights, and responsibilities tP.at might follow from this. It is at this level that Catholic theology is a significant critical voice. It performs a dual purpose: internally, it expresses the logic of the believing community's faith to itself, testing its coherence and exploring the frontiers of its experience of the reality it names God in and through its own historical existence. In this way the community of faith, the Church, holds itself accountable to the truth it believes itself to have received and desires to live. As well as helping to mediate the faith of the community to cultures which do not share or understand its faith, theology also mediates to the community the sources of knowledge, critique, insight, or wisdom which it finds in cultures as well. At its best, this mediation is not a one-sided apologetics but a genuine dialogue, which allows itself to be shaped not only by the knowledge of what it brings but also by the understanding it discovers and receives from others. In this activity, all parties need to be aware of their hermeneutical commitments and horizons.

#### A life-world

Roman Catholicism is not a movement, an idea, or an institution; it is a world. For all its institutional form and swagger, it is a complex, dynamic, universal, and personal reality which extends in history. It understands itself to be a Church, which means that it does not see itself as self-founding. Rather, it understands itself to be 'gathered' by the Holy Spirit that it may not only participate in the life of Christ-whom it believes to be risen and active in all history-but from whom it has received its mission to make him known. This mission is not one of a political or cultural imperialism, although in different centuries it has unfortunately been co-opted to these designs; it is essentially one of service.3 Insofar as the love of God is inseparable from the love of neighbour, the Church is at the service of the whole of humanity; it is not conditional upon having faith in Christ or belonging to the Church. Its service is not only practical but also intellectual: it is concerned that humanity should understand its own nature, meaning, and purpose, with a view to creating societies and cultures where all men and women can flourish.

There are two dimensions to this mission which are not easily understood, and can lead to misunderstanding about the responsibility the Church has to the integrity of its own discourse and the creativity which is required by fidelity to the revelation which it believes it holds. First, the Church does not believe that it is the master (or mistress) of its own speech. It is always accountable to God, to the community, and to the world to which it has to speak about this God.4 Second, if the understanding of God which it possesses is true, if God has become human in Jesus ofNazareth, and ifthis Jesus is risen from the dead, and if the Spirit of God is now given as God's own witness to himself in Christ, then we cannot look upon the world with the same eyes and understanding as someone who does not have this knowledge in faith. It is not so much that we inhabit different worlds, but our understanding of it, its limits and possibilities, its meaning and purpose will be radically different. How then to think and speak of this new reality? How are we changed by it? So, the Church is constantly engaged in constructing a metaphysics of the Incarnation and hence a metaphysics of the human person and all that this entails. It understands this to be an impossible task, but it is also one that is generative and compels an engagement with other ontological and epistemological systems. This is to say nothing about whether it is engaged upon the most creative intellectual, imaginative, and spiritual adventure, or if it is a presumptive 'foolishness upon stilts'. We will not understand what dignity might mean in the Catholic theological tradition if we do not appreciate its

metaphysical context. In other words, 'human dignity' stands within a tradition of thought which shapes its understanding. Although it will have many features in common with other ways in which it is thought, it will nevertheless be developed and changed in the light of Christian faith. If we are to understand how human dignity is used and the range of meanings have within the discourse, we need to be attentive not only to its own internal logic or grammar but to how it is historically situated. When this does not happen, then there is a danger of misunderstanding-sometimes serious misunderstanding-and consequently the loss of the subsequent goods that genuine dialogue may bring. I think this danger is present in two recent stimulating and influential treatments of dignity.

In different degrees and with different sensibilities, both Michael Rosen and Jeremy Waldron recognize the significance of Catholic thought in understanding human dignity. 5 However, neither attempts to situate the use of dignity within the tradition of Catholic philosophical and theological discourse. Briefly, we may take Rosen as a good example of the difficulties we have been identifying.

To frame his discussion, Rosen argues that dignity typically has three ways of being understood: as social position, as intrinsic value, not restricted to human beings, and as a value which belongs particularly to human beings. The third he largely attributes to Kant, but he strangely attributes the second to Aquinas, which he then takes to be the Catholic position. Leaving aside Rosen's interpretation of Kant, which I think is insightful, he bases his reading of Aquinas on one text from Thomas's *Commentary on the Sentences* to the effect that 'dignity signifies something's good on account of itself' .6 He understands this in terms of the intrinsic value which gives a thing its place in creation. But one text from the *Sentences* seems a slim base on which to rest the reading, not only of Aquinas on human dignity but that of the whole Catholic tradition.

Aquinas mentions 'dignity' or its cognate at least 1,760 times in his writings. 7 It certainly is a way of speaking about intrinsic value, but it is not used

(Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012). In this chapter I concentrate on Rosen's presentation of Catholic thought on dignity because it offers the better illustration of how the tradition can be inadequately read.

in the undifferentiated way asserted by Rosen. He seems unaware of the ways in which Aquinas grounds the dignity in an ontology of the human person received in terms of the theology of the Trinity. In its highest and most complete use it applies to God, but it is an especial quality of the human person- *'persona est nomen dignitatis'. 8* Moreover, Rosen fails to notice that there is a dynamic and moral aspect to dignity in Thomas's treatment which becomes significantly developed in the transcendental Thomism of theologians such as Joseph This combines with the recovery of patristic sources, particularly through the ressourcement movement, to produce a creative philosophical and theological anthropology which informs Catholic thinking and the Church's engagement with the contemporary secular world.9 As a result, even though Rosen claims to be offering a history of dignity and its meaning, he fails to appreciate the way in which dignity is used within Catholic discourse, leaving many significant aspects unexplored, even when they might benefit his own thesis. 10

That Rosen has his own a priori reading ofthe Catholic tradition becomes evident in his treatment of Pope Leo XIII and John Paul II. For example, without regard to the historical context of the argument, he selects a text from Leo XIII's *Quod Apostolici Muneris* (1878) to illustrate the anti-egalitarian use of dignity which appears to characterize Catholic thought. 11 To this end,

11 Rosen, *Dignity,* 48. It may be helpful here to make the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic uses of 'dignity': a distinction which is already present in Cicero's uses, that is, that which is common to all men and marks them out from animals, and that which belongs to a particular role or individual excellence. The former applies to that which is inviolable and inalienable and the latter to social differentiation, rank, and office, hence responsibility. It is clear, even from the text which is quoted, that Leo is defending the 'dignity' of particular roles and offices in society. This is within the context of the social and political revolutions of the nineteenth century and the Church's opposition to socialism, communism, and certain ways of understanding democracy. Its basic objection to the theory of democracy lies in the source of power and hence accountability. The Church rejects the view that the ultimate source of power and political legitimacy is the people rather than God, whose laws, accessible through reason and natural law, even governments are obliged to obey. Rosen misses the significance of personalist and neo-Thomist movements on Catholic social thought, especially in the area of the

<sup>8</sup> I Sent. 10.1.5. also *Summa Theologiae* 1 29 a 3ad 2 in the context of the appropriateness of speaking of God as a 'person', 'Et quia magnae dignitatis est in rationali natura subsistere, ideo onme individuum rationalis naturae dicitur persona, ut dictum est. Sed dignitas divinae naturae excedit onmem dignitatem, et secundum hoc maxime competit Deo nomen personae.'

Rosen wants to attribute an anti-egalitarian position to Catholicism. It is significant that Rosen misses the encyclical's use of this sort of distinction a few paragraphs before his quotation, where the equality is strongly affirmed: 'the equality of men consists in this: that all, having inherited the same nature, are called to the same most high dignity of the sons of God, and that, as one and the same end is set before all, each one is to be judged by the same law and will receive punishment or reward according to his deserts'. 12 This is a comprehensive statement of equality, but especially of ultimate accountability in which responsibilities and corresponding rights may be applied. Rosen does not discuss the considerable arguments against slavery and in favour of social and economic justice mounted by Leo XIII in other writings which are developed out of the same understanding of dignity. This is especially in evident in *Rerum Novarum,* where 'the inviolable right to innate dignity of the individual person was the principle underlying the whole encyclical' .13 There is a similar problem with Rosen's use of texts from John Paul II. I think this lack of an attentive critical engagement is a loss for both sides, but especially for

meaning of 'person', which allows Catholicism and Catholic thinkers to play such a significant role in the formulation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the German Grundgesetz. For the latter, the role of figures such as Konrad Adenauer is recognized, but for Jacques Maritain's influences see Edward M. Andries, 'On the German Constitution's fiftieth anniversary: Jacques Maritain and the 1949 Basic Law (Grundgesetz)', *Emory International Law Review* 13 (1999), 1-76.

<sup>12</sup> *Quod Apostolici Muneris* §5. The encyclical deals with the claims of socialism, communism, and nihilism, which are seen as political and social threats as well as philosophical challenges. It is part of Leo XIII's extensive programme to balance social order which must ultimately be accountable to the Divine Law entailing the common good with the requirements of political and economic justice. Here, Divine Law should be read not only in terms of Revelation but in terms of the whole natural law tradition, and esp,ecially in the significant body of political theory developed not only from Thomism but also in the Salamanca school, to name but two influential sources. The Encyclical aims to correct and refute the 'socialists' use of the *imago Dei* to conclude that 'no respect or honour' is owed to public authority and that laws have no claim other than by consent. One also needs to exercise considerable caution in applying contemporary political understands to the nineteenth-century movements. On the significance of the School of Salamanca in political and economic thought, see Andre Azevedo Alves and Jose Manuel Moreira, *The Salamanca School* (New York and London, Continuum, 2010). For a study of the way in which the question of political authority and the right to overthrow a developed in Catholic political thought, see Harold E. Braun, *Juan de Mariana and Early Modern Spanish Political Thought* (Aldershot, Ashgate, 2007), and Harro Hopfl, *Jesuit Political Thought, The Society of Jesus and the State 1540-1630* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2004).

See also the encyclicals *In Plurimus* (1888), Catholicae *Ecclesiae*  (1890), and especially *Graves Communi* (1901) for a more nuanced and accurate understanding of the nineteenth-century Church's position regarding egalitarianism than is provided by Rosen. See Paul Misner, *Social Catholicism in Europe* (New York, Crossroads Publishing Company, 1991), for a treatment of these themes and the development of Catholicism's developing positions in their historical context.

Rosen's own proposal that dignity is 'the sense of being treated with respect for one's humanity' .14 This seems to be a precarious exhortation to some quasi-mystical notion, a *'Gefohl'.* Essentially, it leaves unanswered and largely unexamined the very premise on which it is based, that is, humanity. Yet this is the substance of the Catholic tradition. 15

### Person and *imago Dei: imago Trinitatis*

It is clear that the Catholic understanding and use of 'dignity' is grounded in an ontology of the human person. 16 The most complete statement of this position is in the documents of Vatican II, especially *Gaudium et Spes* and *Dignitatis Humanae. 17* They represent a development not only contained in *Pacem et Terris,* the encyclical of John XXIII, but which also can be traced in the wartime radio addresses ofPius XII. 18

Disputes about the Catholic position and the arguments it draws from dignity are actually disputes not only about its ontology but about whether

<sup>14</sup> Rosen, *Digniry,* 157. Rosen seeks to find a role for dignity which is not dependent upon God or what he calls Platonism-'timelessly valuable things to which we must act with respect or reverence' (156). He fails to appreciate that Catholic thought on dignity not only offers theological reasons but reasons that can, I believe, function independently of theological premises but are developed on the basis of an analysis of the intrinsic value of the human person which is part of the position that Aquinas wishes to establish. Non-Catholic readers of the discourse forget that Catholicism not only argues from faith but also from reason, especially through its natural law traditions.

This is critical for understanding why the two approaches are developed in different ways.

ontology is possible at all. However, if dignity is not to be grounded in an ontology of the person, what is to prevent it simply being reduced to contingent social and cultural values which can be quickly manipulated? If dignity is a way of marking rank and worth, who decides how, when, and to whom or what it is to be applied? Legal provision is precarious at best, evidenced by the infamous ruling of the American Supreme Court on the status of Dred Scott in 1857. It is but one classic example, but many contemporary examples could also be cited. The grounding of dignity in the ontology of person is, therefore, an attempt to protect the value of all human beings and of holding all societies accountable. 19

The most common theological route to an understanding of dignity is through the idea of the *imago Dei-'the* image and likeness of the Divine with which each human being is endowed'. 20 This is based on the text from Genesis 1.26. Given Judaism's prohibition against any images of the Divine, it is a most remarkable text that already signals the status of the human person within the created order.21 It immediately links humanity and God in the most intimate of relationships. Not only is the human person summoned to honour and reverence the *imago Dei* manifest in the whole person (body and soul), but anyone who destroys or degrades another human being is also dishonouring or committing sacrilege against God. It is not difficult to see how for both Judaism and Christianity the *imago Dei* establishes the unique ontology of the human person and also allows each tradition to develop a rich understanding of responsibilities and duties towards oneself and others. 22

Undoubtedly foundational, in discussions on human dignity the text of Genesis has difficulties. The *imago Dei* tends to be read and interpreted as if it is understood in the same way by all religious traditions. This is clearly not the case: as the history of the discourse shows, the Christian reading develops into the *imago Trinitatis.* Not only does this distinguish it from Islam and Judaism but it also provides an anthropology with different potentials. While the *imago*  remains foundational and normative, other ontological arguments have been

developed out of the nature of the human person in itself. Moreover, within the Christian tradition these anthropologies have significant differences, especially on the consequences of sin for the *imago.* This has consequences for the ways in which theological and practical responses to the loss, preservation, and defence of dignity are worked out.

# *Imago Trinitatis:* towards ontology of the dignity of the human person

It was the Roman lawyer Tertullian who gave the West its formula for expressing the Christian idea of a Trinitarian God: *una substantia, tres personae.* 23 As Joseph Ratzinger notes, 'it was here that the word "person" entered intellectual history with its full weight for the first time'.24 However, it is Augustine who is the most significant thinker for our purposes. If much of the contemporary discussion of human dignity develops from Renaissance thinkers, their recovery of the Augustinian tradition of the *imago Dei* 'offered a possibility for a renewed conception of the dignity of man, of man as a god on earth and not as an object of nature' .25

Augustine's insight was to see that the *imago Dei* of Genesis had now to be read as the *imago Trinitatis* if Christian revelation was to be coherent. In exploring the full radical implications of this coherence, he was to open up a new chapter in philosophical and theological anthropology which was dominant in the West until comparatively recent times. His opus on the Trinity *(De Trinitate)* is Augustine's masterclass in logic, philosophical speculation, and biblical hermeneutics.26 Yet from the beginning, Augustine conceived it as a

23 *Adversus Praxean* 2 3-7. Tertullian, edited with an introduction, translation, and commentary by Ernest Evans (London, SPCK, 1948). Part of the problem with the use of'person' in theology is that it has different meanings when it refers to the Trinity and to human beings. The use must be analogical; if it is used univocally then one produces tritheism rather than a Trinity. This problem with the highly specialized use of 'person' with regard to the Trinity is recognized by two major influential thinkers in contemporary theology: Karl Barth, *Church Dogmatics,* vol. 1 §9.2. ET (Edinburgh, T. & T. Clark, 2009), and Karl Rahner, *The Trinity* III. E. trans. Joseph Donceel (London, Bums and Oates, 1970).

Robert Dodaro and George Lawless (London, Routledge, 2000), 51-76; also M. R. Barnes, 'Re-reading Augustine's theology of the Trinity', inS. T. Davies, D. Kendall, and G. O'Collins (eds), *The Trinity: An Interdisciplinary Symposium on the Doctrine of the Trinity* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1999).

search whose outcome could only be tentative. Indeed, in Book 15, reviewing the fruits of his intellectual labours, he critiques them as inadequate.27 The significance for our discussion lies in Book 8. The first seven books are devoted to an exploration and defence of the logical and creedal coherence of the Christian belief in God as Trinity. In Book 8 he sets out on a more radical path. If Christian revelation is true, and God is a Trinity and the human person is made in the image of God, then we must in some way be able to discover the *imago Trinitatis* in the human person. If we cannot, then the coherence of revelation and its truth become questionable. Working with the Trinitarian formula articulated by Tertullian (one God in three 'persons'-Augustine is happy to admit the problematic nature of 'person' in this context), he explores various triads that also describe some sort of unity. They all fall short of the logic that the doctrine of the Trinity demands. Finally, he settles upon the least unsatisfactory, namely, the famous human trinity of 'memory, understanding and will' *(memoria, intelligentia, voluntas).28* This opens the way for a new Christian anthropology which subsequent centuries will develop.

There are two critical aspects of Augustine's treatment which need to be remembered if we are not to misread him. The first concerns mind. Why he regards memory, understanding, and will as strong candidates is because they are the actions of the one mind. They do not constitute three independent subjects but are a dynamic relational action in which and through which mind manifests itself.29 To borrow a term from later scholastic thought, mind subsists in the action of memory, understanding, and will.

For Augustine, memory is not just recall of the past but the way in which the world is represented to us interiorly so that it may be known. 30 Here, as elsewhere, he is relying upon the Neo-Platonist tradition but also shaping it to Christian needs. If memory is the capacity we have to know, then our understanding is our ordering to know Truth, and our will is our ordering in freedom to act in our choice of the Good. Love is a central governing interior power for Augustine, and our understanding and will, indeed our whole being, is directed by love: knowing and willing is a loving of the true, the good, and the

29 Augustine's discovery of the relational nature of 'persons' in the Trinity *(De Trinitate,* Book V, 5.6- 7) is not sufficiently emphasized in many standard treatments, which are too much influenced by older and now untenable critiques of his Trinitarian theology as stressing the unity of God over the Trinity.

30 See Augustine, *Confessions,* Book X. For Augustine, Memory is a sort of 'Chora' -a great source of ideas, images and emotions and, in some sense, the origin and possibility of our knowing and loving. Hence it stands as an image of the mystery of the Father.

<sup>27</sup> *De Trinitate,* Bk XV. 6, 1 Off.

<sup>28</sup> As well as the need to find some 'imago' of the Trinity in the human person, Augustine's search for suitable analogies is also constrained by a logical need, namely, finding ways of adequately representing unity and multiplicity through God's simplicity.

beautiful. It is a mistake to think of Augustine working with a static ontology. It is part of his creative genius responding to the intelligibility of Revelation to see essence *(substantia)* expressing itself in existence. This is especially the case in the human person. For Augustine, therefore, the *imago Trinitatis* is not simply something which we have, it is something which we live; indeed, it is that which gives us the capacity to do so. If we think of dignity in this context, then it is not only a quality possessed or attributed but a manifestation of our

person in our way ofliving.31 The second aspect concerns the way in which mind realizes itself in pursuit of the True and the Good. Ultimately, mind is only fully expressive of the *imago Trinitatis* when it is seeking or ordered to God, who is Goodness and Truth. This also applies to our seeking to love God's image in our neighbours.32 In other words, Augustine offers a fully theological anthropologywe cannot know or become ourselves without in some way being in relation to God. If the first part of his treatment of the *imago* could allow for a plausible argument that Augustine stands behind the Enlightenment and Modernity, the second part could, with equal plausibility, make him one of its greatest contestants regarding coherence of its self-founding claims. This may offer some explanation for the tensions within the Catholic tradition and the various ways in which it responds to secular modernity. 33

Although Augustine himself regarded his trinity of memory, understanding, and will as completely inadequate, it nevertheless offered a highly suggestive account of the human person and our relation to God's own life. Though criticized-! believe unfairly-by the Eastern Orthodox traditions-Augustine has proved to be a rich source of theological and philosophical speculation. He has not always been well used, and his legacy within Catholicism and Protestantism has frequently been controversial and problematic. Nevertheless, Augustine, to borrow a phrase of Michel Foucault, is one of the 'founders of our discursivity'.

It is not necessary for our purposes to follow all the twists and turns of the *imago* other than to identify two strands which are important in an appreciation of dignity in the Catholic ontology of the person.

### Rationality/freedom and relationality

Even from this brief sketch we can see how strongly the theme of rationality or understanding and freedom feature in the Augustinian account. This comes even more pronounced in Aquinas. 34 As we have indicated, he inherits Augustine's insight regarding the way in which the *imago Trinitatis* informs our understanding of the dignity and unique status of the human person. Increasingly, this comes to be located in human rationality and freedom. Boethius's classic definition of the human person as 'an individual substance in a rational *nature'(naturae rationalis individua substantia)* is the one with which Aquinas chooses to work.35 Even though it is more difficult to integrate into Trinitarian usage, it allows for greater anthropological development and precision. 36

In Aquinas, person comes to signify what is unique, individual, and incommunicable. In this sense, it takes over the meaning of the Greek idea of *hypostasis* deployed, especially by the Cappadocians, in clarifying the uniqueness of the Trinitarian relations. For Aquinas, person 'designates an individual so excellent that it possesses a rational nature' .37 In his thought, dignity is located in the ontology of the person worked out through the doctrine of the Trinity and Christology. Why is it fitting that the Son of God (the Logos) should take on *human* nature? Aquinas argues that human nature is the proper object of the Incarnation of the Logos for two reasons: dignity of human nature and its need.38

Dignity lies in human nature's rational capacity, the ability to know and love God, the Augustinian *imago Dei.* The need of our human nature flows from original sin's crippling effect, which diminishes our dignity though it does not destroy it completely.39 Not only is our dignity redeemed through the Incarnation, it is elevated so that it is even more splendid than before. As Pinckaer argues, quoting Aquinas, one of the reasons for the Incarnation

35 Aquinas, *Summa Theologica* I-11.85; 73.2; 73.4.

39 Aquinas, *Summa Theologica* III.4.1; also ST I.93.

<sup>34</sup> The significance of Aquinas for contemporary Catholic thought is due to Leo XIII, who in his encyclical *Aeterni Patris* (1879) established Aquinas as the principal authority for Catholic theology and philosophy, hence the renewal of Thomism in the twentieth century as his thought was brought into dialogue with modern schools of philosophy.

<sup>37</sup> Pinckaers, 'Aquinas on the dignity of the human person', 149. See Aquinas, *Summa Theologica* I q 29. 2, which Aquinas will wish to apply to God. However, we must always keep clearly in mind that 'person' when used of the Trinity is not the same as 'person' when applied to human beings. The use is always analogical.

<sup>38</sup> Aquinas, *Summa Theologica* 111.4.1; Sentences Bk. III.2.1. also ST 111.2.2. ad 2 ..

is 'to teach us about the great dignity of human nature, so that we will avoid marring it by sin' .40 This brings out an important aspect of dignity, implicit in Augustine but missing in much of the contemporary treatment. The dignity of the human person has a teleology: the final consummation of human dignity consists in the beatific vision.41 When seen within this teleological horizon, person grounded in the *imago Dei* is not a static reality but one that possesses dynamism. There is a sense in which the human person is a person becoming through the realization of their dignity. Hence, the other main element in the notion of person must be freedom. 42 This is not, of course, the concept of freedom introduced by nominalism that was to become transformed into the modem notion of autonomy. For Aquinas, 'free will is the faculty of reason and will, through which the good is chosen with grace assisting or evil with grace desisting' .43 Freedom is not the capacity to do whatever we choose but rather to choose that which is true and good; it exists for excellence, and thus it serves and expresses our human dignity.44

There is another aspect of the Augustinian-Thomist tradition which it is important to recognize. While it clearly values reason as evidence of the *logos spermatikos,* it does not exalt it as does the Stoic-Kantian tradition. For both Thomas and Augustine, reason is always ordered to the true and the good, which is ultimately God's self, it is not an independent self-grounding faculty, and the dignity of the human person is not exhausted by it. Even if it were such a faculty, it is one that is deeply disordered and unstable. Reason is not immune from sin, which also has epistemological consequences that not only prevent us from knowing truly but also distort our judgements about what it is we do know. Although reason may be necessary to secure human dignity, it cannot be sufficient. This points us to the deeper insights of the Trinitarian *imago,* namely that the dignity of the human person is ultimately grounded in relationality: first to God, and then to each other. Indeed, knowing and loving are relational acts. As well as being a personal reality, dignity must then have a proper theological and social dimension.45

45 Rist, *Augustine,* draws attention to the impact of Stoicism on Augustine, especially through Cicero, but also brings out where he parts company with them. See 168fT.

<sup>42</sup> *Pace* Rosen, this is why it is necessary for Aquinas to establish a hierarchy of beings according to the power they possess over their actions. *Summa Theologica* I-II.6.1. As Pinckaers remarks, 'It is precisely this control that constitutes the perfection of the person and underlies his definition', 149. 43 Aquinas, In Sent. II.24.3.

<sup>44</sup> It is out of this tradition and its development that John Paul II and Benedict XVI speak in order to recover an ancient and alternative discourse on freedom for the post-Enlightenment world.

All of these elements in the Augustinian-Thomistic understanding of human dignity are present in varying degrees in the Catholic tradition. They undergo significant development as they are brought into debate with contemporary schools of thought. This can be seen in Vatican II's authoritative treatment ofthe dignity of the human person in Vatican II, *Gaudium et Spes. 46*  As well as giving us a dynamic approach to the dignity of the human person, *imago Trinitatis* also opens up its relational nature. This has been developed in significant ways by Catholic thinkers like Maritain and Pope John Paul II, to explore the spiritual dignity of the human person, interiority, and its ethical implications.

If the thought of Maritian was influential in this development before the Council, then Pope John Paul II is significant for the post-conciliar development. If Maritain brings Aquinas and the Catholic tradition into a fruitful dialogue with personalism, Karol Wojtyla does so with phenomenology. As we have seen, for Aquinas the dignity of the human person as *imago Dei* was found principally in a dynamic rationality and freedom of the human person. Both Maritain and Wojtyla take this up, but also stress the 'spiritual' nature ofthe human person.47 For both, self-communication that we can recognise in the inter-relational dynamic of the three persons of the Trinity is also integral to the human person as *imago Trinitatis.* It is the *imago Trinitatis* that discloses the dynamic of love at the centre of the person which constitutes subjectivity, 'Thus subjectivity reveals itself as self-mastery for self-giving ... by spiritually existing in the manner of a gift' .48 Of course, this had not been lost in either Augustine or Aquinas, but it surfaces now with new emphasis, because both writers want to find ways of resisting the instrumentalization of the human person by fascism and totalitarianism. Maritain seeks to understand the uniqueness of the person in terms of community and the common good, while Wojtyla develops the notion of solidarity and interiority. Solidarity also entails the just sharing of human goods· and those goods necessary for human life; it entails the ability to participate in society. This aspect of solidarity allows it to be developed into another basis for human rights, because rights

'are the minimum condition for participation' .49 Another important feature of Woytyla's thought, especially developed during his pontificate, is the dignity of the human body. It represents a very significant emichment of Catholic discourse on the dignity of the human person. 5°

In all these developments, the redemptive or soteriological dimension has not been lost. Indeed, it is a major feature of the treatment of the dignity of the human person in contemporary Catholic thought that the redemptive movement-the preservation of human dignity and its restoration-explores the implications for society and its structures as well as for the individual.

This new emphasis on the social dimension of dignity is also grounded in the *imago Trinitatis.* It has been a significant recovery in Catholic thought, especially in its understanding of the ontology of the human person. We can see this in two theologians who, though widely different, nevertheless seek to deepen our notion of the person through a Trinitarian perspective. Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) argues that Augustine, for all his insight, 'commits a decisive' mistake in developing his psychological model of the Trinity. 51 The problem here is that the *imago Trinitatis* is located in one faculty when it needs to be applied to the human person as whole. For Ratzinger, we lose the relationality and the dynamism that the *imago Trinitatis* requires. He

Hollenbach, *Claims in Conflict: Retrieving and Renewing the Catholic Human Rights Tradition* (New York, Paulist Press, 1979). It seems to me that there are considerable opportunities for fruitful engagement between the Catholic tradition and the 'capacities' approach of Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen. The various aporias of Nussbaum's approach in *Human Dignity and Political Entitlements,* particularly in her need both to recognize rationality as core but also resolve the problems of its hegemony in defining the human person, are dealt with, to some extent, in the Catholic approach.

approaches this through the significance of the person of Christ for the meaning of the human person:

> He [Christ] is not only an example that is followed, but he is the integrating space in which the 'we' of human beings gathers itself towards the 'you' of God. Something emerges here that has not been sufficiently seen in modern philosophy, not even in Christian philosophy. In Christianity there is not simply a dialogical principle in the modern sense of a pure 'I-Thou' relationship, neither on the part of the human person that has its place in the historical 'we' that bears it; nor is there such a mere dialogical principle on God's part who is, in turn, no simple 'I', but the 'we' of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit ... This Trinitarian 'we', the fact that God exists only as a 'we', prepares at the same time the space of the human 'we'Y

The social reality of the human person had already been emphasized in Vatican Two, but Ratzinger is making its theological foundation more explicit. 53

In a more extended way, Catherine La Cugna, exploring the implications of the doctrine of the Trinity for our understanding of the human person and society, draws out the relational dynamics of equality, mutuality, and reciprocity, which she argues characterize the intra-relationality of the 'persons' of the Trinity.54 She argues that these must be applied to persons in their relatiotis if we are to realize the full implications of the *imago Trinitatis.* In different ways, Ratzinger and La Cugna represent a development within the tradition of the *imago* which has significant implications for the ways in which we understand the nature and dignity of the human person. They also wish to emphasize the socially transformative implications of the ontology of the human person which the *imago Trinitatis* contains.

There is another aspect of this recovery of the relationality of the human person which, I believe, has far-reaching consequences for the way in which we understand the dignity of the human person and are committed to it. If it is the case that we only realize the fullness of personhood in and through our relationality-the 'we' -then this must mean that dignity too has a social dimension. In some way our dignity, qua our person and identity not just our status, is held in and by the 'we' of our relationships, personal and civic. In terms of theology, we encounter here the reality of solidarity which has both natural and supernatural dimensions. The natural dimension is that moral obligation which we owe every human being in virtue of our common humanity. Supernaturally, it is the *communio* which unites all humanity in some way to

the grace of Christ and is realized in the Church. The Church recognizes this *communio* as extending beyond space and time for its members, but given its own theology, it must also recognize this for all humanity. In this it discloses a fundamental aspect of the dignity of the human person for society as well: the dead can make a claim upon us for justice and respect. I think this is a significant witness to *solidarity/communio* in the secular sphere based upon its ontology of the human person.

Our obligation to the dead is more than *pietas;* it is a command which comes from the *imago* itself. 55 Where that *imago* remains degraded or humiliated, then so do we all; society itself remains unhealed, and it must bear the legacies of unreconciled histories. When forgetfulness or silence is accepted, the relationality of our being in the present is weakened, and we are rendered onto logically insecure. For then history belongs only to the powerful, whereas one of the most important features of dignity is the absolute claim it makes whether we are weak or strong. The ontology of the person provides a way of understanding how love (even of one's enemies) and forgiveness can also extend beyond the limits of time and space. There is a possible solution to the problem of deliberate and unintentional amnesia (forgetfulness, or suppression and distortion of memory) through anamnesis (remembrance) grounded in an understanding of the human person. By the restoration of their dignity, which needs also to recognize their histories, not only are the dead honoured but society itself is healed, and creative potentials of the future for humanity are released.

The other dimension of this relationality is the way in which our identity-our history, our life, and its value-is held by others and recognized by them. This again touches not only upon our personal value but our ontological security. Hence, even when we lose the capacity to reason or decide for ourselves, not only do we still retain our dignity-our absolute value-but othersl:an carry our dignity for us in their care, respect, and preservation of our rights. If there is no 'we' which can make that claim upon us personally and as society, then persons are ultimately instrumentalized. No matter how subtle or bureaucratically softened the process may be, instrumentalization is always a humiliation; in such a society all are diminished. 56

*<sup>55</sup>* In the Christian tradition this also extends to the bodies of the dead. This is further reinforced not only as respect for God's material creation but also for the Incarnation and the resurrection. Here, the question of reciprocity is also present, because for Christianity the person's life and identity continues after death, as does their active membership of the communio of the Church.

For a discussion of the person who 'lacks dignity' see Paul Valadier, 'The person who lacks dignity', *Concilium* 2 (2003), 51---{i.

Notwithstanding the circumstances of any given time, the fact that the dignity of the human person is not only ontologically grounded but expressed in the liturgical and existential praxis of a community such as the Church, gives . accountability a historical reality that resists erasure. That each generation, pres-. ent, past, and future, can be judged in its light also alerts us to the fact that dignity plays a role which goes beyond mere idealistic aspiration. It holds the place for the memory of what the hurrian person and human society are called to be. Whether we express this dynamic as a theology or as a secular humanism, it reveals itself to be a moral task which is both personal and social. In this sense, dignity is the epiphany of the person in our relationships and in all our social systems-national and international; it is a way in which we are able to resist de-humanization. It not only keeps open the space of the 'I' but also of the other 'Thou'; it refuses to let us forget who we are before and for each other.

# Concluding observations

It seems to me there are three brief points which arise out of this necessarily selective exploration of the Catholic tradition of the digni):y pf the human person.

#### **The soteriological aspect of human dignity**

The first is to emphasize that richness of the discourse and the way in which it continues develops through the internal theological conversation and also as it meets other sources. If it is to be engaged, then it is important to do justice to its complexity if one is to maximize the benefits. It will be clear from the way in which dignity is grounded in the ontology of the person that the locus of rights is in the person and not in a legal system. As Maritain observes, rights are not granted by society but recognised as universally valid, 'and which no social necessity can authorize us even momentarily to abolish or disregard' .57 Rights, then, become the ways in which the dignity of the person is recognized in society. Dignity preserves the priority of the person over the dangerous impersonal demands of society.

Human dignity not only has a part to play in a secular theodicy which seeks to prevent, minimize, or overcome the effects of evil, it is part of a soteriology which runs through the whole of Christian understanding. Even from the brief indications given here, we can see how dignity is understood as

<sup>57</sup> Jacques Maritain, *Man and State* (Washington DC, Catholic University of America Press, 1998), 96.

a dynamic reality: something which we are and possess, but also something which we are called to realize both in ourselves and in others. This highlights the soteriological nature of human dignity for Catholic thought. Soteriology is the unfolding of the economy of salvation, the way in which God, through Christ, is at work in our world to restore and raise up our dignity as the *imago Deilimago Trinitatis.* This is a work in which we are not merely passive objects but active agents-for our very participation and cooperation are already part of the way in which God recognizes our dignity. Moreover, the very fact of the cross in which we are presented with the abject humiliation of Christ is simultaneously the witness that God makes to the indestructibility of our dignity. For this reason, Christianity knows that no matter how humiliated or degraded the human person has become, his or her dignity is always held secure in the crucified Christ. In this way, the Cross not only secures our dignity but also subverts all attempts to destroy it.

#### **Dignity as task**

The 'soteriological' dimension of dignity has practical and effective consequences. Again, the recognition of human dignity cannot be a passive recognition. To be effective, it must be translated into structures which recognize and preserve the conditions in which people can flourish-can practise their dignity in the sense of striving for human excellence. This is the striving for the virtuous life across all the fields of human endeavour. Dignity cannot be only a claim we make upon each other or upon society; it must be one that we upon ourselves, especially in the service of the good of others and of our societies. From a Christian point of view, we cannot do this unaided; we need God's grace. Whether we accept this premise or not, it is surely possible to establish a creative partnership between all who desire the common good. Kasper acknowledges that rights in some way grounded in a universal recognition of human dignity need to find expression in practical structures. 58 How we create these structures and the values which they enshrine emerges out of the philosophical, political, and theological discussion which our concern for dignity requires us to pursue. Although the outcomes are tested and developed in practice and in theory, they require communities to embody and espouse them. In other words, the idea of dignity needs to be incarnated: embodied in the *habitus* of a community so as to become part of its social memory. I believe that the Church is such a community; it is one of the principal agents within culture which carries that memory or *habitus* for all women and men. The significance of the Church

<sup>58</sup> Kasper, *Theological Foundations,* 149.

lies in the way in which it mediates the sacred and the secular worlds. Given that its commitment to human dignity does not ultimately rest on any philosophical system, political or social hierarchy of power, but on what it understands to be Revelation, then the Church must be one of the consistent carriers of this foun- . dational value. It does not mean that its understanding of human dignity cannot change, rather that out of its commitment it is obliged to seek ever more coherent and persuasive ways of defending human dignity theoretically, politically, socially. If it truly perceives the dignity of each person, *imago Trinitatis,* then the Church must recognize and live this *ad intra* as well as *ad extra.* 

#### The nature of dignity as mystery

In theological discourse, mystery is not an intellectual dead end; it is a point of departure. Mystery is the capacity for inexhaustible meaning, and so the fact that we cannot settle the question of dignity is not a reason to abandon it but to attend to it more closely. It may well be that it names something for us which is essential, without which our person and our society would be impoverished, if not endangered. Human dignity, as we have argued, does not devalue the dignity of other things whether they are other forms oflife or matter. The teleology of dignity is theologically expressed as our vocation as persons to act in ways consonant with our dignity-bearers of the *imago Dei/imago Trinitatis,*  which is also the *imago Christi.* It entails an ethical relationship to oneself as well as to others: to act towards them so as not to diminish our dignity, and to recognize the dignity which they also have. Far from placing us 'above' creation, this inserts us more deeply into it, opening up the realm of our responsibilities for all creation. In doing so, it commits us to the search for meaning, structures, actions which in some way enshrine dignity. To this extent, dignity has a heuristic function; it is part of our own search for the meaning of who we are and the sort of societies we are called to create. Our dignity as persons requires of us an intellectual, moral, ethical, and spiritual search. This cannot be undertaken without openness to new ways of understanding what the dignity of the human person might mean, and what we need to do to preserve and nourish it. 59 Human dignity is both our *terminus a quo* and our *terminus ad quem;* in the words of the psalmist: 'What is man *[sic]* that you remember him and the son of man that you visit him? You have made him little less than the angels, with glory and honour you crown him. ' 60
