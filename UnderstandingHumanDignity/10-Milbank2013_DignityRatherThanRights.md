# **Dignity Rather than Rights**

#### *John Milbank*

#### Dignity and rights: fusion and instability

THERE IS LITTLE AGREEMENT on the usage of 'dignity', in particular its relationship to rights. For some, the recent use of dignity is a useful supplement to, or at least ornament for, the language of rights. For others, dignity tends to dilute the rights of individuals and must, therefore, be resisted and rejected, especially when dignity is allied with a religious vision. Still further, a small intellectual minority (myself included) see dignity as a more valid alternative to rights.

Before 1948, human dignity and rights were scarcely invoked together. It was only with the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the old German Federal Republic's provisional (in view of the division of the country) *Grundgesetz* that we really began to see a yoking of the two. 1 This post-1948 shift can be understood in terms of a double rejection, both of totalitarian suppression of human freedom and of unprecedentedly brutal treatment of certain classes of human beings. But, more precisely, one can understand this yoking in terms of the coming together of two quite different and indeed fundamentally opposed traditions of political and ethical reflection.

The first is the liberal, eventually secular, tradition of human rights that had been made the basis of the American Constitution and more fitfully ofthe various French constitutions since the Revolution.2 For this tradition, the high status of human beings is self-given, whether because they 'own themselves' (the Lockean tradition of 'possessive individualism') or because they are divinely constituted as originally free and must therefore accord themselves a sacred respect as the trustees of an untradeable liberty (the Rousseauian

tradition). In either case, rights are derived from the exercise of subjective freedom or from human autonomy, and require no other foundation. Little or no mention is made of dignity.

The other tradition is largely Catholic, though it has many parallels in other Christian denominations. It concerns a defence of human existence in all its modes in terms of the category of dignity. In this discourse, which arose in the nineteenth century, there is a fluctuation between the notion of respect for the dignity of the human person as such and respect for various human roles such as, above all, the 'dignity oflabour'. Such fluctuation, as I shall explain in this chapter, is both endemic to and coherent within the entire notion of dignity as it had been inherited from Classical, Patristic, and Medieval times. For this reason, this tradition could hold together respective emphases upon the dignity of the human as such, the dignity of roles, and of groups.

Attempting to mediate between these traditions, and the unlikely marriage of dignity and rights, was Kantian thought, especially in Germany. For Kant had assumed and further spiritualized Rousseau's approach to right and liberty: we do not own our own freedom, which is a divine gift, trumping the mutability and tradeability of the material sphere. Hence it is morally illicitto commit suicide, tell a lie, or surrender to sensuality for its own sake. Just for this reason Kant had spoken of human dignity or *wilrde. 3* 

However, I agree with both Samuel Moyn and Michael Rosen that this fusion is much more unstable than has often appeared to be the case. After 2001, we have witnessed a second upsurge of 'dignity' discourse. Arguably, this has qualified rights discourse. The reasons for this second wave are somewhat more obscure, but it can plausibly be taken that they parallel the post-1948 invocation. People have been horrified by the scant respect for human life, human suffering, and the accepted modes of human existence and human interaction exhibited both by terrorists and states since 9111. There exists an anxiety that rights supposedly based upon autonomy and contract can logically be suspended in the case of 'terrorists' who refuse that contract. Refugees who have been accidentally placed outside state and legal contract often seem to fall beyond the sway of rights. And in either case, loss of rights seem to result in a loss of humanity, a casting out into a limbo unworthy of either the respect we accord to humans or the sympathy we sometimes accord to animals. For even though rights are deemed 'natural', if no pre-political divine establishment and enforcement of rights is admitted, then natural rights must, paradoxically, be positively instituted by human law. They are only natural in

the Hobbesian sense of being founded upon a supposedly natural condition of pre-contractual egotism, which was not, in itself, a state of right. In a usually inchoate and inexplicit way, the resurgence of appeal to dignity besides rights or even as the foundation of rights seems to register an anxiety about the limits of secular recognition of human worth as rights.

But the instability of the alliance between rights and dignity also concerns the nature of Catholic social teaching. Blending corporatist and personalist understandings, Catholic social teaching stressed, and continues to stress, valuing the person as rationally free and as possessing an irreplaceably specific character, or role. 'Character', as Aristotle, Cicero, and Aquinas made clear, is not just given by nature but is also habitually acquired, ascribed, and chosen. It therefore does not exist outside relationality and social reciprocity. One does not, as in liberal thought, respect a man as man per se, a bearer of abstract rights.

This difference of understanding could be construed as an internal and external contrast. One could say that the liberal view sees dignity as an internal phenomenon of concealed willing, while the Catholic view sees dignity as an external phenomenon of human position within the cosmic order and equally of individual human position within the social order. In that sense, internal versus external would seem to express two divergent conceptions of dignity. However, this is far too simplistic. First, modem conceptions of dignity after all split internally between interior and exterior in their own specific way. And second, so do ancient and medieval ones, but in a different way. Exploring this split, I will try to show that the key contrast turns out to be a modem incapacity to mediate the internal and external, compared with the ancient-perspective, especially in its Catholic Christian variant as inherited in later Catholic social teaching.

Internal and external dignities

#### **Liberal dignity as duty or utility**

First, the modem division and disjunction of the dignified. Take the notion of 'dying with dignity'. This refers in part to the interior dimension of human life: our capacity for a rational exercise of freedom. A dignified death is, supposedly, a death whose place and hour has, in theory, been freely chosen by . the individual who is mortally ill, at a point before he has lost all capacity for autonomous decision, and so, for this perspective, all dignity.

Yet dignity with respect to death also refers in part to the most external circumstances of human life. A 'dignified death' is taken to be one that involves a minimum of pain, discomfort, physical mess, or distressing circumstances.

This split clearly reflects a more general modem·division between deontological and utilitarian approaches to ethics--especially if we take the 'utile' to refer in the widest possible sense to the convenient and pleasurable. Thus, the same duality of dignity is extended from death to life in general. On the one hand, to live with dignity is to live not in any sense as a slave but as an autonomous being who has chosen or at least assented to her career, dwelling-place, friendships, and economic contracts. On the other hand, a dignified life is taken to be one where we enjoy enough food, decent shelter and clothing, protection from the natural environment, mechanized transport, access to professional healthcare, educational expertise, and informational and social media.

Again we see the contrast between, and yet typical combination of, the deontological and the utilitarian. Deontological aspects of dignity more readily apply to human adults, while utilitarian ones extend to children, and to a lesser degree are extended to certain animals. Michael Rosen struggles to explain how he personally requires a dignified treatment of dead bodies in secular terms outside these ethical frameworks-that is to say, even when no human freedom is at issue and no pleasure or displeasure to the living.4 More to the point might be the observation that in fact respectful treatment of the dead (as of the dying) is increasingly violated in secular society.

It is therefore not simply the case that liberalism thinks of dignity as internal or invisible right, while Catholicism thinks of dignity as external or visible status. For it also turns out that liberalism combines the invisible dignity of right with the visible dignity of style and convenience. A lack of integration between the two is revealed in the fluctuations of public policy, where we possess no criterion by which to decide whether to concentrate on making people freer or more comfortable, ecstatically liberated or soberly healthy. In consequence, we often end up contradictorily pursuing libertinism in one domain and Spartan discipline in others: for example, liberalizing drug laws while extending draconian bans on smoking, or permitting adult pornography while forbidding children from even touching each other (as debated in a number of Australian schools today). The greatest synthesis we can ever achieve is a banal one that divides and rules the two incompatible modem ethical theories: people are thus rendered freer 'to choose' between ferociously marketed different versions of comfortable indulgence and programmes for self-discipline.

However, the political legacy that Catholicism inherited had, from the outset, its own mode of doubling dignity between the visible and the invisible. The Latin *dignitas* lies close to the word *decus,* meaning 'ornament' or 'honourable reward', and also to *decorum,* meaning 'socially acceptable ethical style', and ultimately to the Greek *dokein,* meaning 'to show', and *doxa,*  meaning 'shining manifestation', glory or honour, inherently proceeding or bestowed from without. Yet on the other hand, as Mette Lebech points out, *dignitas* also translates the Greek *axia,* meaning not just fundamental worth but also 'first principle', as in our gerivative 'axiom'. 5 Hence the scholastics translated the Greek *axia* in logical and mathematical contexts as *dignitas.* So for Aquinas, for example, *dignf(as* l:Jleans both something good in itself and something taken to be true in itself. 6

This suggests something like a paradox of dignity. The dignified is selfstanding and independent; as such, it is sufficient to itself and so reserved. Yet the dignified is equally what gloriously shows itself, and even that which receives a supplement of honour from others. It is at once (like the number one in ancient mathematics) that which requires no addition, and yet is the very principle of addition. In fact, we still tend to register a paradox when we ascribe dignity: dignified motion, for example, is a motion that somehow moves without deserting a statue-like immobile erectness; a dignified gesture is one that somehow combines reserve-or non-gesture-with expression that necessarily negates reserve. Like sublime speech in rhetoric (which is itself traditionally dignified speech in contrast to the charm and delight of conversation), the dignified gesture makes a simpler and greater impact precisely through the exercise of restraint.

And this paradox is no trivial thing: instead dignity as both reserved and manifest would seem to have been the very heart of the classically syncretic ideal of the fully rounded man *(sic* )-the individual of wise contemplation who bestows his gifts ofwisdom through practical action in the city. Yet this ideal was but precariously held together, as we can see if we examine the respective roles of *axia* in Aristotle and *dignitas* in Cicero.

#### Ancient dignity as reserved and expressed

For Aristotle, different political constitutions can be defined in terms of their 'axiomatic' preferences, or of what for them counts as dignity. For a democ-

racy it is simply free birth; for an oligarchy possession of wealth; for an aristocracy possession ofvirtue.7

Aristotle at times appeared to understand virtue in terms of the flourishing of an individual who attains an inner balance of the emotions and between emotions and reason. If, for example, an individual needs friends, it is to amend his loneliness and to enjoy utility, companionship, and agreement concerning the good. Yet this seeming individualism is massively qualified by Aristotle's statement that complete virtue involves also the virtuous treatment of others for their own sakes. The stated implication is that entire virtue is justice in a more general sense than specific justice, which is concerned with the distribution and exchange of inherently incommensurable resources.8 In this sense, for Aristotle as for Plato, an originally 'manly' virtue of martial or philosophical restraint (inner, invisible dignity) gives way to a more relational understanding of virtue as work, justice, gift, and mutual dependency ( external, visible dignity).

Aristotle defines *axia* not as a lonely principle but as something on which other truths and goods depend and to which it gives rise: it is 'a term of relation: It denotes having a claim to goods external to oneself' and supremely to the best mode of tribute, which is honour.9 As Robert L. Gallagher argues in a remarkable recent essay, Aristotle actually calls into question virtue as an axiomatic standard if by that we understand an inert, already achieved status. 10 Aristotle no more accords to that any political or economic worth than he does to the given achievement of birth or of income. Instead, he understands specifically political virtue as an *ergon,* ·or as the exercise of a function or role-socially speaking a *leitourgia,* which the Latins translated as *officium.* 

As Gallagher points out, Aristotle in the *Eudemian Ethics* includes justice within friendship rather than the other way around: 'the whole of justice is in relation to a friend, for what is just is just for certain persons, and persons who are partners, and a friend is a partner, either in one's family or in one's life'.U So for Aristotle it is not merely that justice trumps personal virtue and so politics ethics, but also and almost inversely, justice turns out to be always to do with a series of specific 'civic friendships' of many variously appropriate kinds, and the *polis* to be the open totality of the asymmetric reciprocities between incommensurable goods and persons that composes specific

justice. 12 It is as if the private gives way to the public, but then the public itself restores the intimate-now as relational and mutual rather than self-enclosed. It follows that if specific justice concerns economic and legal contracts it is answerable to a more general justice, which is for Aristotle none other than the life of paradoxically obligatory generosity and graciousness, where public statues ofthe Three Graces remind every citizen always to return favours with interest and to themselves offer endlessly new favours, which establish new reciprocal obligations. 13

For Aristotle, then, dignity is not something inert and altogether reserved. It must in part be reserved to ensure further giving in the future and protect against foolish lavishness. 14 But dignity much more consists in the operations of exchange through work and gift. Every exchange between incommensurable goods and roles, like that between a shoemaker and an architect, to give Aristotle's own prime example, involves an unmeasurable, ineffable, but real judgement of just exchange. 15

As Gallagher argues, Aristotle's reasoning here shows that if one begins by *admitting* the real social situation of difference and inequality, then one can seek to qualify this through an ethos that honours material benefactors. As today, the architect has more prestige than the shoemaker, according to virtue. Architecture is a more variously demanding and paradigmatically more architectonic role. Within this hierarchy, the shoemaker will, Aristotle contended, seek to gain a disproportionate benefit or 'profit' (which for Aristotle always denoted an excessive share in any transaction). Aristotle's solution here is to allow this imbalance to pertain, but to compensate this in terms of a greater 'honouring' of the higher party by both the beneficiary and the public at large. 16 Rather than the multi-billionaire's compensation for past iniquities of effectively coerced exchanging, we see generosity prepared always to raise the relatively poor in material terms met by an endless reconstrual of its own prestige in terms of a relatively immaterial honour. Human dignity as unequal and differential status paradoxically *promotes* human equalization, as Gallagher concludes his article.

For Aristotle, the exercise of dignity consists in the rendering of a social role *(leitourgia)* and performance of a social work *(ergon).* This is a measured generosity, entailing the internal, invisible reserve that is also an external, visible expressive act-the restraint of a reserved capacity for future giving

and relating as well as expressive reciprocity. The context for this exercise, or exchange, is the constitution of *diakosoune* (justice) within the *polis.* It is the city which integrates the external dignities of performed offices to form a functioning whole. And this functionalist understanding is qualified by the circumstance that the just city is itself defined as the open-ended sequence of personal relationships. 17

Nevertheless, Aristotle's integration of invisible and visible dignity remained imperfect. We see an unresolved tension between virtue and justice, *arete* and *diakosoune.* The aim of the best, aristocratic polity, according to Aristotle, is to produce virtue in its citizens. Yet virtue is defined by Aristotle in terms of an internal psychic balance of functions. This focus oti inward prudential integration, against exchange itself, creates a tension with justice. Further, justice itself can take on the idea of 'the division of labour' or the proper *remaining* of psychic functions and social roles in their fixed, hierarchic social places. Such an understanding could, as Plato discussed in the *Republic,* reduce reason *(nous)* to a superior *force* restraining the desires of the soul, just as the military restrains the working classes in the city. *Phronesis* could then become, as with the sophists, self-preservation and the smooth functioning of individual strength; justice in the city was the preservation of the city against external enemies. ·

Plato was more able to overcome these possibilities. For Aristotle, the ethical was a purely human and political affair; in consequence, true friendship only pertains between adult male participants in the political process. The Aristotelian city, composed of a network of reciprocities, does not extend beyond the city walls. But for Plato, practical wisdom was identical with the theoretical contemplation of transcendent goodness. We are good insofar as we relate to the divine, and we participate in the divine by communicating this goodness as adult men not just to other adult men (as for Aristotle) but also to women, children, and animals. Human friendship participates in the higher friendship of the gods to us and with each other. *Phronesis* consequently escapes the framework of a fixed hierarchic space (the city walls) in favour of time-the always fluid discerning of the right time and places for certain appropriate actions. 18

When we reach Cicero, however, we find that this aporetic split between inner and outer dignity (virtue and justice) was considerably magnified. On the one hand Cicero pointed towards a founding of order upon

the individual subject. On the other hand, towards a new sense of cosmopolitan order appealing beyond legality to the laws of nature and to shared human customs and reciprocities that had never been confined by the merely political. In terms ofthe notion of *axia* or *dignitas,* one can read this as a postpolitical division between a sheerly inward principle of reserve and a radically exteriorized principle in which 'polity' is newly extended to coincide with cosmos. Stoicism was the philosophy which articulated this split: dividing the ethical between an apathetic indifference of the individual on the one hand, and a dutiful submission to the public demands of *leitourgia* or *officium* on the other.

Cicero's *De Officiis* is fundamentally ambivalent as to the relationship between an internal dignity of reserve or resignation and an external dignity of right action. This book, he said, concerns the lesser wisdom of practical involvement. 19 In that sense, the dignity of office which he discusses would seem to be a dignity of *decus* or of outward fittingness. However, he argues that this is guided by a relatively inward *honestum.* Even though this term itself has etymological connotations of an outwardly facing honour (as Aquinas later emphasizes), 20 as compared with the pure reserve of genuine wisdom, *honestum* is something like a severe adherence to duty.21 Cicero continues in a traditional way to insist that no genuine *decorum* and even no genuine *utile*  can be independent of *honestum.22* However, he always protests too much, because he is uneasily aware that he is in danger of splitting the two apart

This ambivalence allows a certain opening towards modem ethical duality. Cicerp begins to suppress teleology in favour of a contrast between duty *(officium)* and utility *(utile).* For him, a perfect coincidence of duty with outcome is achieved by the attitude of inward resignation precisely because of its *indifference* towards result. Wisdom fully coincides with the *utile* or 'expedient' because it unites a man with all the vagaries of cosmic fate. To take this stance is implicitly to reject Plato and Aristotle's teleological notion that virtues are habits which tend of themselves to certain outcomes rather than others-and which we may sometimes be forced to follow rather than merely expedient (utilitarian) outcomes.

In this, Cicero already threatened to make subjective right the foundation of political order. His proclamation of the *dignitas* of man *(sic)* as such is an advance over Aristotle insofar as this allows him to begin to envisage the achievement of virtue by all, whatever their roles, and the duty of sympathy

with man as such. But this comes at the price of an abstraction, which in the long term will lead to empty liberal formalism. Like Aristotle, he allowed that there were pre-political communities involving justice and friendship. He agreed with the Greek philosopher that the basis of these communities lay not just in human beings fulfilling their material needs but also in enjoying friendship. However, unlike Aristotle he declared (no doubt in conditions of increasing international anarchy) that the specific reason for the founding of city-states was the securing of private property.23 In his insistence on the absoluteness of the latter (later criticized by St Augustine), the general wrongness of theft even in dire need, and the non-commutability of debts, Cicero comes across as proto-liberal and proto-capitalist.24 His internationalism is already predicated upon a respect for person and property that begins to equate the two. In this instance, the practical translation of the deontological axis of his political thought, as later in the end with Kant, is the sacralization of private ownership. Sacralization, because political duty now refers to property as axiomatic *principium* instead of according property on just and principled lines as granted on certain conditions and in relation to the performance of certain responsibilities.

### The Christian mediation between interior and exterior dignity

Following this trajectory, we face the following question: is it possible to affirm the dignity of human beings in universal and yet effectively concrete terms, and thereby to hold together absolute invisible value with specific visible valuation?

In order to do so, one must ensure that citizenry of the *cosmopolis* is not given simply by natural birth outside cultural and political relation. In doing so, Cicero seemed to shift from a concern for ethical character to the givenness of the mere individual and his 'own'. Nevertheless, Christian theology was able to adopt and borrow from Cicero (among other sources) his understanding of character as *persona.* As for Aristotle, Cicero saw 'personhood' as arising in part from universal human nature, in part from natural aptitudes, in part from accorded social role, and in part from habitual personal effort.25

In this respect, *persona* in Cicero would seem to mediate between invisible and visible in a way that *dignitas* fails to do. It is therefore fascinating

<sup>23</sup> Cicero, *On Duties,* II, xxi, 73; xxii, 78.

<sup>24</sup> Cicero, *On Duties,* II, xxiv, 94; III, vi, 2S-:-31.

<sup>25</sup> Cicero, *On Duties,* I, xxx, 107; xxxii, 115.

to realize that in some medieval texts these two terms become practically synonymous.26 This implies that now 'axiomatic' value had been accorded to 'personhood', a notion presupposing a merging of universal natural birth with cultural and political birth. And for this in turn to have become possible there had to emerge a political society that understood itself from the outset and intrinsically as cosmopolitan. For then universal citizenry ceases to be merely formal and abstract, without thereby sinking back into the atavistically particular.

This new universal polity was, of course, the *ecclesia,* the Church. Here there was a city without earthly walls in which, in consequence, the network of friendship (agapeic-erotic) is truly open-ended and indeed infinite, even though membership is constituted by an always specific if dynamic and fluctuating (both horizontally and vertically) emplacement. Thus StAmbrose was able to rewrite and qualifY Cicero's *De Officiis* in newly ecclesiastical terms.27

Through the *ecclesia,* citizenry is now personhood and personhood citizenry: at once cosmic, social, and mystical-liturgical. The dignified status of human existence as such has become 'personal' because we play the role, wear the mask (the original meaning of *persona)* of God, who is himself personal and interpersonal, and in whose image we are created. Aquinas, in contrast to liberal thought which seeks to guarantee universality by reaching for a universal status behind any performed role (the rational human individual, for example), prefers to run with original etymology by conceiving a universal and cosmic drama where the authentic remains the merely assumed. He sustains the close new association of *dignitas* with *persona,* and mediates the notion of dignity by treating the category of *persona* as itself something that analogically shifts between natural and social status. He declares that *persona*  originally meant the mask of high-ranking persons in classical plays, then was transferred to mean high-ranking dignitaries in the Church, and was finally applied to the high role played by all human beings. That this exalted status is nevertheless an assumed role is guaranteed by the fact that Aquinas thinks we may legitimately kill those who have effectively surrendered their humanity.28 As with Aristotle, the ontological remains pragmatic: if we no longer perform human works, then we literally *are not* or are only vestigially human, at least as far as the other human eye can discern.

However, relationship to God as constitutive of the human person can seem to betoken another mode of refusal of outward dignity. If we are to

#### 200 *John Milbank*

honour humans as being in the image of God, then surely we are never honouring human beings as such, only God through human beings, and maybe through their most interior aspect of reason. Protestant Christianity has often expressed this sort of idea. But Aquinas refuses it: just as a sign to be a sign must also be something in itself, so also an image to be an image must be a reality in its own right. So if human beings are fit to be in the image of God, then they can be accorded honour for a dignity that they possess in a certain sense as properly their own.29 The logic of the image therefore tends to integrate invisible and visible dignity; we must first 'stay with' the image in order to 'pass through' it to God.

Moreover, the notion of iconicity that is here involved disallows the disjunction of inward reason from outer corporeality through which character shines forth: each person in their face and body radiates a scintilla of the divine wisdom. In concrete terms, this means that a messy, suffering, human body can be in an evil-suffused world the most potent witness to human dignity. Or the dignity with pathos of the innocent, wondering, receptive child. (It is extraordinary that Michael Rosen thinks that children do not possess dignity when their unselfconsciousness ensures they can possess it far more naturally than can adults. 30)

This sense of personhood and dignity as the performing of a role, whether cosmic or cultural, continues in the Christian tradition, lying notably at the heart ofPico della Mirandola's treatise, posthumously entitled *Oration on the Dignity of Man. 31* It is erroneous to imagine that this work pre-announces a modem liberal constructivism, because its entire *tapas* and conclusions are all anticipated in writings of the Church Fathers. Humanity is a *Proteus:* lacking any specific attribute of his own, his specificity is paradoxically to combine in himself, at the centre of the cosmos, the material, animate and spiritual, along with the ruling, knowing, and loving functions of the three angelic orders of the Thrones, Cherubim, and Seraphim. Between all these attributes he is free to choose. This is in part indeed a matter of creative construction with respect to the operation of natural magic, but herein our co-creation with God is as much a matter of discovery as invention, as we both shape and release hidden natural powers. This 'Renaissance' dimension ofPico's work is itself unfolded in wholly orthodox Catholic terms, but at the heart of human choice lies for him a more traditional selection of our destiny among pre-given locations. Our real dignity is our capacity to elect to be united in the love of the

<sup>29</sup> Thomas Aquinas, *Summa Theologiae,* II.II. q. 101, a.3 ad 3.

<sup>30</sup> Rosen, *Dignity,* 77.

<sup>31</sup> Giovanni Pica della Mirando1a, *Oration on the Dignity of Man,* trans. Francesco Borghesis et a!. (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2012).

Cherubim to God. And while this is our highest destiny, it can in reality only be granted to us by God as an act of grace.

So for Pico, human dignity lies finally in the divinely gracious gift. Dignity is something that we are granted, that we have borrowed. Since we do not possess dignity in ourselves or because of any inalienable property, it would seem questionable, for this outlook, to locate dignity in the conception of a human being as 'an end in itself', as does Kant. By contrast, for Christian tradition, human beings as divine images are more fundamentally means for other human beings to pass with them but also through them to God. Nor are we ends to ourselves, but rather destined for the contemplation of God, while the human race as a whole is a means first to display and then to restore the divine glory.

As in the case of right divorced from status, it can seem that the Kantian conception is far more likely to secure human dignity than any notion which confines human beings to means, in however refined a way. Is not Kant ensuring that human beings can never be treated as commodities or instruments? But to the contrary, the idea of the human being as in himself a dignified *principium,* a first and final reality, is merely the reverse aspect of the reduction of everything, including human beings *qua* workers, to commodity status. For the fungibility of *everything else* requires that the owning subject be absolutely non-fungible, non-exchangeable, entirely free for the mere sake of freedom, in order that his property-owning be freed of every condition, however honourable. The human subject who can never be treated as a means to an end that exceeds him is a subject that transcends all shared social purpose, but a subject that *qua* occupier of a social office can be (along with the commodified material earth) *all the more exploited* if ethics cannot be concerned with the discrimination of appropriate and inappropriate mediations which human beings can perform and be subject to.

### An inheritance: corporatism *and* personalism

This emphasis on the dignity of role, understood in terms of personhood, continued through to Catholic social teaching in the nineteenth century, and still continues to this day. Indeed, this continuation could be described as a complementary union of corporatism and personalism.

It is wrong to say that Catholic corporatism contained no personalist dimension, or that the dignity of the group was entirely disconnected from the dignity of the person (even in the nineteenth century). Moyn is right that Catholic thought during the 1930s and the 1940s gradually moved from a

corporatist stress on the dignity of groups (notably in its fascist version) to a personalist stress on the dignity of the individual.32 Nevertheless, it would have been impossible to speak of the dignity of labour, in the nineteenth-century corporatist mode, without invoking the dignity of the human person. The dignity oflabour announces that labour is an authentic way to be human-not to be a labourer, which would be tautologous.

The dignity of the human being as such was less spoken of in this era. This is because neo-Thomistic thought, in keeping with both Aristotle and Aquinas, did not think of human universality as something that could be atomically and empirically instanced as an abstract property that is literally the same and equal in all. Such is the approach of liberalism, tending towards valuing the person as an abstract bearer of free will. Rather, 'human' was understood as something always analogically differentiated in various conditions of life, including diversity of gender, talent, and ascribed and elected social role. In other words, Catholic social teaching realistically considered that it would be vacuous to focus in practice on the dignity and rights of human beings as such, and not on the several dignities of human being in their various functions as they actually are in the specifically modem world.

In respect of any consequent shift towards personalism, corporatism may have been more muted in Catholic social teaching and practice since the Second World War, but it has never gone away. In recent papal social teaching, the stress on the vocational and its (non-liberal) political relevance has been paramount. The doctrine of subsidiarity remains corporatist, since it seeks to devolve central sovereign powers to groups which are vocational as well as voluntary, with groups regarded as interlocking in function and as contributing to the flourishing of the political whole.

Further, and contra Rosen, Catholic social thought has never abandoned its predication upon metaphysical and social hierarchy. Subsidiarity is clearly a hierarchical doctrine, since it teaches that political, social, and economic functions should be fulfilled at the most appropriate levels, and preferably at the lowest ones. Such a conception assumes that there is a socio-political pyramid with rule at the top only authenticated by its guardianship of the common good under both divine grant and popular assent. (Derivation only from the latter, as with liberalism, has *never* been papally conceded.)

Indeed, we have never abolished and *could* never abolish dignity as hierarchical status in favour of dignity as equal human worth based on right. To try to do so is instead to give more worth to the ever more worthless. It remains a mystery to our media commentators and to many academics that Britain, since

the 1950s, has become less deferential, yet more economically and socially unequal. They are unable to see the obvious: namely that a collapse in deferential respect for the dignity of representative status and virtuous achievement *necessarily* results in increased inequality because *axia* will not tolerate a vacuum: where worth is no longer regarded, only money retains any value.

Against this, we can only acclaim human dignity as universal human talent and capacity for wisdom, love, and grace, and seek to elevate all in these respects, if we accord also more honour to those in whom these things are more expressed and realized, and diverse honours to the diverse but equally necessary modes of living dignified lives. To do so is the precondition for requiring that those so honoured go on giving to the community, in every sense, more than is expected from others.

Personalism and corporatism have, accordingly, always been complementary rather than in tension with each other. The simple core of corporatism, at one with Christian political thinking, entails a rejection of the separation of political from socio-economic powers. To nurture the person one must nurture social groups and economic vocations. In order to widen personal political participation or democracy, one must ensure that every individual can exercise political influence through the workplace and with those with whom he shares a common purpose.

It might seem as if stressing the dignity of a person's role would run the danger of subordinating her to her function for the social organism. However, the Aristotelian and Thomistic tradition, inherited through Catholic social teaching, defines the purpose of the social and political whole as securing reciprocal justice and the always specific virtuous flourishing of each of its members. Indeed, one can turn the tables on liberalism here: if we mainly respect a man as a man *per se,* then this formalism can readily turn out to be compatible with all and every exploitation of him *qua* worker, son, father, and so on .. In consequence, these functions do indeed get reduced to merely instrumental functions of a machinic totality. Functions cease to be personally infused if, with false idealism and piety, we try to divorce personhood from function or, better, from 'role'.

We are left then with a final question: How is one to square these conclusions with the very evident embrace of liberal democracy by the Catholic Church and the papacy since the Second World War?

Three comments are in order here: first, there is a genuine and valid recognition that liberalism does, indeed, especially given a poor degree of consent about the common good, afford some protection against the worst intrusions upon the freedoms of some by the freedom of others. It is mature and balanced to say that liberalism offers a certain political good, but that this remains insufficient. Second, modem Catholicism tends to read individual rights in personalist terms, which regard the individual not in isolation but as the most basic rung in a subsidiarist vision that is in continuity with older distributist notions. What an individual can do for herself, own for herself, grow for herself, make for herself, she should. Inversely, she should be able to appeal against an oppressive group, just as a group has the right to appeal against an oppressive higher body and ultimately the state. The state itself should sometimes kenotically reach down to protect the individual person against the group, or smaller groups against greater ones, as in the protection of small businesses against greater ones and against monopoly. This was traditionally the populist argument for the need for monarchy as against merely aristocratic power: the One must sometimes defend the Many against the virtuous Few turned corruptly oligarchic.

But the third comment is to recognize that indeed some Vatican II documents did concede too much to liberal democracy.33 This was understandable, given the reaction to totalitarianism and the apparently optimistic prospects for this ideology in the early 1960s. Neither the growth of a brutal economic neoliberalism, nor the rise of a cultural liberalism that would eventually threaten the very character of our shared human existence was envisaged. It is, however, clear that papal and the most sophisticated academic Catholic thought has gradually backed away from this excessive embrace.

At times, papal and other Catholic writings seem to adopt the language of rights in liberal, Kantian terms, which would suggest a grounding in autonomy, with dignity redundant as ground if also invoked as a supplement. This results sometimes in contorted attempts to defend the unborn and the dying in terms of a rights-talk that is predicated upon the autonomy of the adult human. (And it has to be added here that sometimes a rights perspective leads bizarrely to an *excessive* conservatism in these areas, which is more restrictive than the usual medieval positions-for example with respect to abortion.) However, perhaps more frequently, rights are fortunately so qualified by the modem Catholic Church as scarcely to mean rights in the modem sense at all.34 They are deemed to correlate with the equally foundational duties of others, or else to coincide with equally foundational obligations of the rights-holder. One is led to the view that, in the face of the dominance of the human rights agenda

Calo, 'Catholic social thought, political liberalism and the idea of human rights', *Journal of Christian Legal Thought* (Fall, 2011), 1; Christopher McCrudden, 'Legal and Roman Catholic conceptions of human rights: convergence, divergence and dialogue?', *Oxford Journal of Law and Religion* 1 (2012), 185-201.

(and the frequently noble causes that it espouses), the Catholic Church tends apparently to adopt it, but in reality smuggles in ancient objective *ius* under the guise of modem subjective right. In substantive terms this means that it is indeed allowed that one can have a legitimate subjective claim to an objective *ius,* but not that such a *ius* is *ever* derived from human self-willing alone, even if the adjudication of rights accords (as did Aquinas, and more than Aristotle) such a capacity a high moral and legal relevance.35

The essential continuity of modem Catholic social teaching suggests that the alliance of rights with dignity, adopted after 1948 but arguably now under question, is an unnatural one. For if before 1948 secular rights discourse almost never mentioned dignity, then equally Catholic dignity discourse scarcely mentioned rights in the modem subjective sense. It follows that perhaps the most crucial remaining question mark over the post-war liberal-tending legacy in Catholic thought remains to do with human rights. In reality, the rejection of liberalism by Catholic thought with respect to issues of life, death, sexuality and gender does not indicate a residual disagreement with liberalism in just these areas, nor a 'different' Catholic understanding of subjective right, but rather exposes to view the fact that Catholicism, and its development of'dignity', remains at bottom incompatible with liberal notions of rights and democracy. The Catholic Church would be far better able to explain itself, and to explain the genuine core radicalism (after some needed theoretical pruning) of its positions in these areas, if it consistently abandoned rights in favour of dignity and criticized the abuses of justice consequent upon the hegemony of rights with respect to more political and economic issues also. This would expose to view what has always secretly been the case: that 'rights' and 'dignity' stand for two radically opposed political philosophies, and indeed for the two *most* opposed political philosophies: the politics ofthe modems and the politics of the ancients.
