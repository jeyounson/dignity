# **Socia-Economic Rights, Basic Needs, and Human Dignity: A Perspective from Law's Front Line**

#### *Conor Gearty*

IN THIS CHAPTER, I reflect on how the idea of human dignity works in British law. My starting point will be three relatively recent cases, in each of which the underlying idea of dignity was certainly present but unable (as we shall see) to do the kind of work that might be expected of such a powerful moral notion. In the second part, I will think about why this was so, and argue that the relatively subsidiary (or, indeed, non-existent) role played by dignity even in cases such as these (in which the dignity of each of the claimants was so obviously engaged) is the right approach for the judges to have taken. In other words, I will be saying that the term is too vague and uncertain to be able to be effective on its own via judge-made law alone. I will be contrasting political and legal conceptions of dignity, and arguing that the idea belongs more in the former than the latter arena-at least so far as Britain is concerned. It follows that I am opposed to too much dignity-talk in British law, and will explain why as best I can in this second section. In the third and final part, I describe the way in which I believe the principle of human dignity can best be realized in our legal system via (as I shall argue) a combination of a legislative emphasis on particulars combined with a careful judicial deployment of the language of human rights. These two operate together to provide a better way for the term to do its work than through the sort of judicial short cut that is opened up by the notion of a constitutional right to human dignity, or some such equivalent guarantee.

In what follows I should be clear that I am talking only about Britain, though it may be that the points I make have a more general application. I feel that they do, but I leave to others more specialist than I to judge the extent to which the general principles developed here can be considered to have a wider reach. In saying this I am not (only) reflecting the modesty of my aims; I am making an indirect point about the seductiveness of 'going global' with one's

views about dignity, of being tempted into regarding the conclusions one has drawn from one's own experience as necessarily of universal application-a particular risk so far as an abstract concept like dignity is concerned.

#### Three cases

The appellant in the first of our cases, *R (McDonald) v London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea,* 1 had once been 'the prima ballerina of Scottish ballet' .2 In September 1999, when aged fifty-six, she suffered a severe stroke, and this left her with limited mobility as well as other disabilities. Just short of seven years later, she fell, breaking her hip in several places, and further falls led to further periods of hospitalization. The problem 'at the centre of these proceedings', however, related to the fact that she suffered from 'a small and neurogenic bladder which makes her have to urinate two to three times a night'. 3 In the words of the judge who gave the lead opinion in the case, Lord Brown:

> Up to now she has dealt with this by accessing a commode with the help of a carer provided by the respondent Royal Borough as part of a package of care services to ensure her safety. For some years past, however, the respondents have been proposing instead that the appellant should use incontinence pads or special sheeting (hereafter 'pads') which would avoid the need for a night-time carer. The respondents say that this would provide the appellant with greater safety (avoiding the risk of injury while she is assisted to the commode), independence and privacy, besides reducing the cost of her care by some £22,000 per annum. The appellant, however, is appalled at the thotJght of being treated as incontinent (which she is not) and having to use pads. She considers this an intolerable affront to her dignity. Whether nighttime care can be provided on this revised basis is the critical issue in these proceedings. 4

The Supreme Court, by a majority, and upholding an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal, found that it could. The respondent authority had not acted unlawfully in assessing the appellant's needs, and while '[t]here is, of course, a positive obligation under article 8 [of the European Convention on Human Rights5) to respect a person's private life ... it cannot plausibly be argued

that such respect was not afforded here' .6 Nor did the submissions rooted in recently passed disability discrimination legislation upon which the appellant relied convince the majority, a 'hopeless' argument as Lord Brown rather brutally described it. 7

The dissenting opinion came from Baroness Hale of Richmond, the only woman on the bench (and still the only woman on the Supreme Court). The 'really serious question' raised by the case was whether it is 'lawful for a local authority to provide incontinence pads (or absorbent sheets) for a person who is not in fact incontinent but requires help to get to the lavatory or commode?' 8 Eschewing the argument as it had unfolded in the case before her, Lady Hale chose 'to address the question we might have been asked' ,9 namely whether an earlier House of Lords decision allowing resources to be taken into account in relation to decisions like this was good law. 10 But even without tackling that precedent, a way of supporting the appellant could be found via traditional public law: the local authority's insistence on regarding her as having a need different from that which she really had was *Wednesbury* unreasonable. 11 The United Kingdom was not a place where 'we ... oblige people who can control their bodily functions to behave as if they cannot do so, unless they themselves find this the more convenient course'. 12 This was because '[w]e are, I still believe, a civilized society' .13 Furthermore, the majority opinion may well produce a downward slide towards the wholly unacceptable:

> A person in [the appellant's] situation needs this help during the day as well as during the night and irrespective of whether she needs to urinate or to defecate. Logically, the decision of the majority in this case would entitle a local authority to withdraw this help even though the client needed to defecate during the night and thus might be left lying in her faeces until the carers came in the morning. This is not Ms McDonald's problem at the moment, but her evidence leaves one in no doubt that this is one of her fears. Indeed, the majority view would also entitle an authority to withdraw this help during the day. The only constraint would be how frequently (or rather how infrequently) it was deemed necessary to change the pads or sheets, consistently with the avoidance of infection and other hazards such as nappy rash. The consequences do not bear thinking about. 14

This comment provoked a strong reaction from Lady Hale's colleagues. 15 At the heart of this case was the question of how far ideas of dignity (or indeed, more to the point here, indignity) should be allowed to drive the analysis, forcing the law into a shape that worked better from a dignified perspective. Here was not a person whose lack of consciousness was an issue and whose dignity could be challenged on this basis: Ms MacDonald knew exactly what was going on. 16 Lord Brown's description of the facts acknowledges the appellant's view that she has suffered 'an intolerable affront to her dignity' and Lady Hale talked about our being 'still ... a civilised society'. The majority allowed dignity little leeway for intrusion, whereas Lady Hale placed it centre stage--and it is worth noting that the 'it' here is not so much the appellant's view of her treatment as Lady Hale's (objective) assessment of it (and her judgement as to where it might lead). Since the meaning of dignity was not exclusively determined (or even overly influenced) by the appellant's view of her plight, her problem ended up being that only one judge was sufficiently affronted on her behalf to force dignity to the forefront of the legal analysis of the case, driving (as dignity tends to do) all before it. For the remaining four, dignity (whatever the view they might take of its absence on the facts before them) was hidden from sight by the legal scaffolding that surrounded the case by the time it reached their court.

Now the second decision, a case in which I myself appeared as an advocate, just before Christmas 2011, *DM v Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Counci/. 17* Here, an aged wife found that as a joint account holder she was being charged for the cost of care given to her husband in a care home into which he had been placed under powers of compulsion first introduced in 2007 (as a result of a European Court of Human Rights ruling as it happens ). 18 DM argued that it was unfair that she and her husband should find their whole life savings being dissipated to pay for the costs of accommodation that was desired by neither of them, especially when such costs would have been met by the State had the husband been either sectioned under mental health legislation and/or released from such a sectioning into after-care accommodation. 19 In a careful judgment, Mr Justice Langstaff located the basis for the costs squarely in the legislation under scrutiny, which was made up not only of the

recently enacted deprivation of liberty laws but also the National Assistance Act of 1948, under which it had been provided that care be generally paid for by those who receive it where it had been sought from the local authority by someone who could afford it.20 The judge found no foundation in law for rewriting the legislation to bring it into line with the imperative of nondiscrimination that had been identified on the claimant's behalf.

There being no legal space for it, dignity could not be mentioned in court, but it was implicitly manifest throughout the proceedings. Here was a couple, married for some sixty years, whose last years were now to be blighted by separation and penury. On the other hand, the paying provisions dating from 1948 had been partly introduced in order to assure dignity to those forced by circumstance to rely on state support, the idea being that they would be thereby able to retain that level of independence that was judged by our then legislators to be an important part of their sense of self. Here we have a very good example of what Paolo Carozza has described as 'the way that participation in political life, in a very substantive sense ... (arguing, voting, organizing, persuading, legislating) is constitutive of our understanding of dignity' .21 In 1948, dignity was thought to require an obligation to pay, whereas in 2011, what I was trying (obliquely and unsuccessfully) to get the judge-Baroness-Hale-like-to foreground was a different kind of dignity, one that saw payment not as a route to dignity but rather an affront to it. But why should my advocate's vision of what was required trump that of Parliament? Did it make a difference that it was a legislative act of so long ago? If we were to have had a right to dignity available, which version of the term's meaning would (or should) have mattered more, that of 1948 or one more amenable to the minds of today (or at least my kind of mind of today)?

Now the third decision, the very well-known assisted 'right-to-die' case of *R (Purdy) v Director of Public Prosecutions.22* In all discussion of this case outside the courtroom the emphasis is on dignity and dying. But when the case reached the House of Lords (as the UK's supreme judicial body then was), their le>rdships hardly mentioned dignity at all: their concern revolved around the much narrower points of, first, the remit of s 2( 1) of the Suicide Act 1961 and, second, the extent to which the respondent in the case before them (the DPP) was obliged as a matter of law to construct an offence-specific policy setting out the factors that should be taken into account by him and his team in deciding whether or not it was in the public interest to bring a prosecution

under this section, in the event that assisted suicide of the sort being contemplated by the appellant and her husband were carried out.23 Resiling from an earlier collective ruling (in *R (Pretty) v Director of Public Prosecutions24),*  their lordships now took the view that the guarantee of the right to respect for privacy in article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (implemented across the UK in October 2000) encompassed within it a right to respect for just this sort of life and death decision. It followed that Ms Purdy and her husband were entitled to have this right to respect for their privacy taken into account when decisions were being made by the DPP as to what to do about their proposed actions by way of enforcement of the criminal law.

The difference between the two decisions was not just seven years (which in this field of seemingly fast-changing moral attitudes is a long time) but also the Strasbourg court's ruling in the *Pretty* case when the matter had reached it, to the effect that its judges were 'not prepared to exclude' the application of article 8. This was because the applicant before them was 'prevented by law from exercising her choice to avoid what she considers will be an undignified and distressing end to her life'. 25 The Strasbourg court had even gone so far as to stress that 'The very essence of the Convention is respect for human dignity and human freedom' .26 Despite all this, and to the untrained eye perhaps surprisingly, neither in *Pretty* in Strasbourg nor in *Purdy* in the House of Lords did the supplicants get any kind of mandate to act on their perceived moral imperative, *Pretty* because the restrictions imposed by law on those who assist suicide were judged (in the language of article 8) 'necessary in a democratic society ... for the protection of the rights of others'; and in *Purdy* because all that was being sought was an order to the DPP to produce guidance on his prosecution policy (on which point, certainly, Ms Purdy was successful). So while dignity may have underpinned the right before each court, adding impact to it, it remained in the background, a source of/explanation for a right rather than a right itself. And because it was 'only' a principle behind a right in this way, the fact that the right could be qualified did not mean that dignity was being ignored or that indignity was being imposed. Having jumped forward to give the Convention right energy, dignity fell back into the shadows and so was able to avoid seeming to have been rejected. This is as it should be. As with the *McDonald* and *DM* cases, dignity is not something we should be casually seen to be disregarding, whereas the right to privacy-with its

qualifications and acceptance therefore of proportionate intrusions-could be much less damagingly overridden.

# Against justiciable dignity

Matthias Mahlmann has asked an interesting question about the 'conditions for the usefulness of a legal concept' _27 One such requirement that strikes me as immediately relevant is a correct level of specificity. Here is Christopher McCrudden on human dignity, summarizing his path-breaking *Human Dignity and the Judicial Interpretation of Human Rights* (first published in July 2008):

> The Universal Declaration on Human Rights was pivotal in popularizing the use of 'dignity' or 'human dignity' in human rights discourse. This article argues that the use of' dignity', beyond a basic minimum core, does not provide a universalistic, principled basis for judicial decision-making in the human rights context, in the sense that there is little common understanding of what dignity requires substantively within or across jurisdictions. The meaning of dignity is therefore context specific, varying significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and (often) over time within particular jurisdictions. Indeed, instead of providing a basis for principled decision-making, dignity seems open to significant judicial manipulation, increasing rather than decreasing judicial discretion. That is one of its significant attractions to both judges and litigators alike. Dignity provides a convenient language for the adoption of substantive interpretations of human rights guarantees that appear to be intentionally, not just coincidentally, highly contingent on local circumstances. Despite that, however, I argue that the concept of 'human dignity' plays an important role in the development of human rights adjudication, not in providing an agreed content to human rights but in contributing to particular methods of human rights interpretation and adjudication.28

I will pick up and elaborate on the final sentence here in the third part of this chapter: like McCrudden, I believe in the underlying power of the language of dignity when localized and stripped of any direct reach into the facts before a court.

Both McCrudden and Michael Rosen in his recent book29 write about the 1975 and 1993 decisions of first West Germany's and then Germany's

top constitutional court on the question of the consistency of the state's abortion law with its constitution, a basic law that (unusually) contains an explicit guarantee of dignity that is not capable of being altered or deviated from. 30 On both occasions the court has turned to this language of dignity to guide it to its conclusion. But as McCrudden has remarked, ' [ o ]nee dignity entered the balancing calculus on the side of the life interest, the conclusion that the protection of the foetus's life must receive priority over the women's freedom was inevitable' .31 And according to Rosen in 1993, the court 'affirmed its previous position in equally forceful language' when it declared that human dignity was 'already an attribute of unborn human life, not just human life after birth or with a developed personality' .32 But then what happened? Here is Rosen's summary:

> The court's rigoristic stance regarding the extension of human dignity to foetuses at all stages of development is strongly out of line with German public opinion. A 2005 poll showed 64 per cent of the German public agreeing with the statement 'If a woman does not want children, she should be able to have an abortion' ... The outcome has been a remarkable compromise ... The court, while re-affirming that abortion is illegal *(rechtswidrig)* has nevertheless accepted that abortion should not be punishable *(strajbar)* provided that it takes place in defined circumstances (generally, within the first twelve weeks and after the pregnant woman has participated in an independent counselling session).33

Now I would suggest that this is the sort oflegal manoeuvre likely to give dignity a bad name. It was not only that the court saw fit to impose its own view of dignity on the legislature-a body of elected representatives which had not, after all, set out to affront dignity but had wanted rather to reflect in the country's laws a different view of what the term was thought to entail. But it was also that, having done so, and faced with an immovable German opinion, the court wobbled, and compromised on what it had said dignity required. This is what happens when courts get involved in deciding what dignity is, treating it as a truth to be discovered and then imposed rather than a point of view to be argued for and deliberated on.34

I want now to introduce two ideas which I have already anticipated in part one and which are central to this chapter (and to which I return in part three). First, dignity cannot afford to be qualified in the way that other interests and

even human rights can be. Having identified what dignity entails, it cannot then be overridden by proportionate attacks on it, as ordinary rights can be. That is one of the reasons that judges steer clear of the term or downplay it. We don't-and *contra* Aharon Barak (to whom I return) shouldn't-think of dignity as something which people have conditionally, the way they have rights to free speech or privacy, which are however capable of being set aside in the interests of the community. To note briefly another German case, also in Rosen: that of Wolfgang Daschner, the deputy chief of police in Frankfurt who had threatened to subject a suspect to very severe pain if he did not reveal the whereabouts of a boy he was presumed to have kidnapped (and whom it was credibly believed would die if not found quickly).35 Even on such terrible facts, the relevant regional court convicted the police chief, albeit fining rather than imprisoning him. Once dignity is engaged, all bets are off (at least so far as culpability is concerned, whatever is thought about punishment). Second, there is this other feature of dignity-language: while there can be different versions of dignity, no deal can be done between them. The term is rooted in truth, not a passing point of view. Since there are these different meanings, and since they are not tradable, a decision has to be made between them-and so the key question is, who makes that decision? I don't think that, in the UK's democracy at least, it should be the courts. The German compromise stands as a very specific warning on this precise point, with the political version of what dignity entailed in relation to abortion standing outside the court's insistence on its perspective, a clumsy overlaying of a political on a constitutional truth.

Bujlding on these two points, let me now elaborate a little more on my objections to the idea of justiciable human dignity before turning in the final section to what I think of as the proper role of dignity in English/British law. Extreme affronts to dignity can be dealt with via prohibitions on torture, inhuman and degrading treatment, slavery, and the like; indeed, when Deputy Police-"Chief Daschner's case reached the Strasbourg court (on the application of the man who had been threatened with ill-treatment), it was as an orthodox human rights case that it was processed (albeit presenting, it is true, a most unusual set of facts). And importantly, it is exactly these prohibitions on torture, slavery, and so on (which we might call 'applied-dignity' rights) that come without exception or qualification. In contrast to these, stark ethical commands, there are the more general understandings of dignity, those not concerned with the crudities of torture or slavery or the like but designed as Paolo Carozza has put it to protect 'the human capacity for relationality ...

<sup>35</sup> Although as it transpired he was already dead. See *Giifgen v Germany* (20 I 0) 52 EHRR I.

and human flourishing' .36 These are best realized by rigorously focused legislative interventions aimed at supporting and protecting particularized aspects ofwhat dignity is thought to require. Neither of these approaches needs a justiciable language of dignity to make it work. Either the criminal law covering breach of a core negative human right (not to be tortured, and so on; not to be enslaved) does the business, or specific legislation focused on the good life achieves this outcome; neither need (or, I am tempted to add, should) mention dignity.

There is a middle ground which seeks to deliver dignity by producing neither specific legislation nor an overarching right to dignity as such but rather through enactment of a set of broadly based social and economic 'rights' which it then falls upon the courts to drive forward. This is attractive to many as a way of avoiding burdening the judges with 'dignity' issues, while at the same time depoliticizing the requirements of the good life, turning such necessities into entitlements to be asserted against political decision-makers, rather than matters of the importance of which these legislators need to be convinced. Certainly, social and economic rights are creatures of a vision of dignity which is attractive, focusing as it does on the universal entitlements to which we all should have access if we are to live successful (and therefore dignified) lives. But there are risks in this seduction.

The UK Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights has elaborated on what it has called the three 'most common objections' to the entrenchment in law of social and economic rights. 37 First it observed that social and economic rights would be 'too vaguely expressed' and would 'only raise expectations and encourage time-consuming and expensive litigation against public bodies' .38 Second, echoing McCrudden's remark already quoted, the move 'hands too much power to the courts and so is undemocratic'. 39 Third, such an adjudicative power would involve 'the courts in making decisions about resources and priority setting that they are ill-equipped to take'.40 Several additional points of objection can be added to these. There is, fourthly, the strong emphasis on the individual that is inherent in the whole idea of justiciability, with its inevitable focus qn particular claimants at the expense of the wider public interest. This might be laudable in the arena of traditional

litigation where two parties jostle to secure a reading of a specific law (or prior agreement) in their favour, but it fits less well when such proceedings are being regarded by one of the parties as a device through which to smuggle into court the interests of thousands of invisible claimants, however meritorious the moral arguments being made via their representative litigant might be. Judges are suspicious of 'test cases', not necessarily because they are opposed to the outcome that the litigant before them is pursuing on behalf of others so much as on account of the self-evident lack of fit between the narrow realm of such litigation and the broader issues that they are being asked covertly to deal with in such proceedings.

This mismatch is compounded, fifthly, by the inappropriateness of the adversarial model to the resolution of broadly framed issues of social and economic rights which go well beyond the litigant before the court. We have already seen that human dignity may not be controversial as an idea but what it entails undoubtedly is, and so I have argued that it is in the political realm that issues about the content of an agreed commitment to dignity should be played out. It is exactly the same with social and economic rights. The court is simply not the right site to decide these things at such a high level of abstraction, and the more you fiddle with its procedures to make it the right place (special briefs on the impact on the 'dignity' or 'social rights' of the individual ofthis or that change; advice from philosophers; readings from other jurisdictions on social and economic rights), the more any such tribunal looks less and less like a court and more and more like an executive office, but without the usual democratic necessities of electoral legitimacy and public accountability. And without a proper enforcement arm as well, a sixth objection to assigning the concretization of the meaning of dignity and/or social and economic rights to the judicial branch emerges. Who is to follow-up the court's decision to see that it has been effectively implemented? What happens when unexpected glitches in effecting a court's orders are encountered? We should recall here how the German system has accommodated the court's rulings on abortion but in a way that has involved the drawing of practical lines which have seemed at odds with the judges' apparently powerful rhetoric on dignity and on life.

A seventh objection is almost embarrassing to mention, so old-fashioned does it seem: beware of empowering judges lest you give them an aggressive tool with which to hinder (rather than to facilitate) progress. Human dignity in the hands of the rich can become an agent of reactionary defensiveness, mustered to preserve privilege under the guise of a natural entitlement. If proof were needed, we can reflect on how judges across what is now the democratic world greeted the advances--on votes for women; on workers' rights;

on race discrimination; on the restriction of property and contract rights-that made that democracy possible. 41 Sometimes the dignity of all tomorrow has required some unfairness today, in the form of affirmative action programmes and the like, designed to rectifY historic disadvantage. Reformers coming from outside the rights tradition would have no difficulty with this-of course the known few must suffer for the benefit of the future unknown many, and the fact that there is a withdrawal of the privileges of the minority now so as to assist in the future flourishing of all is of the essence of policy-making: this is exactly what planners ought to be doing. But to judges, schooled in the application of justice not by reference to broad societal goals but in accord with what precisely configured individual cases before them appear to require by reference to clear and enforceable laws, this seems a monstrous injustice. If they have the dignity weapon to hand, or even social rights that can trump the legislature, it may be impossible for them to forbear from their deployment.

# Doing dignity

Jeremy Waldron has spoken of dignity as a 'sort of value, or principle, or policy deeply ... within the law ... established like a legal principle or deep policy of the law, not laid down in any text, but something to which the legal system has committed itself to in the way it commits itself also to other elements of public morality in the way that we reason'.42 So in *McDonald,* 'one could imagine a court saying what [Waldron understands] Baroness Hale did say, that when we have to choose between two possibilities, even if we are not explicitly instructed to do so by the legislator, the role of dignity is as important as any other deep legal value, bubbling up implicitly pervasively in the law even if it's not textually mandated'. These are very helpful comments towards understanding what I believe to be the proper role of dignity in English law. There is a significant democratic dimension to this discussion, and it flows from what I have been saying in part two: visions of dignity already drive a very great deal of legislation, even if the legislation or even the debates preceding it are not framed in exactly this way, with the term merely, as Waldron puts it, 'bubbling up implicitly'.

One of the more distressing features of human rights lawyers is their tendency towards moral exclusivity; that without them ideas of dignity have

no space in the legal firmament, implicitly as well as explicitly. Indeed, when the agitation for a British bill of rights was at its height, in the early 1990s, it was sometimes as though the country's law had been immersed in an 'ethical aimlessness ' 43 which had taken no account of principle before the arrival of the human rights cavalry. Even with due allowance being made for the need to talk up the problems that were said to require new legislation, this was always something of an exaggeration. In fact, ideas of human dignity have played a large part in the creation of the Britain that we know and appreciate today. Examples of this are the National Assistance Act 1948, which figured in the *DM* case, and the national health legislation, which was engaged in *McDonald,* and even (I would also say) the Suicide Act, which was the source of the *Purdy* litigation. Writing a book in 2004 on the then fairly new Human Rights Act I devoted a chapter to the 'Principle of Human Dignity', which began with what I consciously regarded as a salute to the achievements of the democratic legislature:

> from the landslide election of Henry Campbell-Bannerman's Liberals in 1905, it could be said that the dignity of the person was, with the defence of the realm, one of the two great legislative preoccupations of the twentieth century. The famous Trades Disputes Act of 1906 made possible trade union activism which transformed the lives of many working men and women, and legislation of this type continued until the mid-1970s. Winston Churchill's initiatives on national insurance and hours of work in 1911 were similarly radical for their day ... Highlights in any such narrative would include the Education Act 1944, the National Health Service Act 1946, the New Towns Act 1946, all of which initiatives came with the radical impetus of war behind them, demanding a better deal for those who had taken such risks in combat, and for the families they had left behind at home ... The trend persisted into the immediate post-war period ... though other even bolder assertions of dignity were to follow, such as the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act, enacted in 1977.44

Just because something does not advertise itself as rooted in dignity does not mean that this is not the basic idea that informs it, 'bubbling up implicitly'. The social democratic vision of the person-flourishing within a community; part of but not slave to the market; respecter of property but not of needless accumulation; secure from 'cradle to grave' -comes out of a sense ofwhat it means to be a person, to lead a successful, a dignified, life.45 But as we have

seen in part two, there are other views of what dignity demands: the signifier floats not just in law but (especially perhaps) in politics as well. Thus, a different account of the human takes one down a path of autonomy and selfreliance, with richer readings of dignity playing second fiddle to demands for liberty and individual freedom; to such versions of what is essential, the 'cosseting' entailed in social democratic readings of dignity is anathema. The beauty of the democratic approach to dignity is that it manages the differences and resolves them, not in the form of a win for this or that approach but in the shape of several concrete versions of what dignity is found to entail, specific to particular moments and situations. Not only do these outputs not need the dignity label attached to them, they need not even be complementary: different versions of dignity can collide with each other, jostle against each other, contradict each other-all so long as none claims the prize of *true* dignity, for down that route lies an absolutism that does not fit with the contingency that is part and parcel of all parliamentary truth. This is a different kind of truth, the 'dignity oflegislation' as Jeremy Waldron has put it.46

And legislation can provide for human rights as well. This is what the UK parliament did when it enacted the Human Rights Act 1998 (the HRA). The purpose of this measure was to introduce the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms into domestic law. As we have seen, on the estimate of the Convention's own court (the European Court of Human Rights) this is a charter whose very essence is 'respect for human dignity and human freedom' .47 Despite the grandeur behind this informing ethic, there are to be found in this Convention few if any of the social and economic rights the judicial enforcement of which we saw in part two to be somewhat problematic. Nor did the parliament that enacted the largely civil and political rights that are present in the HRA intend itself or its successors to be bound by it. The Act contains no clause purporting to entrench itself in law for all time.48 It deliberately declines to empower judges to overturn Acts of Parliament on the basis of a conflict with the rights that are set out within it, the most that is achievable being an unenforceable 'declaration of incompatibility' which the executive and legislative branches are then bound to think about but not necessarily to act on. 49 So, just as in ordinary legislation, the version of dignity which finds expression in the language of human rights in the Convention (and therefore in the HRA) is in this important sense provisional: it is Parliament's best guess *at that moment* as to what dignity entails, and reflects its

judgement that the fleshing out of what dignity requires in this way will be invariably right-albeit (of course) it is an elaboration that is always reversible, either generally through repeal of the HRA or specifically by directly ignoring its provisions in specific instances.

Some well-known examples can serve as illustrations. In *R (Limbuela) v Secretary of State for the Home Department,50* the House of Lords held that the Home Secretary had an obligation to provide support for asylum seekers since not to do so and thereby to ensure their destitution (subject to charitable intervention) would amount to degrading or inhuman treatment, contrary to article 3 of the Convention. This was not some free-floating intervention by their lordships: the relevant statutory provision had specifically required that all state action be consistent with the Convention rights of those adversely affected by such executive decisionsY Where Parliament has not mandated such overarching intrusiveness, the courts are able only to issue their unenforceable declarations, even where the matter under consideration is such a serious intrusion into one's life as indefinite detention without charge (as in the Belmarsh detention case)52 or one's permanent listing on a sexual register without the possibility of review. 53 These are all cases engaging the idea of dignity, albeit (to say it yet again) indirectly via a particular right rather than as a right in itself. A last example, from Strasbourg this time, is the recent case of *MS v United Kingdom,* 54 in which prolonged detention in a police cell of a mentally ill man (beyond seventy-two hours) was found by the European Court of Human Rights to have breached his article 3 right not to be subjected to inhumane treatment, the Court noting that 'the mentally ill are in a position of particular vulnerability, and clear issues of respect for their fundamental human dignity arise whenever such persons are detained by the authorities'. 55

It might at this point be thought: why not go the whole hog, cut out the linguistic middle-man, and simply apply a right to dignity unhampered by all this needless rights-specificity? This takes us back to the critique in part two, of course. But it is also to misunderstand the role of rights language, in law if not in ethical life: talk of specific rights allows for a balancing that direct dependence on a right to dignity could (as I have earlier said) simply not afford to countenance. Whereas for many rights we are familiar with (and not offended by) the notion of a legitimized departure from its ethical demands

where this is judged to be (in the language of the European Convention) 'necessary in a democratic society' for this or that legitimate reason, or otherwise (to use another Europeanism) 'proportionate', the notion of our dignity being instrumentalized in this way is something that we would find hard to bear. This is why the Germans ended up with an absolute right to dignity: how can it not be unqualified in a civilized society? In contrast to this, in each of the cases with which we started *(McDonald, DM,* and *Pretty/Purdy),* the defeat of dignity was masked by the deployment of the language of human rights, coming as it did not only with assertions of right but with legitimate societal overrides as well. Fine-sounding though it is, an effect of taking a rights-based absolutist approach is to impose great pressure on the meaning of dignity, on the remit of the term itself, since there is a temptation to sneak in utility via a dilution in what we say the term embraces or requires. The German abortion issue comes to mind again in this regard. Something like this happens with the closest thing to dignity that traditional rights instruments have, the right not to be subjected to torture. or inhuman or degrading treatment, a right that is absolute in a dignity-like way and therefore does not have the sort of societal override that we saw in *McDonald, DM* and *Pretty/Purdy.* It has been precisely the lack of balancing in this provision so far as suspected international terrorists are concerned which has been the main cause of disgruntlement with the HRA in UK political circles. 56 And even where the issues are not this hot, as in the *MS* case just mentioned, controversy encircles such ethical dogmatism: the UK courts had found no breach of article 3 when the case had been before them, and a leading commentator in this jurisdiction has attacked the Strasbourg ruling as 'a prime example of using Article 3 as a social and economic right, not a basic civil right, and thus extended leaves publicly funded authorities to carry out difficult jobs with threats oflitigation looming on all sides'. 57

Of course, some might argue that it is not at all problematic to subject dignity to the balancing test deployed when considering whether to allow a right to this or that (free speech, say, or privacy) to be overridden by the more urgent of the exigencies of any given moment. I understand Barak to be taking this line, both in this volume and in his earlier work on proportionality. 58 On this account, there is no difficulty about even central ethical concepts like dignity and the prohibition on torture being subjected to a proportionality test,

under which their demands might be departed from if the situation is thought urgent enough. I disagree with this approach, not just because of the reasons rehearsed in this chapter but because of my concern that it would achieve exactly the opposite of what it intends, in other words that by providing a stop-gap override permitting torture, for example, and/or affronts to dignity, it would legitimize as right and proper what should always be regarded as outside the pale of civilized living. Indignity is not the same as discrimination, something we can justify in some cases while continuing to abhor in others. Nor is it like free speech, a guarantee that must yield from time to time to the greater public good. Dignity is about what we are as persons. In the German torture case, Daschner needed to be punished despite our empathetic understanding of his plight-the case was not just about its facts; it was about how we as a community treat people.

Law does not eliminate political argument, the debate about hard choices; it merely relocates these conflicts. Litigating dignity provides no true answers, just passing victories for this or that side. Of course, it could be validly said in response to this (and echoing Clemens Sedmak) that the vulnerable are left exposed. 59 This is true as a subset of a general point about democracy, that we are all as individuals at risk from majoritarianism. The task is to contribute to the achievement and/or preservation of a healthy dignity-respecting society, one in which all are well catered for. Now perhaps this might entail laws like the HRA, a measure that handcuffs future legislatures while giving them the key at the same time-hoping they will choose not to unlock themselves and do bad things, or that at least they will have second thoughts while reaching for the key and forcing it into the lock. But it is a liberal daydream to suggest that a culture going downhill to indignity can be other than briefly interrupted by a bench of judges waving some piece of paper as a reminder of what by now only they believe were 'better' days. Keeping us civilized is a democratic task. In the UK, and perhaps in every democracy, this is primarily the work of our elected representatives, not our judges. They must work out what they mean by dignity and then put it into effect, either specifically or through general 'human rights' legislation if this can be made to work (as arguably the HRA does, in the UK). Our job as democratic stakeholders is to fight for the vision of dignity in which we believe and not rely on others-even benign judges-to deliver it for us.
