# **The Concept of Human Dignity: Current Usages, Future Discourses**

#### *Bernhard Schlink*

#### Current usages

UNDERSTANDING HUMAN DIGNITY BEGINS with understanding the different usages ofthe concept of human dignity.

Human dignity is used as a flag under which people unite and fight for freedom, equality, and decent living conditions that enable them to take care of their needs. The flag summarizes and abbreviates what they are fighting for; respect for their human dignity to them means respect for their freedom, equality, and right to live under decent conditions, no less, no more.

Human dignity is also used as a foundational concept for human rights, as a concept that at least justifies and at best requires the existence of human rights. While the flag summarizes and abbreviates freedom, equality, and decent living conditions, that stand in and of themselves, the foundational concept is the basis without which human rights have no standing.

Human dignity is further used as a last resort, insisted upon when every other claim fails. The same person that understands that his or her claim for freedom, equality, and decent living conditions has no chance to succeed, and therefore gives up raising these claims, can still insist on respect for his or her human dignity, and challenge the ultimate humilation of being tortured or enslaved or broken for use in a show trial.

It is only a small step from using human dignity as the foundational concept for human rights to using it as a mother right, from which human rights are derived as daughter rights. Under Chief Justice Aaron Barak the Israeli Supreme Court pursued this approach with particular diligence. It developed a jurisprudence that regards human rights that are explicitly granted in most other constitutions, but not in the Israeli constitution, as protected by the Israeli constitution anyway-protected by the constitutional protection of human dignity as a mother right. The protection of human dignity as a mother right can only be relative. In conflicts and collisions between citizens, or between citizens and the state, human rights must be curtailed; for the daughter rights to be limitable, the mother right must be limitable as well.

But human dignity can also be an absolute right, used as a legal last resort exempt from all governmental and administrative curtailing, from all legislative give and take, from all proportionality considerations and balancing, from all utilitarian calculation. Under the German Constitution the protection of human dignity is understood as such an absolute protection. Since a constitution must allow for the curtailing of human rights, the absolute protection of human dignity can protect only some core elements of human identity and integrity.

We have these different usages not because we cannot agree on one usage, but because they serve different purposes, show up in respectively different contexts and documents, and rely on different philosophical traditions and conceptions.

When people unite and fight under the flag of human dignity, what matters to them is success: freedom, equality, and decent living conditions. Whether the respect for their human dignity is owed to them because of their value, for instance their value as beings created in God's image, or because of their status, for instance their equal status as contributors to the commonwealth, or because of rights granted to them by nature or reason, is of minor importance; whatever supports their fight is welcome, from Christian liberation theology and Marxist revolutionary ideology to any philosophy of liberte, egalite, and fratemite.

When the goal is to establish a foundation for human rights or to find a mother that gives birth to human rights that the constitution fails to protect explicitly, the realm of philosophical traditions and conceptions to build on is somewhat narrower, but still includes, among others, Thomas Aquinas, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

When the goal is to embue human dignity as a last resort and an absolute right that courts can enforce and the state will respect, it is an obvious move to tum to Kant, because he understands human dignity as an absolute that prohibits each and every instrurnentalization and requires to treat everybody as a subject and nobody as an object.

With these different usages and their different philosophical traditions and conceptions it is no wonder that the human dignitY discourse does not have one concept and conception of human dignity. One wonders whether there is even a need for one. Isn't it enough to be aware of the different usages and to know in what usage one is engaging?

Indeed, much oftoday's human dignity discourse can do without one, and even without any concept and conception of human dignity.

This becomes obvious when the discourse turns to specific problems and cases. The crucifix in the classroom, the teacher with a headscarf, religious sentiments that demand protection against anti-religious pronouncements, women's equality versus religious traditions, religiously required or supported polygamy, equal access to health care, the right to life, the right to die, assisted suicide, abortion, stem-cell research, how to implement equality after apartheid, how to deal with colonial or similar crimes of the past-whatever the topic is, today's discourse employs some human dignity rhetoric. But no important aspect of any of these problems and cases is lost when the discourse doesn't use this rhetoric and deals only with the specific rights and freedoms involved carefully and comprehensively. Using human dignity rhetoric may add some colour, but it doesn't add to unfolding and solving the problem or case.

There are exceptions. When the German constitution protects human dignity absolutely, it invites use as a trump card that ends human rights arguments. Once the card is played, we don't talk about the right of the pregnant mother versus the right of the unborn baby, the merits of stem-cell research versus its dangers, what torture yields and what damage it does, but whether the stem-cell and the unborn baby have dignity and whether torture is a violation of dignity. Another seeming, but not true, exception is Israel, where every freedom and equality issue has to be developed as a human dignity issue but is then dealt with as a mere freedom or equality issue. Where human dignity is not protected absolutely, human rights discourse doesn't benefit from human dignity rhetoric.

### Three reasons to hold on

So why do we keep engaging in human dignity discourse? Why do we hold on to the concept?

There are several good reasons to do so. The first is that human dignity discourse bridges the gaps between the different usages. Those who use human dignity as a political flag under which to unite and fight for freedom, equality, and decent living conditions, may not care about the philosophical traditions and conceptions of human dignity; all they want is success. But once the fight or the success become flawed, once the fight becomes about equality and neglects freedom, or the success is one of freedom without equality, the flag of human dignity can serve as a reminder that the fight was about

more, about a life in dignity, a life with freedom and equality and under decent living conditions. Similarly, the concept of human dignity can keep the idea of human rights rich and complex; once it is understood that human dignity can serve as the foundational concept for human rights, it follows that every aspect of a good life that is associated with human dignity must find its place in the system of human rights. And whatever the political agenda or legal system of human rights may be, it is important that they are confronted with the question whether they manage to fight off the ultimate humiliations that people experience as an assault on their last resort, their human dignity.

The second good reason is that there is actually an overlap between the different usages of human dignity and the different conceptions and traditions they build on. There is a common core. For all usages, human dignity is something that all humans share; it is indefeasible, it-we can phrase it positively-demands at least some basic respect for human autonomy, it-we can also phrase it negatively-prohibits at least ultimate humiliations.

This overlap or core has meaning, even though it is vague and its precise content is contested and disputed. I wish that everybody agreed that torture is one of the inacceptable and unconstitutional ultimate humiliations; unfortUnately this point is still being debated. But at least it has to be discussed as an issue ofhuman dignity and not just as an infringement ofbodily integrity, like vaccinations and haircuts for drafted soldiers.

There is a third good reason for holding onto the concept of human dignity. It is a *Sehnsuchtsbegriff,* a concept that encompasses our longing for a better and fairer world where the recognition and protection of humans is not up for grabs and cannot be overpowered or outmanoeuvred or. argued down. The longing, again, is vague, and it will never be fulfilled and will often be frustrated. But the concept is important. It brings together people of goodwill who all share that longing, . though they may disagree on what human dignity means, demands, and prohibits; whether it has religious connotations or is a completely secular concept; whether it builds on the idea of virtue, on individual autonomy, on social status, or on some other basis. The longing is something over which they can meet and join in at least some steps towards a better and fairer world.

#### Future discourses

There is enough common ground for interdisciplinary discourse on human dignity. Lawyers and particularly those who are or were justices tend to focus on results in a way that philosophers sometimes find reductionist, and philosophers tend to dig and dig into problems in a way that sometimes feels unfocused to a legal mind. But it is clear what both sides bring to the discourse: lawyers their real cases and legal problems, philosophers their reflections on what humans are and what they owe each other. Jurisprudence and legal scholarship meet anthropology and ethics.

With theologians it is difficult, and the difficulties surfaced in the discourse between philosophers, lawyers, and Catholic theologians at the conference. Of course, theologians can also bring to the discourse their reflections on what humans are and owe each other. But since lawyers seek solutions for their cases and legal problems that are acceptable to religious and nonreligious people alike, since lawyers and philosophers work under a secular premise, the specifically theological anthropological and ethical considerations are of limited interest.

What would be of interest Catholic theologians don't bring. The Catholic Church is an institution with a strong hierarchy, and strong instruments and routines of control, treating women and also gays and lesbians not as equals, demanding from its functionaries a chastity that often overburdens them, engaging in charitable institutions and activities that, like all charity, cannot do without an element of paternalism, nursing a culture of seclusion. That hierarchy, control, and paternalism are problems for autonomy and also for human dignity, that the rejection of equality is a problem for human dignity, that overburderning someone while at the same time giving him the opportunity to use paternalist dominance over the young and weak to relieve the burden creates problems for the human dignity of the young and weak, that a culture of seclusion is a problem when protecting human dignity against violations-all this is obvious. The scandals of the last decades show that the problems are real. As the challenges for human dignity that the state creates and that lawyers and philosophers and theologians discuss, looking at specific problems and cases, the challenges for human dignity within the Catholic Church and similar institutions, particularly but not exclusively of a religious nature, could equally be discussed interdisciplinarily. And both discourses could learn and profit from each other.

That the Catholic Church has its hierarchy, control, unequal treatment of women and others, celibacy, charitable paternalism, and culture of seclusiveness is not the issue. The issues are the dangers for human dignity that this creates; they have to be reflected upon and dealt with, not just as occasional accidents but as structural problems. The voice of the Catholic Church in the public discourse on issues of human dignity rings hollow when the issues of human dignity within the Church are not visibly reflected upon-as the structural problems that they are.

The future that one wishes the human dignity discourse to have would not only include the Catholic Church and its theologians in a deeper way but would also invite Jewish and Muslim contributions. It would ask what man's creation in God's image means for Jews and Christians alike and differently. It would ask the Muslim theologians what human dignity means to them and how they reconcile human dignity with the inequality of men· and women and believers and nonbelievers. It would have to be a discourse on human dignity and tolerance and on universalism and particularism. It could at least build on a universal longing for a better and fairer world.
