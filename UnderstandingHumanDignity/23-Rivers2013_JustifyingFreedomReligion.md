# **Justifying Freedom of Religion: Does 'Dignity' Help?**

#### *Julian Rivers*

### Introduction

LEGAL AND POLITICAL THEORISTS find freedom of religion intensely problematic. It is therefore not surprising that when judges find themselves interpreting and applying broad constitutional or human rights provisions protecting freedom of religion, the answers they give to fundamental questions of scope and justification are sketchy or non-existent. In its first case under article 9 ECHR, the European Court ofHuman Rights (ECtHR) describes freedom of religion as 'one of the foundations of a "democratic society'" .1 It is 'one of the most vital elements that go to make up the identity of believers' and also a 'precious asset for atheists, agnostics, sceptics and the unconcerned' .2 Although the case-law under the European Convention has developed extensively since that first decision in *Kokkinakis,* the ECtHR has hardly added to these preliminary foundational considerations. There is no doubt in the minds of the Strasbourg judges that freedom of religion is important, but exactly what it is and why it matters remains elusive.

Normative evasion is a familiar feature of US constitutional doctrine as well. There, the basic constitutional principles are well established, and it is possible to mask one's normative case in the guise of a purely descriptive account of religion. Given an unquestioned commitment to norms of nonestablishment and free exercise, all we need to do is determine what is to count as 'religion'. But the moment one abandons historic literalism as a proper approach to constitutional interpretation, it becomes a category mistake to suppose that a semantic definition drawn from sociology or anthropology can fulfil the purposes of political morality. The question which needs

answering is a composite one: what is religion for the purposes of our current constitutional principles of free exercise and non-establishment? Answering that question presupposes a normative theory.3 And such a theory can have a determining effect on how one views seminal decisions of the Supreme Court such as *Smith* on religious accommodations and *Hosanna-Tabor* on religious group autonomy.4

Without wanting to gloss over important differences between different states in the liberal democratic tradition, as well as a range of caveats and exceptions, we have inherited a tradition of religious liberty which embraces the following precepts: (1) religion should be voluntary, in the negative sense that no-one should be coerced by law to adopt or hold a religion, or to be associated with persons or organizations characterized by specific religious beliefs or practices without their consent; (2) religion should also be voluntary in a positive sense: people should be free to adopt religious commitments and practices subject only to basic neutral limits protecting the interests of others, and such personal religious commitments and practices should where possible be accommodated in public and semi-public settings; (3) no religion is as such contrary to the policy of the law; only specific practices contrary to a non-religious conception of the public interest should be subject to constraint; (4) co-religionists should be free to form religious groups, which should be autonomous in their own sphere, free from state regulation to a significant and even exceptional extent; ( 5) the powers and privileges of religious groups should be available to all religions on terms of equality, that is, according to criteria which are not themselves religious and which have a non-religious rationale; (6) public bodies should be non-religious, in the sense that there should be no religious bar to participation in them or benefit from them, and in the sense that they should not fulfil religious functions or purposes; (7) public and religious bodies should coordinate action and possibly even collaborate in areas of education and social welfare in a way which respects the authenticity of both the religious and the (non-religious) state partner; (8) religious people and places should receive special protection from hostile acts, such as desecration and blasphemy. 5

Growing religious pluralism within individual states also makes an international or globalized approach increasingly attractive in the domestic context. It holds out the promise of an ethical solution rooted in a fundamental commitment to the value of all human beings as equal in dignity and rights. Yet international human rights standards are often considerably lower than those secured in domestic constitutional systems.

First, the scope of conscientious objection and exemptions from general laws (precept (2) above) is protected in international human rights law to a very small extent. 6 Yet within the domestic law of many countries, part of an account of religious freedom includes many more examples of exemptions for the sake of conscience. Furthermore, the religiously informed conscience is sometimes privileged over non-religious moral commitments.7

Second, international human rights law is relatively weak on religious group autonomy (precept (4) above). Over the last decade or so, a substantial body of case-law and practice has grown up around the rights of religious organizations to form, register, hold property, appoint staff, and so on. 8 Yet the European Court has been unwilling to draw clear lines around the powers of self-government. Instead, it prefers to see the state as the neutral and impartial organizer of religious life. 9 Yet within domestic systems, it is easy to find more robust examples of self-government-instances which if absent the relevant religious groups would find it impossible to acquire by way of human rights argumentation.

Third, in the area of education and welfare, many states still operate schemes of collaborative or coordinated provision with religious bodies (precept (7) above). Of course, the liberal political tradition varies considerably in this area. But even the USA and France, which have high degrees of separation between religions and the state, accommodate chaplaincies in public institutions and permit religious schooling. But the human rights principle here is also equality-based, not liberty-based. There is no rightto offer or receive such services.

Finally, there is a lively international debate about the extent to which domestic laws should contain special provision for the protection of religious

believers, or even religions themselves. 10 While the practical enjoyment of liberty may require the state to take positive steps to protect religious believers, such laws can also empower dominant religions to oppress minorities and restrict their freedom in other respects.

The thinness of the conception of :freedom of religion in human rights law is not surprising, given the political need to secure wide consensus and the diversity of levels of protection worldwide. The question is whether the 'levelling down' inherent in human rights law is merely the practical consequence of political and religious diversity, or whether its ethical foundations also have a part to play. To put that question the other way round, is dignity capable of generating a theory of freedom of religion rich enough to explain and justify the constitutional traditions of liberal democracies?

# Framing dignity: instrumentalism and theology

The search for a dignitarian justification of religious liberty takes place against the background of two groups of arguments which fail to satisfy the necessary conditions for such a justification.

One group of familiar arguments for religious liberty is instrumental. These arguments share the view that it is not in our collective interest to restrict religious liberty. First, there is the view which we can call Hobbist, although it is not Hobbes's own. People are apt to find legal constraints on the religion they follow particularly irksome and lacking in legitimacy. This is likely to lead to widespread public dissatisfaction and disorder. Wise governments ,avoid interfering with religion. The problem with this view is that it is contingent on the extent of state power and influence. There may well be cases in which the state can achieve its ends successfully regardless of the impact on religious believers. It is also particularly unhelpful as a constitutional theory, because when judges decide disputed cases of religious liberty they rarely do so under the threat of public disorder, and would be likely to resist strongly any suggestion that such consequences are relevant to their decision-taking. Furthermore, the losers in a regime of religious oppression are likely to be small minorities, which are relatively easy to suppress. The argument is purely pragmatic and largely implausible.

<sup>10</sup> See Sejal Parmar, 'The challenge of "defamation of religions" to freedom of expression and the international human rights', EHRLR 3 (2009), 353-75.

Locke is famously associated with an argument for religious toleration which can be read in two ways.'l On one reading, Locke argues that the state is powerless to influence religious belief and therefore should not try. The empirical assumption of this argument is deeply implausible. Of course, in a very crude sense people do not believe things because the law tells them to. But there are both specific instances in which law can influence belief and a general point to be made in response. For example, banning a minority group (or, more likely, one of its distinctive practices) almost certainly has a delegitimizing effect on its social status and affects its ability to recruit. Teaching in schools according to a state-determined curriculum almost certainly has an effect on what people take to be true. More generally, the view that action always flows from belief is overly intellectual. It is at least as true that practice influences belief, so that if the state can change what people do, it will in due course come to change what they believe as well.

On the other reading, Locke is arguing that if the state cares about orthodoxy it ought also to care about the process by which one comes to believe. What matters is not simply correct belief but correct belief held in the correct way, namely by uncoerced individual commitment. Only a regime of religious liberty can ensure that people come to hold the correct beliefs in the correct way. This argument is also problematic. First, the content of the orthodoxy in question may not include (as Locke it does) a requirement that belief be acquired in a certain way. If all that matters to the state is orthopraxy, there is no reason not to coerce. The argument either inappropriately universalizes Christian or even Protestant assumptions, or is merely *ad hominem* in a context of legally imposed Christian uniformity of public worship. But, second, the problems of religious liberty faced in modem liberal democratic states are not problems of state imposed orthodoxy. Rather, they are more typically problems involving non-religious state policies and regulatory oversight which burden certain religious believers or organizations. Within extreme limits, the modem state is simply not interested in what people believe or how they come to believe it.

Finally, we should note John Stuart Mill's utilitarian argument for religious liberty. A regime of liberty is more conducive to the emergence of truth, in all domains, than a regime of coerced orthodoxy. Moreover, it is not sufficient for liberty to be purely intellectual. People must be free to engage in 'experiments in living' that others may judge of their success. Thus, on the basis of a minimal concern for truth and human well-being, Mill is able to

<sup>11</sup> See John Horton and Susan Mendus (eds), *John Locke, A Letter Concerning Toleration in Focus*  (London, Routledge, 1991).

erect a case for freedom of belief which spans both factual and evaluative claims, as well as freedom of action flowing from belief limited only by some relatively neutral conception of harm.

It should be remembered that Mill is attempting to defend a political theory, not a theory of personal or social morality. He has no problem with those individuals and groups who have committed to an experiment in living. His point is that the instruments of the state and the law should not be brought to bear negatively or positively on them. The true value of their experiment will become more apparent more quickly under a regime of liberty. Nevertheless, it remains the case that Mill's argument seems to mislocate the source of the values it seeks to defend. On his view, freedom ofbeliefis not primarily valuable for the individual believer who is already committed but for the agnostic who is still trying to work out what to believe.

Another quite different set of arguments take as their starting point the ·impossibility of identifying religiously neutral justifications for religious liberty.12 They seek instead to root religious liberty within a political theology. 13 It is no accident that religious liberty as a modern political principle emerged in mid-seventeenth-century Europe. It is the effect of splitting the Christian Church along doctrinal and ecclesiological lines on the basis of individual theological judgement. The Reformation took place in a context in which the Church had always asserted its separate political identity toroyal government but had become subject to the rise of royal absolutism. Out of that explosive and at times violent mixture emerged several connected political beliefs: a specific understanding of the nature of religion based on the existing diversity of Christian belief and practice; a commitment to churches as self-governing institutions; a growing view that states should tolerate (more or less) those who dissented from the majority form of Christianity; a belief in conscience as the decisive factor in individual religious allegiance; new institutions for education, healthcare, and social welfare which were at first religious in ethos

See also Julian Rivers, 'Liberal constitutionalism and Christian political thought', in Paul Beaumont (ed.), *Christian Perspectives on the Limits of the Law* (Carlisle, Paternoster Press, 2002). There is more cautious exploration of the tension between Christian and liberal approaches in Rex Ahdar and Ian Leigh, *Religious Freedom in the Liberal State*  (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005). For a bolder thesis see John Milbank, 'Shari'a and the true basis of group rights: Islam, the West and liberalism', in Rex Ahdar and Nicholas Aroney, *Shari'a in the West* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2010).

Harold Berman's argument from religion as a social precondition for liberty tends in the same direction: 'Religious freedom and the challenge of the modem state', *Emory LawJournal39* (1990), 149.

but institutionally semi-detached from churches. These beliefs eventually bore fruit in a principled attempt to disentangle completely the respective spheres of religion and government. 14

Moreover, this Christian theory of religious liberty can reach back behind a millennium or so of Constantinianism to the first centuries of the Christian Church as a minority disconnected from government power. It can present itself as primitive and-given the normative role of the first generation ofthe Christian Church-authentic. In due time, other religions came to be formed in this image. On this account, even the meaning of the term 'religion' emerges out of a universalized Christianity. More practically, taking on existing forms was the precondition of their enjoying the liberty already available to majority Christian denominations. Theories of religious liberty rely implicitly on this narrative; Locke's own theory is a signal example. 15 More apocalyptic versions of this approach suggest that reasonably widespread and diverse Christian belief and practice is the social precondition for the enjoyment of religious liberty generally, to which secularization poses a considerable threat. 16 Non-establishment can thus only be a surface phenomenon, masking what is an unavoidable ideological foundation to the modem liberal democratic state.

It is highly likely that the constitutional traditions we have inherited depend on a blend of theological and instrumental justifications. Take, for example, the Lockean argument associated with Frederick Schauer and Brian Leiter which focuses not on the *impotence* of the state in producing right belief in the minds of citizens but on its *incompetence* in determining what the content of right belief is. 17 It is admittedly implausible to suppose that political organs are institutionally designed to act as experts on questions of religious truth. Moreover, their suggestion connects to a familiar feature of case-law in which judges decry any ability to determine disputed questions of religious doctrine. This can have the effect of creating legally free spaces for religious belief and practice. In English law it is very difficult to get a defamation action going on the basis of a religious disagreement. 18 However, the same approach can also disempower religious groups, as when acts which would have had a legal effect absent a religious context, such as the formation of a contract

or constitution of a trust, cease to be legally effective. 19 In order to generate familiar features of the law, such as the power of a religious organization to order itself in legally cognizable form under its own organs of government, the court needs to be willing to understand and, all caution and deference notwithstanding, even resolve disputed questions of religious authority doctrine. The incompetence of the court needs to be bounded by a culturally specific sense of the nature and purpose of organized religions. And that is certainly not theologically neutral.

However, both instrumental and theological justifications-and various forms of their combination-are ruled out in a political context in which the law is opened up to considerations of fundamental political principle. The rhetoric of rights carries with it expectations of justification which are noninstrumental and which are rooted in ethical universalism, not religious particularism. These are the dual conditions for a dignitarian justification.

#### **The good of religion**

Theories which fulfil the conditions of non-instrumentalism and ethical universalism can be grouped into two: some seek to show that religion is a universal liberty-grounding good for human beings; others reduce freedom of religion to freedom of conscience or seek to dispense with it altogether.

Martha Nussbaum has recently presented an attractive account which seeks to show that religion is a universal liberty-grounding good.20 She rejects as inadequate a number of suggestions. Religion is not necessarily about a person's relationship to God; it does not necessarily take a group or organized form; religious commitments are not always strongly felt or experienced as obligatory. The idea that religion concerns 'ultimate questions, questions of life and death, the meaning oflife, life's ethical foundation and so forth' gets closer, but this is too dogmatic in a country in which sceptics doubt whether there are answers to such questions. Nussbaum prefers an approach which focuses on the faculty of conscience, but understood more broadly as 'the human capacity to reason, search and experience emotions of longing in respect of the search for ultimate meaning'. It is this faculty, and the space in which it operates, which demands political respect.

This seems to bring Nussbaum very close to John Finnis's account of religion as a rational basic good:

19 *Khaira v Shergill* [2012], EWCA Civ 983.

<sup>20</sup> Martha Nussbaum, *Liberty of Conscience: In Defense of America :S Tradition of Religious Equality*  (New York, Basic Books, 2008), 164-74.

Is it reasonable to deny that it is, at any rate, peculiarly important to have thought reasonably and (where possible) correctly about these questions of the origins of cosmic order and of human freedom and reason-whatever the answer to those questions turns out to be, and even if the answers have to be agnostic or negative?21

Timothy Macklem is critical ofNussbaum's strategy.22 He highlights the dilemma represented on one hand by conventional approaches to the constitutional definition of religion and on the other by psychological approaches which define religion as anything that is of 'ultimate concern' to people. The former approach takes traditional religions as paradigmatic and others as protected to the extent that they resemble them. This type of approach is biased towards historically dominant religions and assumes religious valuemonism, which he rejects as inappropriate for the modem secular state. Value is irreducibly plural. On the other hand, the line of thought starting with William James, which seeks a psychological explanation of the role of religious faith and ends up widening the definition to include any commitment that is of 'ultimate concern' (Paul Tillich) can only be understood as unacceptably subjectivist. Morality must be based on objective value-pluralism. Macklem suggests that Nussbaum makes no progress by straddling this dilemma and landing on a definition of religion which is merely the middle road between tradition and subjective experience.

Macklem's alternative is to locate the value of religion in faith, understood as non-rational belief. He clearly distinguishes faith from trust. 'Both faith and trust ... enable one to believe and to act in the absence of full reason to do so, but tt;ust depends upon the presence of prior, albeit incomplete reasons, while faith does not depend upon reason at all. ' 23 One might think that it is only trust that is valuable, enabling us to deal with ignorance on the basis only of partial reasons. But Macklem asserts that faith can be valuable for some people too. Reasons are not always present to everyone; faith is valuable if it serves a person's well-being in those dimensions of his or her life in which reasons are not available. Two examples he gives are of people who have faith in the resurrection of Jesus, which enables them to cope well with the mystery of death, and theists who think morality can only derive from the command of God. 24 Macklem himself does not think that death is mysterious and thinks that morality can be derived from rational reflection on what contributes to human well-being. But for people who do not agree, faith is valuable.

<sup>22</sup> Macklem, *Independence of Mind.* 

<sup>23</sup> Macklem, *Independence of Mind,* 136-7.

<sup>24</sup> Macklem, *Independence of Mind,* 145.

On this basis, Macklem defends a theory of freedom of religion. Freedom of religion is freedom for 'collective participation in institutions and practices that manifest a freely given personal commitment to a particular set of beliefs, commitment to which is capable of enhancing human well-being; beliefs that are not based on reason alone but are held at least in part on the basis of faith'. 25 By contrast, non-establishment follows not from its contribution to freedom of religion but from the partial nature of religious-based morals and the need to secure a secular foundation for public life. One further consequence, which Macklem does not note, is that freedom of conscience and freedom of religion become diametrically opposed. Like trust, conscience is part of our engagement with and practical response to reasons.

Macklem's approach seeks to defend the value of religion by reference to the functional role faith can have in a person's life. Andrew Koppelman generalizes and radicalizes such an approach, thus rejecting all essentialising views of what religion is good for. For him,

> Religion denotes a cluster of goods, including salvation if you think you need to be saved; harmony with the transcendent origin of universal order, if it exists; responding to the fundamentally imperfect character of human life, if it is imperfect; courage in the face of the heartbreaking aspects of human existence, if that kind of encouragement helps; a transcendent underpinning for the resolution to act morally, if that kind of underpinning helps; contact with the awesome and indescribable, if awe is something you feel; and many others. No general description of the good that religion seeks to promote can be satisfactory, politically or intellectually. 26

This cluster of goods both serves to make religions special and to warrant their constitutional position. He thinks it is sufficient to move one beyond mere tolerance to a position of 'appraisal respect' for a person whose religious beliefs. are different from one's own.

It is questionable whether either Macklem's or Koppelman's accounts of the good of religion can generate sufficient force behind a claim to a religious right. A person's non-rational belief may ground a weak prima facie duty not to interfere with actions derived from that belief, but the moment there is any reason to restrict action, the non-rational nature of the belief makes it impossible to weigh or evaluate. Or perhaps one falls back on purely subjective evaluations of how strongly a person feels about their belief. No solution to the clash of rights can carry any inter-subjective plausibility. Koppelman's pluralistic account suffers from the additional weaknesJ> that it is no longer

clear that we are considering a single distinctive phenomenon of 'religion'. If the good of religion becomes excessively broad and plural, its value evaporates altogether.

# Liberty without religion

Some theorists, perhaps motivated by the need to reflect the seriousness of a religious claim, seek to understand freedom of religion instead as a special case of freedom of conscience. Human rights texts put the two very close together, and John Rawls certainly seems to conflate them.27 Michael Sandel also argues that freedom of conscience is the best candidate for an underlying theory of freedom of religion.28 Arguments that (political and legal) freedom is good for religion lack a universal basis-it all depends on the religion in question-while arguments that neutrality or separation are good for the state depend on contentious empirical foundations. Focusing on autonomy in the sense of freedom of choice reflects a false view of the person as an unencumbered chooser of what to believe and how to live. Religion is not worthy of respect simply because it is chosen. Rather, freedom of conscience connects to the individual's grasp of truth and obligation. 'Where freedom of conscience is at stake, the relevant right is to exercise a duty, not make a choice. ' 29

Arguments from freedom of conscience are attractive, since there is general agreement that conscience might, but need not, be informed by a broader religious world view. The fact that an individual conceives of her moral commitment as an experience of the voice or requirement of God shows that it does indeed bear down on her with obligatory force. And the location of the substance of the moral commitment at stake in a broader account of the nature and place of human beings in the world warrants its plausibility as a genuinely moral commitment as opposed to mere idiosyncratic whim. But both of these requirements-a sense of obligatory force and a wider account of reality which makes the obligation identity-constituting---can be present and respected in non-religious ways of thinking. The state is therefore protected from distinguishing between religion and non-religion. At the same time, respect for the individual's conscience requires freedom of belief and action.

To such approaches, Koppelman makes two powerful responses.30 The first probes the grounding of conscience's force. Koppelman suggests that once any external referent is removed from the idea of conscience, all that one is left with is volitional necessity. The idea here is that we respect the conscientious act because the actor felt compelled to take the stand he did. But volitional necessity is massively over-inclusive. The homicidal maniac also experiences volitical necessity. There must be some connection to objective value, some external referent by which to judge the validity of the experience of necessity. He finds the most plausible suggestion here to lie in Amy Gutmann's idea of the 'will to be moral'. 'The distinctively human effort to conceive and live an ethical life' is itself valuable, even when misdirected.31 But this cannot be an absolute claim, and the limits to toleration can only be set by reference to what is *actually* an ethical life.

Koppelman's second response is to question how far freedom of conscience takes us. It can only explain a small part of freedom of religion jurisprudence. The category of conscience works well for acts which have a clear moral significance-acts, for example, involving the life or well-being of another human person. But religions cannot be reduced to acts of clear moral significance. Many core aspects of religious practice are engaged in habitually; others are better seen as matters of ritual; still others, such as the appointment of ministers, are essentially administrative and organizational. It seems odd to characterize all religious life in such highly moralized terms.

For many theorists, freedom of conscience is a given, and the really live question is whether there is any grounding for freedom of religion over and above that given. 32

Ronald Dworkin is perhaps the most well known of those who think not.33 Dworkin understands dignity to embrace two sub-principles: self-respect and authenticity. These lead us to accept a right to ethical independence, by which he means an anti-utilitarian political claim to judge for ourselves what makes our life go well, and to live accordingly. Ethics is sharply distinguished from morality, which concerns what we owe to each other.34 This sets limits to our right to ethical independence. Religious freedom is just one aspect of the right

to ethical independence, religion being no different from other foundational ethical choices.35 This suggests that a specific right to religious freedom is not necessary--or perhaps only pragmatically necessary if religious dimensions of ethical independence are particularly vulnerable. The work can be done by more general rights to privacy and to freedom of belief, expression, and association. Furthermore, the state has no right to impose on dissenters its dominant conception of a life lived well. The non-establishment principle is not merely institutional but also ideological.

Other recent and creative attempts to justify freedom of religion seem to be caught between the implicit adoption of some more or less inadequate account of the good of religion and the conclusion that religion has no special place within liberal political theory. For example, Christopher Eisgruber and Lawrence Sager are well known for their defence of an equality-based argument in which religious exemptions from general laws seek to redress the structural biases of surrounding cultural assumptions. 36 Yet in order to defend religious group autonomy, they argue that privacy arguments apply to religious groups to an extent that they do not apply to commercial or political contexts. Religion is distinctive in being both personal and organized. They claim that religious arguments for conscientious action are different from secular ones in that the state is unable to assess their validity. They are, therefore immune, from being discounted in quite the same way. Finally, their conception of non-discrimination requires reasonable accommodation, which presupposes a certain degree of sympathy for the burden the general law imposes on the individual believer. Indeed, they draw an analogy with disability discrimination and refer to religious commitments as a type of 'moral disability'. This is not meant in a pejorative sense, but simply to highlight the appropriateness of reallocating the burdens of religious practice by creating exemptions.

All these features of their argument suggest that in spite of their intentions, Eisgruber and Sager have not wholly escaped the assumption that religion occupies a special place in people's lives, which the political community must respect. Adopting an equality-based approach which consistently refuses to see religion as special produces exactly the reduction in religious liberty referred to at the start of the chapter. As Brian Barry shows forcefully, non-discrimination norms make it wrong to impose religious barriers to political or economic life; but they also make it wrong to take account of religion in conferring benefits.37 When it comes to framing a law requiring the

# Conclusion: the problem with dignity

In the face of such diversity, Kent Greenawalt meets the challenge of justifying religious liberty in a way which has been termed 'eclectic reasonableness' .38 In his view, there is no core justification for freedom of religion. It matters for a variety of reasons, and that variation should not cause us concern, because the fact that it matters is sufficiently secure.

Eclectic reasonableness is undoubtedly a desirable characteristic oflegislatures which have the luxury of agreeing on statutory solutions to political problems without needing to agree on their underlying reasons. For a court seeking to ground its judgments in abstract statements of political principle such a consensual solution is hardly satisfactory. Moreover, Greenawalt himself acknowledges that his eclectic reasonableness is vulnerable to external scepticism. He admits that it is entirely possible that his moderately 'progressive' conclusions on the meaning of the first amendment (i.e., a fairly strong reading of both the free exercise and non-establishment clauses) are derived from his weak Protestant Christian commitments.39 But we should be more concerned by the internal scepticism which also follows. For example, in responding to criticisms that he is insufficiently committed to a jurisdictional approach to questions of Church autonomy, Greenawalt confesses himself 'moderately supportive' and willing to revise his, position. Such flexibility is illuminating: reasonable people find it difficult to decide hard cases and are willing to reconsider their views. In the face of the levelling-down pressure from international human rights discourse noted at the start of this chapter, something more robust is needed.

The two main points of weakness in the emerging theory and practice of religious liberty concern the *weight* of religious claims and the *selfgovernment* of religious individuals and groups.40 As regards the question of weight, constitutional systems are increasingly recognizing the fact that judges are required to balance competing interests, both individual and collective, in order to resolve difficult cases. While the structure of the processes

of reasoning involved is becoming increasingly clear, substantive decisions rest on some sense of the relative importance of the interests concerned. The first challenge is to reverse a creeping trivialization of religious claims.

The second area of weakness concerns self-government. Along with the rest of civil society, organized religions are becoming submerged in a web of govemmentality which undermines their capacity to act as counterweights to the state. The regulatory state is displacing the traditional public/private divide. We need also to recapture a sense of individual self-government which is broader than the traditional claims of conscience: the wearing of personal religious symbols provides a case in point. Freedom of religion needs to be understood not merely as a negative liberty, that is, as an absence of law to permit a sphere of religious endeavour (however defined), but also as a positive liberty, that is, as including the capacity of individuals to participate in shaping an individual and collective life *under law* which contrasts with the collective life mediated by the state.

The dignitarian justifications on offer so far seem unable to meet this challenge. And perhaps the problem lies with dignity itself-or at any rate the dominant conception ofit.41 For from Pico della Mirandola's famous oration onwards, dignity locates the source of value in the self-creating human person.42 This autonomy has always carried within itself the seeds of a fundamental antagonism to religion.43 In a postmodern context which idolizes self-constructed identities, religions can only be valuable as personal ideologies or world views. They have their value as the projections of individuals, not as (inevitably partial and flawed) responses to what is already externally given. It is hardly to be expected that this can ground the weight of religious claims, both to individual and collective self-government, which we have inherited. Indeed, it is not surprising that its role in human rights discourse so far has been rather to *limit* the right to freedom of religion.44 If dignity is to do any serious justificatory work here, it will need to be conceived of quite differently.
