# **Dignified Disciplinarity: Towards a Transdisciplinary Understanding of Human Dignity**

*Alexandra Kemmerer1* 

'lNTERDISCIPLINARITY' SHOULD NOT BE treated as a shibboleth or a sign of one's advanced thinking. Neither is it an incantation that will magically solve our problems. Interdisciplinarity is simply a means. But to what end? Pragmatically put, towards the ends of greater insight and greater success at problem solving. More fundamentally, however, interdisciplinarity is a means towards the end of preserving or achieving the good life in a complex, global, rapidly innovating society. That is, interdisciplinarity constitutes an implicit philosophy of knowledge-not an epistemology but rather a general reflection on whether and to what degree knowledge can help us achieve the perennial goal ofliving the good life. It is the newest expression of a very old question.2

#### Introduction

The conference from which this book evolved was in its subtitle characterized as 'an Interdisciplinary Conference' .3 Interdisciplinarity has now (finally) also in the legal field become a buzzword, attracting funders and scholars alike.

<sup>1</sup> This chapter is based on conference comments that have been revisited and rethought during a research visit at the University of Michigan Law School and the Bentley Historical Library of the University of Michigan. I am grateful to the Rechtskulturen Fellows 2012-13 at Humboldt University Law School in Berlin and to Lucy Chebout for a living experience of reflexive disciplinarity. Two conferences on 'The Concept of Human Dignity', convened at the Wissenschaftskolleg in Berlin, provided important inspiration.

Yet, conceptually and methodologically the term remains often obscure and ambiguous-not unlike the concept of dignity itself. That obscurity prompts a more profound inquiry into the disciplinary approaches and engagements with the term and concept of human dignity that we find assembled here. While most contributions are confined to the analytical and theoretical framework of a single discipline or a particular field or subdiscipline, the shared communicative space of the book (and of the preceding conference) allows for comparisons and confrontations reaching beyond the respective disciplinary boundaries. Hence, how do these different and diverse approaches relate? How do they, when placed side by side, inform a more pluralistic and nuanced understanding of dignity as a concept? What makes all the difference, and justifies the costs and labours of bringing together scholars from diverse backgrounds?

For full disclosure, my interest in such questions is prompted by my experience in the development of a research network and postdoctoral fellow programme that aims to enhance, from a genuinely legal perspective, a recontextualization of law within the field of the humanities, the cultural and social sciences.4 The programme, entitled REcHT IM KoNTEXT, brings together scholars of law from a variety of disciplinary and regional backgrounds.

Conceptually, it is intended to bring together and integrate various disciplinary, systematic, and regional approaches, to create a space of reflection and communication. Fundamental questions of law, the public/private divide, the pluriverse of courts and the dilemmata of legal pluralism, for example, shall be renegotiated and reconnected with doctrine and methodology.

For reasons that will be further explained in the following, the term and concept of human dignity not only prompts reflection from a variety of disciplinary perspectives-it requires such a plurality of approaches in order to be adequately understood and examined. And it makes an excellent substantive issue for an exercise in scholarship reaching beyond the borders of established disciplines, fields, and subdisciplines.

This chapter focuses chiefly on the possibilities (and problems) of such research beyond disciplinary boundaries. After outlining a taxonomy that aims to clarify the sometimes obscure concepts of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity in part two, part three highlights some of the learning experiences that the Oxford exercise provided, and argues that it contributes to an experience of disciplined disciplinarity or reflexive disciplinarity. Part four develops the concept of such reflexive, disciplined and hence dignified disciplinarity further, and outlines a methodological response to the challenges of

new research questions and necessary innovations, but also to the pluralism behind these challenges.

# Beyond disciplinarity

As already mentioned, our dignitarian exercise was initially labelled as interdisciplinary. Yet, were we truly interdisciplinary when we met for two days at Oxford's Rhodes House in June 2012? An answer to that question requires, in the first place, some terminological clarification. What are we talking about when we talk about disciplinarity, and about trans-, multi-, and interdisciplinarity? And intradisciplinarity? And should we not simply respect disciplinary boundaries and our limited abilities to apply a variety of methodologies?5 Maybe some epistemic humility would be appropriate, anyway, amid all these buzzwords.

At the outset, let us talk about disciplinarity. The story does not need to be retold here in detail. 6 In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the increasing activities of ordering and collecting all available knowledge, the delineating and systematic arranging of topics, and the ever more intense interaction between participants in scientific communities resulted in a dramatic growth of science that finally led to a differentiation of knowledge into disciplines. While throughout the eighteenth century, books, articles, and even experiments were still addressed to the general public, the more specialized the communication among scholars became, the more it was addressed to themselves. This closure of communicative communities, expressed through specialized journals and in the organization of scholarly associations, turned communication inward, and led to a self-referentiality of disciplinary communities: 'The disciplinary community became the relevant public.' 7

But as knowledge became abundant, the quest for interdisciplinarity represented the resurgence of interest in a larger view of things. 8 The expansion of knowledge production since the Second World War led to demands for more accountability-and was, in itself, often a site of new forms of interdisciplinary 'knowledge production', as in the field of area studies heavily

subsidized and thereby triggered by Cold War philanthrophic actors such as the Ford Foundation, with a so far largely unexplored impact on the shape and disciplinary development of post-war international law and the new field of the law of European integration.9

The number of interdisciplinary activities saw an enormous growth over the latter half of the twentieth century. And, as Julie Thompson Klein puts it in her excellent taxonomic chapter in the recently published *Oxford Handbook of Interdisciplinarity,* they gave rise 'to new taxonomies that registered the genus "Interdisciplinarity", propelled by new species of integration, collaboration, complexity, critique and problem solving' .10

Now, how are we to classify these new species? How do we identify and distinguish multidisciplinarity, interdisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, and the various variations of these core classifications?

It speaks for itself that the first major interdiscipljnary typology was published in 1972, created for an international conference held in France in 1970 and co-sponsored by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). 11 Here, also, the notion of transdisciplinarity comes into play. Transdisciplinarity was defined as a common system of axioms that transcend the narrow scope of disciplinary world views through an overarching synthesis, such as anthropology construed as the science of humans. 12 It describes a broad field of a synoptic discipline, a team-based holistic approach to health care or climate change, or, more recently-and maybe we will hear more on this shortly-to the regulation of financial markets. 13

In Julie Thomson Klein's taxonomy, transdisciplinarity is characterized as 'transcending, transgressing, transforming', while multidisciplinarity is 'juxtaposing, sequencing, coordinating'. Interdisciplinarity, however, comes

with many faces: it is 'integrating, interacting, linking, focusing, blending', and it may either be complementing or hybridizing. 14

Multidisciplinarity, from the OECD's definition on, has always been seen as an approach that juxtaposes disciplines. 'Juxtaposition fosters wider knowledge, information and methods. Yet disciplines remain separate, disciplinary elements retain their original identity, and the existing structure of knowledge is not questioned.' 15 It is evident that many so-called interdisciplinary conferences, courses, and curricula are actually multidisciplinary assemblages of presentations, classes, and courses with a clear-cut disciplinary identity-but there is no question that there is a clear distinction to be made between multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary approaches.

Things are more difficult when it comes to a clear definition of transdisciplinarity versus interdisciplinarity. Given the broad concept of interdisciplinarity and its many faces (as described by Julie Thompson Klein), I follow here Jiirgen MittelstraB's definition of interdisciplinarity. 16 For MittelstraB, interdisciplinarity and transdisciplinarity are not alternative concepts. Transdisciplinarity, as he uses it, can merely be seen as a 'sharper version' of interdisciplinarityY MittelstraB writes: 'Interdisciplinarity, if understood correctly, does not wander between subjects or disciplines, or hovers (as does the absolute spirit) above subjects and disciplines. [Interdisciplinarity] merely transcends substantial and disciplinary narrowings where they are obstacles to problem analysis and research development; it is, in truth, transdisciplinarity.' 18

MittelstraB, in his definition of transdisciplinarity as the 'better interdisciplinarity', rightly highlights the transcendental character oftransdisciplinarity. Disciplines and disciplinary boundaries are not ignored and left behind but merely transcended. Their identity and methodology is respected, but opened up to an outside perspective that allows at the same time for internal

Sie hebt vielmehr fachliche und diszipliniire Engfiihrungen, wo diese der Problementwicklung und einem entsprechenden Forschungshandeln im Wege stehen, wieder auf; sie ist in Wahrheit Transdisziplinaritiit.'

reflexivity. Transdisciplinarity, in such an understanding, could also be defined as permeability. 19 As a form of bridge-building, it allows for a redefinition of disciplinary fields from their disciplinary inside and for a reflexive use of disciplinary traditions, without an entire restructuring and a weakening of disciplinary boundaries.

It is a tool to redefine disciplinary fields. It is transcendent but not transgressive.20 Beyond the traditional, linear mode of knowledge production emerges a new, second mode ofheterarchical organic knowledge production.

Helga Nowotny, the President of the European Research Council, a sociologist and lawyer by training, has described that new mode of knowledge production with the metaphor of the rhizome-not unfamiliar to legal networkers drawing from Deleuze and Guatteri.2' The rhizome, as Nowotny stresses, highlights the structures of closely connected networks of knowledge that transport questions, challenges, and solutions in all directions.22

Given its transcendent, yet not transgressing, character, I do think that our collective undertaking here has been a truly transdisciplinary endeavour. In the following, I will explain why, and point to present shortcomings and future challenges.

# Dignity as a placeholder and a reflexive tool

I think the participants of the Oxford conference set out on a process of transcending and transforming, while not attempting to integrate and blend their disciplinary backgrounds, experiences, and methodologies. I learned, however, thavthe juxtaposition of contributions from a variety of disciplines·did not and does not automatically lead to a transformation of the respective positions and to a more reflexive take on speakers' own At times, there were decidedly hermetic papers, without an outside, not opening up to any interaction with the transdisciplinary world beyond their own disciplinary background, and hence indeed impermeable. But the broad majority of contributions presented at Oxford and now assembled here did open up, al-

lowing for connections and interrelations that led to respective illuminations and enrichments.

I learned that case studies are not only what lawyers would regard as such but also conceptual studies, or just reflections on fundamentals again-and that sometimes the distinction between case studies and fundamental theories is not as clear-cut as one might think at first.

I learned that dignity has many faces. The concept may seem empty and vague,23 or overloaded with normative gravity,24 but it is also a *Sehnsuchtswort,25*  an expression of longing for a distant truth. It is a placeholder, opening a discursive space to negotiate our various and diverse understandings of fundamental values and normative groundings, as Christopher McCrudden has emphasized in his seminal 2008 EJIL article.26 Conor Gearty points to that placeholder function in his reference to 'dignitarian pluralism', allowing to voice and transcend our various time-bound conceptions of human dignity.27

But throughout discussions and papers, the concept of dignity turned also out to be a tool to establish and improve reflexive disciplinarity, a more profound understanding of disciplinary boundaries and of the respective methodological and epistemic frames in which we are thinking and writing.

In particular, the historical studies presented by Samuel Moyn,28 Rebecca Scott,29 and Christoph Goos30 unveil the potentialities of dignity as a tool to enhance disciplinary reflexivity and to overcome disciplinary boundaries. Moyn's historical examination ofthe influence of Catholic social thought on the concept of dignity as enshrined in post-war human rights codices easily connected with theological and philosophical reflections presented by David Hollenbach31 and Clemens Sedmak,32 but also with Christoph Goos's historical account of the origins of dignity in the (pre-)history of the German Basic Law. Goos's chapter, in tum, resonated with the presentations from other public lawyers highlighting, from different angles, the German dignitarian 'Sonderweg' (Dieter Grimm, Christoph Mollers, Reva Siegel). Rebecca Scott's historical research on human dignity in anti-slavery discourses opened

Fruitful transdisciplinarity does not require explicitly comparative approaches in order to reach beyond mere juxtapositions. Whenever the specificities of an individual approach are made explicit and the limits of particular disciplinary approaches are respected, this leads in itself to a more profound understanding of that perspective-from inside but also from outside. It does not change our disciplinary identities-but it helps us to transcend them.

# Reflexive disciplinarity as dignified disciplinarity

Transcending disciplinary boundaries is a challenge and a temptation,33 and it requires, as Samantha Besson and Alain Zysset have demonstrated for the field of Human Rights History and Human Rights Theory, engaging with Hans Joas's recent study on the genealogy of human rights,34 'mutual taming and learning' .35 Yet it allows us in the first place to tame our own disciplinary passions and biases, and to learn about our own limitations. A reflexive disciplinarity is a disciplined disciplinarity,36 and allows for a contextualization of our understanding of human dignity.

We can learn here from the centuries-old experiences of disciplines with strong intradisciplinary traditions,37 such as theology and law. Here, we find a treasure of experiences with intradisciplinary interactions and connections. Often, they are only dealt with rather intuitively, taken for granted. And certainly the interrelations of subdisciplinary fields require (and merit) more attention and effort than is dedicated to them at present. Intradisciplinarity, as

transdisciplinarity, needs to be cultivated and nourished. It is a precondition for any fruitful transdisciplinary endeavour.

The conference has shown-and so do the contributions-that we will not agree on a common concept of human dignity. And why should we?

Sam Moyn has voiced the assumption that the great times of dignity may be over. In Germany, as in other places, we experience a certain dignity fatigue. And yet the term prompts discourse and interaction, and allows for spaces and habits to cultivate pluralism: substantive pluralism, when it comes to diverse values and choices. And disciplinary pluralism. Both concepts are closely interconnected.

If we are 'to ensure that dignity does not tum into a black box to hide prejudice or to allow cultural stereotyping', 38 we may indeed dive into intellectual history, but also open up to other transdisciplinary transgressions and irritations.

For any inquiry into the concept of human dignity, what Peer Zumbansen has recently written about the concept of governance is true-a concept no less vague and contested than human dignity:

> The significance of the term lies in its horizontal and vertical irritation of disciplinary discourse as it forces us, on the one hand, to think about the connections between 'different' analytical and conceptual frameworks and, on the other, to take seriously the exhaustion of individual disciplines' vocabulary and established patterns of construction.39

What is true for governance is also true for human dignity: 'The key to understanding( ... ) then lies in accepting its interdisciplinary and transformative natures. ' 40

Reflexive disciplinarity opens not only spaces of translation and innovation,41 it also allows for contestation42 and confrontation,43 and for a renegotiation of conceptual frames.

We may quarrel about the proper habitat of the concept of dignity, and about the necessity of a particular starting point for our analysis. 44 Why should we not, as Michael Rosen suggests, move back and forth between the legal context and the moral analysis?45

While I have reservations about Jeremy Waldron's claim 'that dignity is more at home in the law (including the philosophical and normative part of jurisprudence) than in morality considered apart from the law',46 I am intrigued by his insistence on the necessity of a particular starting point. It is our reflexive disciplinary situatedness that allows for a more nuanced understanding of a rich and diverse concept such as dignity.

Human dignity as a concept does not-and should not-break down boundaries between otherwise distinct discourses, disciplines, and theories of normative orders. But it should be used to call our established. reference frameworks into question and to encourage reflexive disciplinarity. If we cultivate reflexivity, any reference to the concept of human dignity prompts the inclusion of competing disciplinary interpretations, allowing us to cope in a more dignified manner with the challenges of pluralism and of competing values and traditions.
