A second set of rights concern work: everyone has a right to work, to join a labour union, to a free choice of occupation, a just wage, equal pay for equal work, decent conditions of work (Article 23), and to limited working hours and paid holidays (Article 24). A third set of economic rights protect the vulnerable from specific injustices: everyone has a right against slavery and servitude (Article 4) and against discrimination on the basis of their race, gender, or other social identities (Articles 2 and 23). These economic rights are supposed to be specially connected to the dignity of human beings. What conception of dignity is capable of supporting the UDHR's list of economic rights?},

It is because human persons have dignity that they have human rights. The Preamble to the UDHR further states that human rights are `inalienable rights of all members of the human family', possessed equally by all members of this family, all of whom have `inherent dignity'.Alan Gewirth argues that agents (those with the capacity and disposition to pursue purposes voluntarily) must, on pain of contradicting that they are agents, accept and comply with the `Principle of Generic Consistency' (PGC), which requires them to respect the `generic rights' of all agents (Gewirth 1978: 53–8). Consequently, the PGC is a principle with which all rational action must comply. In Gewirth's terminology, the PGC is `dialectically necessary', which is to say that the requirement for an agent to assent to it follows purely logically from a premise that no agent can coherently deny, namely, the claim of the agent that he, she or it is an agent.},

I will discuss each of these in turn, and suggest that human dignity in Hinduism is an ambiguous and perhaps even paradoxical concept: on the one hand, all living beings (not solely human beings) are thought to possess inherent dignity, but on the other hand we find that in the social realm dignity appears in degrees.The UpanisadsThe Upanisads are dialogues in Sanskrit which were handed down orally as part of the Veda, articulating the essentials of Vedic wisdom. These dialogues, stemming from approximately the sixth century BC, contain two central doctrines: the teachings of atman and brahman – explaining the identity of Self and UniversalWhole – and the doctrine of reincarnation or metempsychosis.},

In both the northern and the southern hemispheres, in common law and civilian legal systems, we find that human dignity plays a prominent role. It is also a cornerstone concept of many regional and international conventions and declarations. However, the jurisprudence of human dignity betrays a familiar tension. Whereas, in some cases, human dignity is articulated and applied in a `liberal' spirit (underpinned by an `empowerment' conception), in others the guiding spirit is `conservative' (underpinned by a conception of `human dignity as constraint') (Beyleveld and Brownsword 2001). Broadly speaking, while liberals appeal to human dignity in order to protect and to extend the sphere of individual choice, conservatives appeal to human dignity in order to impose limits on what they see as the legitimate sphere of individual choice.Introducing the legal section of the handbook, three general issues are addressed. First, there is the question of how we should view the burgeoning references to human dignity (often in conjunction with human rights) in international and regional instruments. Second, there is the question of how we should understand the role of human dignity in national legal systems. Finally, there is the question of whether positive law is enhanced by references to human dignity or whether it would be an improvement to eliminate all such legal allusions.},

	abstract = {If we consider that the concept of human dignity appeared only quite recently (after the Second World War) as a legal reference, we may have doubts regarding its utility. Why should we consider useful a concept which was legally non-existent since Roman legal reasoning? But we may interpret the question posed in the title of this chapter to raise another issue: what is the meaning of utility in a legal perspective? All lawyers – whether in the tradition of common law or civil law – know that the law uses concepts to create legal categories and to qualify facts and situations in order to incorporate them in the social theatre in which we all live. In that sense, the rationality of the law tends to have useful social meanings and does not need purely theoretical or metaphysical concepts because they cannot serve its main purpose: to maintain the organization of the society on the basis of legal norms. I understand that the vagueness and uncertainty of the concept of human dignity may create some trouble and disinterest in using it as a legal reference, especially for those who conceive of law as a practical exercise which aims at finding the appropriate answers to precise questions (discussed in the first section below). However, as a pragmatic lawyer, I have also to consider that the concept of human dignity is already present in international law as well as in different domestic legislation. Its appearance during the second part of the twentieth century should not be neglected in understanding the message sent by its introduction in law (discussed in the second section below).},

	abstract = {One of the major philosophical justifications for laws making sexual services (or the use of these) illegal is that prostitution is, intrinsically, a violation of human dignity, especially of the human dignity of women. Paying a person in order to accomplish a sexual act upon her or to have her accomplish a sexual act upon oneself is, so the argument runs, using her as a mere tool for sexual gratification, and this is so even if we suppose – what some claim to be impossible – that the person in question offers her sexual services voluntarily and without being forced or coerced. Consent may be transformative in many instances, but it cannot transform a prostitutional act into something compatible with human dignity, however well the client may treat the prostitute. Behind the humane treatment in the context of particular acts, one should always see the inhumane institution. In this sense, prostitution could be said to resemble slavery.There is no denying the fact that prostitution as it exists nowadays is to a very large extent incompatible with respect for human dignity. Even before looking at the client who uses the prostitute for his sexual gratification, we must take account of all those people who use the prostitute as a source of revenue, keeping her under inhumane conditions, using violence against her whenever it pleases them, leaving her a very insubstantial part of what she receives from the clients, etc. Abducting a person, by force or by deceit, and then forcing her to prostitute herself is clearly contrary to human dignity and is rightly criminalized. And it can also be argued that clients who may be supposed to know that the prostitute is exploited can be criminalized.},

	abstract = {The meaning of human dignityThis chapter is concerned with how the concept of human dignity relates to the current debates in biomedical ethics about the commodification of the human body and its parts. Before considering the specific topics dealt with in this discussion, I shall clarify how I am using the term `human dignity'. In accordance with the approach of this volume as a whole, my use depends on the way in which the concept functions in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) of 1948. It appears in the very first sentence of the Preamble to the Declaration: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world…As this wording makes clear, dignity is closely aligned to human rights, but also to the human family – not merely to the rights of individual members. This emphasis on human solidarity will be very important for my exposition of the issues in the current move towards the commodification of human bodily materials through what has been called the `tissue economy' (Waldby and Mitchell 2006). In the decades since the UDHR was adopted, biomedical ethics developed dramatically in the United States and other Western nations; however, the debate rapidly seemed to place the sole focus on a notion of autonomy, narrowly understood as the individual's capacity of free choice. Such a narrow focus cannot be justified if we look at the detailed requirements of the UDHR, based on the core concepts of inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights. Just a few of the specific requirements of the UDHR illustrate this: Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.Article 25: Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services, and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond his control.Article 29: Everyone has duties to the community in which alone the free and full development of his personality is possible.},

In the philosophical context, the main use of the approach is to assess the justice of social arrangements: societies are just to the extent that they guarantee each citizen an entitlement to his or her basic capabilities. In more recent years, Nussbaum has emphasized the fact that the capability approach is a human rights approach, and has begun to ground her version of the approach in a specific concept of human dignity. In this chapter, I will first briefly summarize the main concepts used in the capability approach, and then present Nussbaum's concept of dignity as a grounding of that approach. Finally, I will criticize this way of using the concept of dignity and raise some questions.The capability approachThe capability approach is used by social scientists, lawyers and philosophers, in a variety of contexts, for descriptive, evaluative and prescriptive purposes. What all these uses share is only a rather minimal conceptual apparatus: namely, a stress on `capabilities to functionings' as the favoured focus for research.},

	abstract = {The aim of this chapter is to inquire how the principle of human dignity applies to the political question of the treatment of immigrants and refugees. Human dignity is often given two related meanings: first, the intrinsic and equal value of each human being; and, second, a dignified human life, i.e. a life lived under decent conditions. Decent conditions imply for example freedom and education, as well as the absence of repression, torture and starvation. Both meanings are related to human rights; owing to her intrinsic value each human being has rights to freedom, health etc. Human dignity in the second sense informs us about the requirements for a decent human life, i.e. the content of human rights (Collste 2002).Refugees and immigrants are in a vulnerable position. They are forced to leave their homes and are potential victims of exploitation and extortion. This chapter deals primarily with the political and ethical conditions for respecting the human dignity of immigrants and refugees. How can a `global political practice' (Heuser 2008: 71) of respecting their dignity be justified from a moral point of view? There is a link between arguments for human dignity, human rights and moral cosmopolitanism. According to moral cosmopolitanism, the individual human being is the ultimate unit of worth and entitled to equal consideration regardless of such contingencies as nationality and citizenship (Beitz 1999; Tan 2004).},

Nowhere has this been made more apparent than in the Preamble to the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights, where dignity is understood as the foundation of `freedom, justice and peace in the world'. The validity and legitimacy of universal human rights has consequently shifted and now rest in the supposed dignity of all persons. Yet, if dignity is the ground or basis for human rights, what is the ground or basis of dignity?In his magnum opus, Formalism in Ethics and Non-Formal Ethics of Values, Max Scheler takes the question concerning the ground of human dignity as a primary motivation. As suggested by the subtitle of the work, A New Attempt Toward the Foundation of an Ethical Personalism, Scheler's task is to provide a new grounding, a phenomenological rather than rationalistic grounding, for the human being as a person and, consequently, a new grounding for the dignity of the person. For Scheler, any purely formal or rationalistic account of dignity leads to the depersonalization of the human being. The ground of dignity, rather, is the absolute value of the individual person given in the act of love, an act that reveals the other as a wholly unique and irreplaceable person.},

	abstract = {Two genealogies of human rightsHuman rights reflect a determined effort to protect the dignity of each and every human being against abuse of power through fundamental rights. Notably, in the global political idea of human rights that emerged after the Second World War, two genealogies converged: first, the fight for universal recognition and equal protection of the dignity of each and every human being; and, second, the struggle for inalienable fundamental rights as a way to protect citizens against abuse of power, in particular by their own sovereign (the state).Strikingly, while the emergence of the basic rights idea as legal protection against abuse of power, particularly by one's own sovereign, may indeed be called a `Western' history, the narrative of universal recognition and protection of human dignity could just as well be termed `anti-Western' history in the sense that equal dignity had to be vindicated in contravention of Western ideas and powers. For instance, the idea of legal principles was already part of Roman law (generalia iuris principia). One of these referred to freedom as something of inestimable value (libertas inaestimabilis res est); yet the application of this principle excluded subjugated peoples in general and slaves in particular. In fact, the whole story of the realization of universal human dignity must be understood as an ongoing political struggle. Indeed, the struggles against colonization and conquest, and the historical efforts to fight racial and ethnic hierarchy, have shaped the idea of truly universal human rights (Gilroy 2009).},

In Germany, it found its first written embodiment in the legal system in Article 1, paragraph 1, of the German Federal Constitution (Grundgesetz) of May 1949, which corresponded to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of December 1948. From that point began the triumphant development of human dignity, finding also expression in Article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Today, human dignity constitutes a central point of reference in practically every moral and legal discourse around the world.In this chapter, I will examine, first, the exceptional position of human dignity in the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of Germany. The subsequent sections analyze the difficulties in interpreting this fundamental notion of law. The next section demonstrates how human dignity influences in different ways the current (statutory) law (private law, criminal law, public law). This will demonstrate that the absoluteness and imponderable nature of human dignity can only be preserved if its application is limited to a small but absolutely undisputed and generally accepted number of factual situations. The assumed triumphant development of human dignity, however, produces the result that this exceptional principle becomes trivialized and thus ultimately loses significance.},

	abstract = {A greater number of explicit references to human dignity can be found in bioethical debates than in virtually any other context. This may have its ground in the subject-matter of bioethical debates, namely, questions of life and death, which undoubtedly concern the dignity of a person. It may, however, also be a consequence of the strong influence that various religions and ideologies have on these debates. It seems that, in bioethics, the term `human dignity' is quite often used in a way that seems to distinguish different ideological camps, which gave rise to the idea that the term would be connected to a conservative-communitarian network with strong links in various religious circles.The underlying problem in discussing the role of human dignity in bioethics is that most approaches in bioethics are not appropriate for developing an adequate understanding of human dignity as a foundational concept from which the human rights are derived. I briefly discuss two examples: Jonsen and Toulmin (1988) claimed that bioethical debates should centre on cases, rather than principles (Düwell 2012: 51–8). They argued that the appropriate way to deal with bioethical cases would be to compare between those cases where we agree in our moral judgments and those cases of medical practice where we are uncertain about what we ought to do. By a critical discussion and comparison of cases it would be much more likely that we would come to an agreement than if we focus on abstract principles and their contested philosophical background theories. Such case-oriented, sometimes even anti-theoretical approaches are quite dominant in bioethics. If human dignity is to be interpreted as a principle from which human rights can be derived, it would be difficult to relate this principle to a case-oriented approach in the first place.},

First, I will explain why we are in need of a philosophical account of human dignity at all. Second, I will distinguish different ideal typical models of (human) dignity. Third, I will distinguish different conceptual questions related to different approaches to human dignity and their philosophical articulations. Fourth, I will investigate some relevant questions on the way towards an ethics of human dignity. Finally, I will propose some topics that I consider to be important questions for future philosophical debates about this concept.Why develop a philosophical account of human dignity?When in 1948 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) was signed, human dignity was introduced as a kind of moral reference point for an agreement that could provide normative guidance for the interpretation of the human rights framework in general. Most people believed that they knew what human dignity was about: a consensus within the humanistic tradition, a secularized version of the Judeo-Christian concept of Imago Dei, an overlap between the ethical doctrines of important thinkers like Kant and Confucius, the normative core of the natural law tradition, a moral–political statement against the atrocities of the Nazi regime etc. Although obviously not everyone endorsed the notion, it was generally assumed that its meaning and status were clear – and thus it appeared superfluous to strive for a theoretical explanation and justification of the concept.},

	abstract = {The questions of whether we have obligations towards future generations, why we have such obligations and what these obligations entail, are important topics of discussion in contemporary moral and political philosophy. While there seems to be political consensus on the view that we are obligated to adopt a policy of sustainability, the reasons why we should endorse such an obligation are highly contested. The dominant argument can be found in the so-called `Brundtland definition' of `sustainable development': `sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs' (United Nations 1987: 37). In this line of thought, the obligation towards future generations is a normative reason for a sustainable politics. Of course, we also have reasons to act sustainably because of the rights of current (particularly the younger) generations, but various aspects of a sustainable politics are only necessary if we take future generations into account. Such an obligation to a long-term sustainable policy would assume that there is something about future generations that gives us obligations towards them. But if we attribute rights to future generations, we would assume that human rights should be attributed to beings that do not and may never exist. This problem is quite extensively discussed in terms of `rights of future generations' or `intergenerational justice' (for example, Grosseries and Meyer 2009; Hiskes 2009) but the concept of human dignity is hardly ever referred to. In the following I will briefly explain (1) the obstacles we are facing if we talk about human dignity in the context of future generations; (2) what such a conceptualization could look like; and (3) what further philosophical and practical issues arise from this.Why should we talk about human dignity in the context of future generations?In providing a normative framework for obligations towards future generations we have basically two options.},

Which legal rules are inconsistent with the right to dignity depends upon the scope of its application. That is: it depends upon whom the right binds. According to the Constitution, every one of the rights in its Bill of Rights, and thus also the right to dignity, binds the state. The Constitution does not, however, say whether the right also binds private persons. As with all the other rights in the Bill of Rights, the question whether the right to dignity binds private persons is left to the courts to determine, `taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right'. Though this is not entirely clear, the South African Constitutional Court seems to have accepted that the right to dignity does bind private persons.},

Disability activists and advocates speak about violation of the human dignity of people with disabilities with regard to involuntary institutionalization, medical treatment without consent, exclusion from education, work and social life, lack of assistance and care, risk of poverty, absence of respect for privacy, home and family, as well as the experience of disregard, disrespect and humiliation. Particularly, in the field of biomedicine and bioethics, disabled persons feel their dignity is violated due to selective abortion and end-of-life decisions based on an understanding of disability as `wrongful life'. They identify the values and perspectives of scientists, physicians and ethicists holding such views as those of well-educated, middle-class members of society who `prize intellect, rationality, and the goal of human health' (Ash 2001: 293). This corresponds to a negative assessment of the quality of life of people with disabilities, which in turn promotes degrading or insulting behaviour towards them (Hubbard 1997).Human dignity is understood here not as an individual attribute or a special right but as the founding moral principle of an adequate human rights framework that is truly inclusive and universal and hence recognizes the particular needs and living conditions of people with diverse impairments. What follows is that, by stating that `someone has dignity', what is expressed is that she or he has to be recognized as a bearer of human rights. And saying `her dignity has been violated' indicates a systematic disregard of human rights.},

	abstract = {A critical comment on the ascription of dignity to non-human living beingsShould dignity be ascribed only to humans or also to non-human living beings? We are faced with this problem if we take note of a recent bioethical discussion about the `dignity of creatures'. This discussion was prompted by an amendment to the Swiss Federal Constitution. A plebiscite of May 1992 had voted into the Constitution that the federal government in its regulations of gene technologies shall take into account the dignity of non-human creatures, that is: of animals, plants and other organisms. The vote for the demand that the dignity of these creatures be taken into account indicates that wide sections of the Swiss population worried about moral problems caused by genetic engineering – in short: whether human beings have a moral obligation to set limits to their interference with the life of animals, plants and other organisms, and, if so, which limits should be set. Hitherto used moral criteria, such as the avoidance of pain and suffering in animals, were thought insufficient for tackling these problems. A more far-reaching criterion was deemed necessary in order to include moral concerns beyond animal pain and suffering. But the fierce debate following the plebiscite showed that it is far from clear what moral content the concept of dignity of non-human creatures should be taken to have. The Swiss authorities commissioned two teams to clarify the concept and to explore its implications for the genetic engineering of non-human creatures. The reports of the teams give expression to two interpretations of the concept that were prevailing in the discussion (Schmidt 2008: 196). The first report (Praetorius and Saladin 1996) tries to determine a concept of dignity of non-human creatures by analogy with a Kantian concept of human dignity. The second report (Balzer, Rippe and Schaber 1998) suggests that the concept should be seen as corresponding with the concept of inherent value of non-human beings. I will describe both interpretations and criticize them for what I take to be their problematic features. Finally, I will raise the question of whether we should ascribe dignity to all living beings or only to human persons, bearing in mind the role of the concept of dignity as a ground for human rights.},

	abstract = {Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) made the dignity of humanity central in his moral philosophy, and his idea has been interpreted and extended in many ways. Here, I sketch a broadly Kantian understanding of his position, noting occasionally alternative interpretations. The main questions are these: (1) What is human dignity? (2) By virtue of what do human beings have dignity? (3) Why believe in human dignity? (4) What are the practical implications?Kant's main themes were these (Kant 2002: 214–45): all persons, regardless of rank or social class, have an equal intrinsic worth or dignity. Human dignity is an innate worth or status that we did not earn and cannot forfeit. Rather, we must strive to make our individual choices worthy of this moral standing, which elevates us above animals and mere things. A fundamental principle of reason and morality, the Categorical Imperative, tells us to treat humanity in each person never merely as a means, but always as an end in itself. We must act as if we were both law-makers and subjects in an ideal moral commonwealth in which the members, as ends in themselves, have dignity rather than mere price. In contrast to market price and other values that are dependent on our personal attachments, Kant calls dignity `an unconditional and incomparable worth' that `admits of no equivalent'. Human dignity is based on the prior thesis that `the moral law', an unconditional command of reason, has an absolute dignity and authority that everyone must respect. This moral law requires respect for human dignity because all human persons, good or bad, must, from the standpoint of practice, be presumed to have the capacities and predispositions of rational autonomy. In treating humanity as an end in itself and following the moral principles of an ideal moral commonwealth, we will be giving appropriate recognition to the autonomy of each person and shaping our lives by general policies that we can rationally regard as permissible for anyone to follow. The fundamental moral law that affirms human dignity has practical implications for both law and individual ethical choices. Legal institutions must interpret, apply and coercively enforce the innate right to freedom of every person, and individuals must respect themselves and others as persons with equal standing under the moral law.},

Yet Darwin insisted that an evolutionary explanation of our moral sense in no way harms ethics; but, rather, gives it a surer foundation. The question of whether Darwin's insights can provide this foundation, or whether they are in fact harmful to ethics, is still discussed today. In what follows, I will look at a particular aspect of this debate, namely, the importance of Darwinism for a Kantian style of dignity ethics.By `Darwinism' I mean an evolutionary theory where natural selection is the central explanatory concept for the development of natural phenomena (including human beings and their behaviour). I will look at this as a scientific theory, not at evolutionary theory as an overall worldview. Some authors, such as Daniel Dennett, have tried to push evolutionary theory in this direction (as a worldview), and argued on its basis for a naturalistic metaphysics which would obviously not be compatible with dignity ethics (Dennett 1996). I will concentrate on the implications of the scientific theory alone.},

It appears in references to what is `above all price', using Kant's term for indicating what is not at our disposition since it is the foundation, not the object of our autonomy (Ricœur 2005: 237). The reference to dignity is not made explicit, but is present in examples of its denial which give rise to the moral feeling of `indignation', and in identifying the limit of tolerance in what is `intolerable' (Ricœur 1996: 198–9). While it does not belong to the terms that are subjected to an analysis of the philosophical problems contained in them, such as `autonomy' and `imputability', it is given a place of immediate evidence: [I]n Kant himself, the subjective side of imputation relies on moral feelings that constitute what he called the rational motives of action. Only one motive, only one reason is considered by Kant: respect. One of the tasks of moral philosophy today would be to enlarge, to expand, the field of moral feelings concerning shame, courage, admiration, enthusiasm, veneration, indignation. These feelings have to do with dignity, a kind of immediate recognition of the dignity of a moral subject.(Ricœur 2002: 287)},

This is particularly true for most of the digital technology that has come to dominate much of the public discourse: for example, the mobile phone, the Internet and social networks.In recognition of its role in freedom of expression, individual autonomy and development and recognizing its value in social participation and democratic participation, a discussion has arisen as to whether access to the Internet should be made into a right: whether states have the responsibility to guarantee that Internet access is broadly available.

The concept has high value, and has been central to (at least Western) legal thinking since the approval of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948 (Cançado Trindade 2008: 11). As all South American constitutions currently in force were established after the UDHR, we suggest that human dignity plays a central role in those constitutions as well, and thus in the legal orders of all countries on the South American continent.In order to support this claim, this chapter will focus primarily on comparative constitutional law, but it will also look at selected examples of uses of the notion of dignity in other legal contexts. Our central contention is that the concept of human dignity has evolved as an axiological (as a core value or fundamental principle) and normative foundation (as a fundamental right or rule) of the legal systems of South American countries, and that, even though theoretically under-developed, the notion has been used extensively by lawyers and judges. This `under-comprehension' of the concept, however, has led to the reduction of its normative value and even threatens to nullify it altogether, at least before the eyes of society at large (cf. Lorenzetti 1998: 166).},

	abstract = {From a sociological point of view, human dignity is to be grasped as a societal phenomenon, the analysis of which is concerned with identifying the historical circumstances for the emergence of the concept of human dignity. The assumption that every living human being is `born free and equal in dignity and rights' is understood as a normative social institution. In other words, from a sociological perspective, human dignity is conceived as a structural feature of modern societies, which are characterized by functional differentiation. The latter is either defined by an advanced division of labour (Durkheim 1930), or by the idea that there are diverse thematic fields of communication such as science, politics, law, economy, family etc., that are all assumed to be structured by different patterns of action/communication (Luhmann 1997). Functional differentiation requires that human beings recognize each other as individuals who are able to follow different patterns of action/communication. As individuals they are expected to be able to act not only as a scientist, but also as a mother, a shareholder or a member of a political party etc. The role of expectations within different realms of action are diverse and even contradictory and it is up to the individual to manage this complexity. Emile Durkheim (1950) argued that such societies first evolved in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Europe and North America, a thesis that was subsequently developed further by Niklas Luhmann (1965). According to Durkheim and Luhmann, the structure of functional differentiation demands that there be individuals whose dignity is recognized. This idea forms the current basis of sociological reasoning on human dignity (Verschraegen 2002; Joas 2008; Lindemann 2010a).If each single member of the human family is assumed to be born free and equal in dignity and rights, identifying someone as a member of the human family serves as a generally valid criterion for delimiting the circle of those beings that have to be recognized as beings with dignity. Two questions arise with regard to this premise: (1) Do sociological accounts offer a description of how the subject of human dignity is identified? In other words, how did the idea of one human family consisting of equal members arise? (2) How does sociology understand the meaning of the predicate `human dignity'? In other words, what does it mean to say that each member is equally endowed with inalienable human dignity?},

Since the new beginning of international law after the Second World War, universal human dignity has been tied to the possession of human rights. Human dignity as a `basis' of human rights is a morally grounded norm enacted as nationally and internationally applicable law through the shaping of political will. To respect, protect and guarantee these rights are in the first instance duties of the respective state, second of all states, and by means of a `horizontal effect' of all humans as well. The content of `human dignity' refers to the capabilities of humans for free, reflected self-determination, to their equal legal recognition and self-recognition and to the conditions of a minimum subsistence level which allow a life worthy of human dignity (in German, menschenwürdiges Leben).`Socialism' is an equally encompassing concept applicable to different conceptions of society which aspire to a social organization of the economy, of ownership structures, of society and/or of the state in criticism of capitalism and its associated individualism. Historically, the concept first appears as a category of philosophy of law (sozialismo, A. Buonafede, 1798), following Hugo Grotius and Samuel Pufendorf, in order to establish natural law on the basis of sociability against catholic views (Schnieder 1984). In England, the concept has been used only since 1837 for the designation of Robert Owen's visions of society (Cole 1962). The development of socialist movements and corresponding conceptions range from early socialism (or, in Engels' terms, `utopian socialism', 1789–1848) in France, Marx' scientific socialism and numerous variations (anarchistic socialism, state socialism, reform socialism, market socialism, democratic socialism etc.), the creation of labour unions and socialist, communist or social democrat parties in Europe to the present (Schnieder 1984; Wildt 2008). The different conceptions of socialism have highly differing normative ideas and demands.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-19578-2},
	abstract = {The core of Chinese Confucianism concerns personhood: it addresses questions as to how to conduct oneself and what kind of person one should be. The basic notions of Chinese Confucianism are benevolence, righteousness, ritual, wisdom and integrity. The Confucian concept of human dignity is deeply interwoven with these core concepts of Confucianism. Human dignity in Confucianism addresses core questions of Confucian convictions such as how to deal with life and death, honour and disgrace, loyalty etc. This chapter will present central doctrines to these questions of the main representatives of Confucianism and attempt to disclose how human dignity may be conceived in this tradition.Confucius: human dignity and benevolenceAlthough Confucianism affirms that all human life is valuable, in case of conflict, in cases wherein one has to risk his life in order to uphold benevolence and righteousness, the latter take priority over life itself. `Benevolence' in Confucianism indicates care for other people and social groups. Fan Chi, a student of Confucius, once asked his master as to the meaning of benevolence. The master responded that benevolence means to love people: benevolence means to love genuinely or authentically, to desire the well-being of others without seeking to profit from their well-being oneself. The virtue of benevolence is what makes life valuable: a life without benevolence is a life not worth living. Thus, Confucius claims that `for gentlemen of purpose and men of benevolence, while it is inconceivable that they should seek to stay alive at the expense of benevolence, it may happen that they have to accept death in order to accomplish benevolence' (Confucius 2008: 15: 9). In circumstances wherein a specific person does not live in accordance with the requirements of benevolence or even acts in opposition to these, his life is no longer valuable: a life without benevolence is a life without dignity. Hence, even in the tragic situation wherein the act of benevolence would entail death, Confucianism holds that benevolence is morally overriding because the alternative – an undignified life – is hardly a life at all. However, benevolence cannot be externally enforced; Confucius says that `the practice of benevolence depends on oneself alone, and not on others' (Confucius 2008: 12: 1). To live in accordance with dignity depends wholly on the individual person: benevolence can only have its ground in free choice.},

After long discussion, the Bureau of the IUA modified the subject-matter of the investigation by converting it to a project to investigate human dignity, so as to give the opportunity to non-European academies to participate. The General Assembly of the IUA accepted the project in this form.The project is unique amongst the projects patronized by the IUA for several reasons. The investigation is not being carried out by two or more interested academies according to a previously fixed timetable, but rather is open to all member academies. At the start of the project, with the financial aid of the European Science Foundation (ESF), three meetings of experts were organized by the Bureau of the IUA in cooperation with three member academies, as follows: `Human Dignity: Religious and Historical Aspects', Jerusalem, 17–18 December 2006, organized by G.

Moreover, the rationale for producing Islamic alternatives is challenged by Muslims who embrace the UDHR as consonant with their faith along with the concept of dignity that is linked to the human rights that it sets forth.The idea that Islam possesses its own distinctive version of human rights has been promoted by conservative forces in Muslim societies that seek to uphold rules of Islamic law, or Shariʿa, that are in conflict with the UDHR. In league with some of these conservative forces, governments of Muslim countries have sponsored alternative declarations and resolutions that rely on Islamic elements to rationalize non-compliance with the UDHR, eliminating some UDHR rights and circumscribing others. Where the concept of dignity figures in such declarations, because it accommodates inequality and restrictions on rights, it takes on colourations unlike those of dignity in the UDHR.},

This frequency stands in clear contrast to the fact that Arendt herself only very rarely speaks about the dignity of human beings – in distinction, for example, from the `dignity of the political' which she investigates and defends in many of her works (Villa 2000). The most prominent of the rare passages in which Arendt does speak of human dignity appears in the foreword to the first edition of The Origins of Totalitarianism (1951). Towards the end of this foreword, she writes that: Antisemitism (and not merely the hatred of Jews), imperialism (not merely conquest), totalitarianism (not merely dictatorship) – one after the other, one more brutally than the other – have demonstrated that human dignity needs a new guarantee which can only be found in a new political principle, in a new law on earth, whose validity this time must comprehend the whole of humanity while its power must remain strictly limited, rooted in and controlled by newly defined territorial entities.(Arendt 1958b: ix)Precisely this emphatic formulation, which links the idea of human dignity to the struggle against anti-Semitism, imperialism and totalitarianism, has, however, already `been dropped' (Arendt 1986: 13) by the 1955 German edition of the book. In the major books that Arendt dedicated to the essence of the political – from The Human Condition (1958a) through On Revolution (1967) to Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy (1982) – the question of human dignity is only addressed in passing, if indeed at all.},

The term `ubuntu' is often used to concisely sum up a particular view of what is morally fundamental, roughly, to live a genuinely human way of life or to become a real person.As one would expect of a large and diverse region such as sub-Saharan Africa, conceptions of what (genuine) humanness or (real) personhood consists of are far from uniform. Nonetheless, there are certain ideas associated with talk of `ubuntu' and related terms that one encounters recurrently, and they are what I focus on here, particularly insofar as they bear on the value of dignity as the ground of human rights articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948.},

	abstract = {Human dignity in the late Middle Ages: mysticism and the law of nationsRecently, medievalists have started to address the question of individuality in the Middle Ages. They broadly agree that Leopold von Ranke, Jakob Burkhardt and others were misguided in understanding the Renaissance as a break with the dark medieval collectivism. The same holds – to an extent that is yet to be determined – for the understanding and justification of human dignity. In the Middle Ages, a number of perspectives arise that break ground for the idea of dignity and equality between humans. At the same time, though, there are numerous medieval approaches that vigorously challenge such ideas.The Church Fathers connected the ancient idea that human beings have a special place in the world because of their rational capacities and their ability for self-formation (the Stoics, Cicero), with the Christian doctrine of the human being as created in the image of God (imago Dei) or the redeemed (baptized) human as similar to God (similitudo). That is, by participating in God in being His image, human beings at the same time participate in God's reason. Humans have the capacity to reflect on themselves, and to exercise free will (liberum arbitrium). The particular theory of human dignity as springing from freedom – especially the individual's freedom of the will and his capacity for self-determination and self-knowledge – does not (as is often assumed) originate from Pico della Mirandola's work, De hominis dignitate, but can already be found in Alcuin of York's De dignitate conditionis humanae (cf. Marenbon 1981), as well as in several twelfth-century texts. Peter Abelard develops an account of the will as a reflexive structure and the unity of human beings as rational creatures. The `I' in this theory – the conscious and reflexive relation of people to their own will – is determined by rationality, which humans employ to evaluate possible actions and to decide to act in a particular way. Yet such a secundum rationem agere was already identified by Pseudo-Dionysus as the ethical capacity of the human being; one that is not only a form of freedom, but also a responsibility.},

It carefully attends to the nature of consciousness as actually experienced, not as represented by the tradition or abstract philosophizing or scientific theory. This leads to a method in philosophy: the careful description of things or their meanings as they appear to a `transcendentally reduced' (Husserl 1991: 34 passim) consciousness, i.e. minus all prejudices and theoretical assumptions, while taking their very manner of appearance into consideration. But how does phenomenology shed light on something like the meaning of human dignity? If human dignity is not something I have to infer but something directly intuited in experience, how is it that human beings inhabit my experience in such a way that they present themselves to me as beings worthy of respect, possessing certain rights and generating correlative duties and obligations, which are essential components of their recognition?},

About fifty years after the `discovery' of `America', a disputation was organized by King Charles I of Spain (1500–58) at the Colegio de San Gregorio in the Spanish city of Valladolid during the period of 1550 to 1551. He assembled a junta (council) of fourteen distinguished theologians who were specialists in Catholic canon law – the Consejo Real de las Indias (also known as the `Council of the Fourteen') – with the purpose of issuing a ruling whether the methods of war and conquest of America were just. Another important subject was the manner in which the indigenous American peoples were to be converted to Catholicism as had been demanded by various papal bulls. The current situation in colonial `Spanish America' was enforced conversion to Christianity, compulsory labour, tribute and violent treatment of indigenous people within the encomienda system. King Charles I suspended the war and conquest in Spanish America until these concerns were to be resolved at the Council of Valladolid (Hanke 1959; Losada 1971; Williams 1990; Veiteberg 1994).},

Using one meaning, we say that each human being has an inherent dignity, which is inalienable and equal for all. Using the other meaning, we say that the dignity of human beings is precarious and stands in need of social protection.We find both meanings used side by side in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR). In the first three occurrences of the word, it is used in its first sense: recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world(UDHR, Preamble, paragraph 1)the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person and in the equal rights of men and women(UDHR, Preamble, paragraph 5)[a]ll human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights(UDHR, Article 1)In the next occurrence, `dignity' is used in its other sense: Everyone, as a member of society, has the right to social security and is entitled to realization, through national effort and international cooperation and in accordance with the organization and resources of each State, of the economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality.(UDHR, Article 22)To call these rights indispensable for dignity is to say that any person lacking in these rights also falls short in dignity. Article 22 thus suggests that dignity is both alienable and possibly unequal: those who have dignity can lose its indispensable preconditions and therefore dignity itself – and will then not be `equal in dignity' with those who still have it.},

As a foreignism, many scholars conceive the main function of dignity to be the communication of modern European ideas of human dignity, especially that of Kantian philosophy, to contemporary China which is thought to lack such ideas. Thus, in the Ci-Hai (辞海, literally a `sea of terms'), one of the few comprehensive Chinese dictionaries, the second definition of this word is: `The recognition and affirmation of the moral and social value of an individual or a social organization; The acknowledgment of the value of human life as the most fundamental dignity of human beings' (Ci-Hai 2000: 2300). The Ci-Hai mentions nothing of the Chinese tradition of the concept, as if it does not play a role in Chinese philosophy. This would be a misunderstanding: a notion of dignity is central in both Confucianism and Daoism. The Confucian concept of dignity is similar to the one we find in Kantian philosophy: dignity is understood as human dignity and strongly related to action. In the Daoist tradition, `dignity' functions very differently, but this does not mean, I will suggest, that it is of no interest to our understanding of the concept. Quite the contrary: the Daoist conception of dignity could contribute to the global discussion of the concept precisely because it offers a different perspective.I will first briefly attempt to outline the general features of the idea of Dao, and second discuss the substance and role of dignity in Daoism.},

Paragraph 1 of the article states: The federal government shall issue regulations on the use of the genetic material of animals, plants, and other organisms. It thereby shall take into account, the dignity of non-human beings [`die Würde der Kreatur'] as well as the safety of human beings, animals, and the environment, and shall protect the genetic diversity of animal and plant species.According to the legal interpretation, the dignity of non-human beings pertains to all individual organisms, animals, plants and micro-organisms. What is meant by the dignity of non-human beings? How does it relate to human dignity? And why should we ascribe it to all non-human beings? If animals had dignity, their moral status might be the same or at least close to the one humans have. They might have, provided that dignity is the basis of human rights, the same rights humans have. On the other hand, if they do not have dignity, the rights humans have might trump the claims that could be made on behalf of animals.Non-human and human dignityOne might argue that the dignity of non-human beings is just an extension of the concept of human dignity. What we ascribe to humans when we talk of their dignity is also something that should be ascribed to non-humans. Of course, the meaning of the concept of human dignity is contested. But, one could argue, whatever turns out to be the proper understanding of human dignity, it should also be ascribed to non-humans. But why should we do this? Advocates of the view that we should extend dignity to all living organisms give two reasons: first, humans would not have the properties due to which they have dignity if there were no other living organisms. Dignity pertains also to the necessary conditions of the properties which convey dignity to humans. Second, Living organisms have their own teleonomic structure, they are beings that pursue their own ends.},

This discussion will examine those subject-matter areas that feature human dignity as a legal concept, and will identify possible legal conceptual analogues in the American system (for example, liberty and equality).Which sense of `dignity'?It is necessary briefly to identify two of the principal competing definitions of `human dignity' in order to better understand its usage in American law. A useful way to divide the manifold approaches to human dignity is to distinguish those conceptions that treat dignity as a contingent human quality from those that regard it as an intrinsic attribute of human beings.},

Ultimately, a person possessing dignity must not be an offset against somebody else. She may not be sacrificed for the sake of another person or other persons. Thus, her dignity constitutes a strict limit to the actions of others. Furthermore, mutual positive duties derive from the dignity of a person. Accordingly, dignity is the basis of claim rights, since the normative concept of dignity is explicated by determinate claim rights. At the same time, one can gather from the concept of dignity how rights are to be understood as a whole, which requirements any adequate theory of claim rights must fulfil, and what the mutual duties between the bearers of dignity and rights are. The following are the four most important principles which accrue from the normative concept of dignity.First, the normative concept of dignity is not gradable. It is impossible for one being to possess more dignity than another. Rather, all beings that possess dignity possess the same dignity and the same fundamental rights. Thus, a fundamental normative equality exists between each bearer of dignity.},

	abstract = {A particular challenge of considering human dignity and gender inequalities together lies in the fact that discussions about gender inequalities rarely make any reference to human dignity. Another difficulty arises from the expansiveness and variegated nature of the category of `gender inequalities'. As groups, women and gender minorities still face inequalities in many areas of daily life, but the institutional, social, material and psychological aspects of these inequalities differ greatly among various geographical, economic and cultural contexts. `Gender' as a category of difference and a basis for unequal treatment cannot and should not be reduced to mean only women, but the debates, especially in the context of international human rights, have to date focused almost entirely on women's rights and women's empowerment, leaving gender minorities in the margins. Yet while human dignity and gender inequalities have seldom been discussed in connection with each other, the perspective of gender can offer a critical heuristic to examine how appeals to dignity might implicitly and inadvertently reinscribe norms of gender, race, class, ableness, sex and sexuality. With this critical perspective in place, dignity as a philosophical concept can be productive in a feminist context to foreground the relation among social respect, self-respect and agency as central to ongoing emancipatory struggles (cf. Cornell 2002). Laying claim to one's dignity, regardless of one's gender, can attain the force of a critical moral act, particularly in situations where individuals are socially, culturally or politically denied the freedom of enacting a moral vision of themselves and the world. Just as the full enactment and experience of one's own dignity requires social respect, social respect without self-respect remains a limited actualization of an individual's human dignity. To the extent that it is useful to approach gender inequalities as infringements on individuals' human dignity, abolishing inequalities requires social and cultural changes alongside legal, political and economic advances. To circumscribe the relationship between human dignity and gender inequalities, this chapter will first consider key United Nations (UN) documents to trace the conceptual expansion in the treatment of gender issues from that of equal rights and the protection of individuals from violence to a broader agenda of women's empowerment. The second part of the chapter will outline the conceptual difficulties in drawing on the concept of human dignity in the struggle to overcome gender inequalities.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-19578-2},
	abstract = {If civilization is to be salvaged, the new age of civilization will have to be an age of theocentric humanism. Today, human dignity is trampled under foot far and wide. Even worse, it collapses from the inside, for guided by the pure perspective of science and technology we are at a loss when it comes to discovering the rational foundations of the dignity of the person, and to believing in these.(Maritain 1990: vol. IX, 363)This text, uneasy, written at the end of the Second World War as bolshevist totalitarianism spread over large parts of Europe, clearly marks the twofold character of Maritain's approach to dignity: rooted in a lucid and bemused view of historical actuality, it calls for philosophical, metaphysical and even theological steps towards finding an adequate response to the challenges of the present; challenges which science and technology are incapable of meeting. As such, Maritain the metaphysician (and theologian) is inseparable from Maritain the political watchdog – and even agent, since he was one of the indirect architects of the 1948 Charter of the United Nations on account of his membership of a UNESCO enquiry commission on human rights. His concern for human dignity, therefore, does not ignore the diversity of conceptions and practices made manifest to him by his experience with the preparation of the Charter. Yet, at the same time, the philosopher is convinced that, without a strong metaphysical foundation, the concept of dignity risks being effaced from the human consciousness. It is with this metaphysical and historical background in mind that Maritain's philosophy of dignity ought to be approached.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-19578-2},
	abstract = {Any discussion of Rousseau (1712–78) in connection with the notions of `human dignity' and `human rights' runs up against two problems. First of all, Rousseau rejects the idea that man would have an exalted place in nature – in fact, even primitive man is in a way disadvantaged as compared to other animals. The second problem is that Rousseau rejects the traditional notion of `natural right' as an ideological ploy to protect the rich against the poor. These two problems are of course intimately connected, dignity, as conferred by reason and language, being since Grotius (1583–1645) the feature that serves as the basis of natural right. Nonetheless – and this is the real puzzle – the shadow of Rousseau hovers over any modern debate on human rights.Man's natural conditionMany modern representatives of the natural right tradition make use of the idea of a state of nature, basically in two different ways. Either they postulate that in their `natural state' men are driven by egoistic passions and engaged in a continual war of all against all, or they believe that by his very nature man is guided by the rule of reason and that he seeks a relation with his fellow men that corresponds to his specific dignity. In both cases, the creation of a civil society and a body politic would be a deliberate break with the past, which would be motivated either, as in Hobbes (1588–1679), by man's natural inclination to preserve his own being; or, as in Grotius and Locke (1632–1704), by the wish to protect and consolidate values of which man is naturally aware. Although therefore civil society is an artifact and in many respects constitutes a break with `nature' it is in a way also `natural', either because it embodies values inherent in human nature (the rule of reason), or because it is the prolongation, albeit with different means, of individual action; the enactment of a natural obligation or the best way to protect our own interests. In either case, we would sacrifice some of our `natural' freedom but have something better in return, like safety, prosperity and culture.},

	isbn = {978-0-521-19578-2},
	abstract = {The notion of `posthuman dignity' first appeared in a paper entitled `In Defense of Posthuman Dignity', which Nick Bostrom published in 2005 in the Journal Bioethics. In this paper, he stresses that neither means nor ends of enhancement technologies advocated by the exponents of the transhumanist or posthumanist movement endanger human dignity or the fundamental human rights derived from it (Bostrom 2005).As the concept of `human dignity' as well as that of `enhancement' are controversial and the answer to the question of whether radically enhancing human nature violates human dignity depends on the definition of these two notions, in the following I will try to clarify these key concepts in the context of the enhancement debate. Whereas the notion of enhancement is relatively well defined by its proponents, the different argumentations put forward to explain human dignity will lead us to the question of human nature and its moral status.},

	title = {Natural rights versus human dignity: {Two} conflicting traditions},
	isbn = {978-0-521-19578-2},
	abstract = {`All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.' In the famous first article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), human dignity is mentioned in the same breath as human rights. But what exactly is the relationship between dignity and rights? Are we to endow human beings with dignity because human beings possess certain inalienable rights, or is it the other way round: are we to guarantee people their rights because of their inherent human dignity; an indefinable quality that is proper to human beings alone and by which they are elevated above other natural beings? The relation between the two remains close but obscure. Furthermore, and more importantly: what exactly are we asked to do? It seems that the reader is only presented with a certain state of affairs. Human dignity is presupposed to `exist', and all we have to do is to `understand', to `acknowledge' and to `recognize' it. But, if so, we may ask, with Dylan: where do we find it? Isn't it true that we can only hope to find dignity as a result of the way we treat people? Why are we admonished to begin with dignity as a starting-point? Why aren't we simply told that human dignity is a desirable result; an aim to strive for? Aren't we running in circles by pretending that something is there which should still be realized?In order to shed some light on these perplexities, it is instructive to take a look at the developments that took place in seventeenth-century natural law theories, which contributed to the vocabulary and style of the UDHR. First, I will briefly sketch the stage on which seventeenth-century natural law thinkers had to play. Then, I will analyze the role of the notion of human nature in the theories of Hugo Grotius and John Locke and its relation to the formulation of natural rights. It will be shown that the formulation of those rights is in no way dependent on the assumption of human dignity. Matters are, however, different for Samuel Pufendorf. In his theory, the notion of human dignity is central. As will be shown, this dignity is God-given and consists in the capacity to understand God's will.},
