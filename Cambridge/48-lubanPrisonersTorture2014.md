### Treatment of prisoners and torture DAVID LUBAN

For entirely obvious reasons, the first substantive article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) proclaims 'the right to life, liberty and security of person'. Nothing, we think, can be more basic. Other articles of the UDHR spell out what liberty and security mean. Article 5 declares that 'no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment'. To most of us, this protection belongs side by side with the rights to life and liberty at the very core of international human rights. A similar clause protecting against torture appears in other human rights instruments around the world – in the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights as well as in the regional human rights conventions of Africa, Europe and the Americas.

The UDHR, like other human rights instruments, also proclaims that concern for human dignity lies at the foundation of human rights. That is a philosophical proposition, and it raises profound questions about the nature of human dignity and why human rights are rooted in it.1 Among the puzzles is how (if at all) we can deduce particular human rights from the concept of human dignity. Why, in particular, do torture and cruel punishment violate human dignity? The evils of physical torture scarcely need philosophical explanation, and they are not specific to human beings and our dignity: torturing a dog is also evil, and it is evil for much the same reason as torturing a human. The evil lies in the infliction of pain and suffering on a sentient being, not in the affront to dignity – or so the objection might go to a human-dignity-based analysis. One could even object that focusing on the victim's dignity rather than her pain and suffering is overly refined or downright evasive. I shall argue that focusing on dignity is not at all evasive. But the connection between the evils of torture and human dignity clearly requires explanation.

Therefore, in both cases – torture and cruel treatment of prisoners – we must explain how and why they violate human dignity – in other words, what the connection is between the specific evils associated with the rights violations and human dignity. As we shall see, the connection lies in the fact that cruel

practices assault basic aspects of the human personality, and do so to deny the equal dignity of the victim.

#### **Life sentences without parole**

A good place to begin is with an important 1977 decision of the German Constitutional Court, which held that life sentences without the possibility of parole are unconstitutional. The Court relied on the first two articles of the German Constitution: Article 1(1) states, '[h]uman dignity shall be inviolable', and Article 2(1) guarantees the right of free development of the personality. The Court reasoned that the two articles together impose a duty on the state to rehabilitate prisoners, and 'the state strikes at the heart of human dignity if it treats the prisoner without regard to the development of his personality and strips him of all hope of ever earning his freedom'.2 Life without parole violates human dignity because it assumes that the prisoner is, quite literally, beyond redemption, his personality incapable of free development.

The image of human dignity embedded in the German decision focuses on the nature of the human personality. Unlike Stoics such as Cicero, who thought it is reason that endows us with human dignity, or Epictetus, who thought it is the unshakeable will, the German Constitutional Court emphasized the dynamic and changing nature of the human personality, its capacity to renew itself and make itself into something no longer cabined by its own past deeds. Only the recognition of this feature 'makes the sentence bearable in terms of human dignity'.

The psychological insight associated with this view is that, without hope of self-transformation and self-transcendence, we cannot set goals, and without goals we cannot form motivations. We would simply be serving time until death ends the sentence, and indeed static hopelessness is closely related to endlessness, the 'tedium of immortality' that the philosopher Bernard Williams famously argued would make eternal life unbearable (Williams 1973: 82–100). Lacking motivations, our personalities would stand at risk of disintegration. Plainly, not everyone sentenced to life without parole actually disintegrates. Some prisoners find ways to hold hopelessness at bay. Famously, Epictetus maintained that imprisonment cannot touch the virtuous person's dignity (Epictetus 1877: 6). Perhaps lifelong prisoners maintain themselves through some version of stoic detachment. Others do it through religious faith, angry defiance or (one suspects) stubborn self-deception. Some prisoners, on the other hand, simply deteriorate.

In addition to assaulting psychological integrity, life without parole treats the prisoner as a lesser being than his fellows, and condemns him to lifelong

subordination. Importantly, the UDHR systematically ties 'inherent dignity' to 'equal rights'. Where concern about psychological integrity emphasizes a personal and existential meaning of individual human dignity, the emphasis on equality means that human dignity is the common possession of all human beings in equal measure – a relational sense of human dignity. The two go together: destroying someone's personality reduces her to a lower level, and systematic subordination assaults the personality.

#### **Dehumanizing conditions of confinement**

Conditions less drastic than lifetime confinement can also assault the personality. Long-term solitary confinement (used in the United States on an estimated 25,000 residents of 'supermax' prisons and additional tens of thousands in other facilities) can cause rapid deterioration of the personality. Psychologist Craig Haney explains:

Some of them lose their grasp of their identity. Who we are, and how we function in the world around us, is very much nested in our relation to other people. Over a long period of time, solitary confinement undermines one's sense of self. It undermines your ability to register and regulate emotion. The appropriateness of what you're thinking and feeling is difficult to index, because we're so dependent on contact with others for that feedback. And for some people, it becomes a struggle to maintain sanity. (Kelm 2009) 3

Other conditions of imprisonment besides life without parole and long-term solitary confinement can also assault the human personality. In its well-known *Soering* decision, the European Court of Human Rights barred the United Kingdom from extraditing a German to face a potential death sentence for a double murder. The Court found that the 'death row phenomenon' of waiting for years in the death house, literally in the shadow of death, amounts to inhuman and degrading treatment.4 (For legal reasons, the Court could not address the death penalty itself.)

In the most extreme form of prisoner mistreatment, concentration camp conditions aim to dehumanize inmates as well as making them suffer. As explained by Avishai Margalit and Gabriel Moskin, humiliating the victims as a sign of their expulsion from the human race was an essential, not accidental, part of the Holocaust, because it made the category of 'murder' inapplicable: only a being with human dignity can be murdered (Margalit and Motzkin 1996: 70–6).

Inmates' compelled degradation forms one of the themes of Primo Levi's powerful books on his experiences in Auschwitz. With too few calories to go around, nobody could survive without stealing food from other inmates. Auschwitz became a Hobbesian hell that morally degraded those it did not kill;

<sup>3</sup> See also Gawande 2009.

Levi asserts that few survivors could claim innocence because the innocent did not survive – in Levi's unforgettable language, they were the drowned, and only those who found some form of special protection were the saved (Levi 1958: 87–100; 1989: 40–1)

Forcing prisoners to sacrifice moral integrity to survive is different from an attack on the personality as such, although innumerable inmates suffered lasting psychological damage. But it is an important example of a phenomenon systematically connected with degrading practices of confinement, and torture as well: degradation induces behaviour by prisoners that makes them contemptible in their guards' eyes, and their contemptible condition seemingly justifies the abuse. This vicious circle of dehumanization justifying further dehumanization is extremely important in sustaining inhuman systems. The victims themselves provide the evidence that they deserve their treatment.

#### **The defining evils of torture**

Harsh punishment and degrading treatment are closely connected with torture, and may in fact be forms of torture. Torture was, of course, a common method of punishment until its abolition in the nineteenth century.

The paradigm case of torture is physical torture, not more intangible assaults on dignity. It leads us again to the question of why the evil of inflicting so much suffering on a sentient being requires explanation through the concept of human dignity – or, indeed, any explanation at all. The answer is that the evil of torture cannot be reduced to the pain alone. Consider that women whom no one would deem irrational choose natural childbirth despite the pain; its association with a joyful event transforms excruciating pain into something they do not regard as unalloyed evil. The evil of physical torture lies in the connection between pain, fear and the horror of being wholly in the power of a malignant enemy. The Stoics recognized this. Seneca observed that even the Stoic sage loses his courage when he sees the instruments of torture displayed, and 'the spectacle overcomes those who would have patiently withstood the suffering' (Seneca 1917: 87). He observes that diseases can be as painful as torture, but

that which shakes us most is the dread which hangs over us from our neighbour's ascendancy [lit. 'another's power', *aliena potentia*]; for it is accompanied by great outcry and uproar . . . Picture to yourself under this head the prison, the cross, the rack, the hook, and . . . all the other contrivances devised by cruelty . . . It is not surprising that our greatest terror is of such a fate. (Seneca 1917: 85)

Notably, Seneca emphasizes suffering aggravated by imagination, and he associates the horrors of torture with being in another's power and having that power put on display. Bearing these observations in mind, I shall define torture as follows:

Torture is the assertion of unlimited power over absolute helplessness, accomplished through the infliction of severe pain or suffering on a victim in the torturer's custody or control that the victim is meant to perceive as the assertion of the torturer's limitless power and the victim's absolute helplessness.

This is a different and more complicated definition than the standard legal definition of torture as intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering. It is not intended to replace the legal definition, which serves its own purposes, which we shall examine shortly. The definition offered here means to capture the distinctive evil of torture, which lies in the connection between suffering, domination and unlimited helplessness. Torture is pain used as a communicative vehicle to let its victims know that they are wholly at the mercy of the merciless. The definition offered here makes it clear how torture violates human dignity in both senses described above: it inflicts suffering to make visible the victim's helplessness and it does so to assert absolute inequality.5

The definition offered here encompasses mental as well as physical torture. So long as the mental suffering is severe, and is inflicted to communicate the absolute dominance of the torturer and helplessness of the victim, it qualifies as torture.

Historically, rulers have inflicted torture for four reasons in addition to punishment: the celebration of military triumph by torturing the defeated, terrorizing subjugated people to maintain political control, extracting criminal confessions, and intelligence-gathering (Luban 2005: 1432–7). That the first two satisfy the definition of torture offered here should be clear. As for interrogational torture, its point is to replace the victim's will with the interrogator's, so that, as Jean Amery (himself a torture victim) remarks, the torturer 'is master ´ over flesh and spirit, life and death' (Amery ´ 1980: 35). More subtly, the philosopher David Sussman argues that the defining evil of interrogational torture lies in forcing the victim 'into the position of colluding against himself through his own affects and emotions, so that he experiences himself as simultaneously powerless and yet actively complicit in his own violation' (Sussman 2005: 4). The victim is not only humbled, but forced to betray himself. Although there is clearly something to this argument, focusing solely on the subordination of will and feeling misses what I take to be a central feature of all these forms of torture: they use pain and suffering as a medium to communicate the mastery of the torturer and abjectness of the victim.

It would be na¨ıve to suppose that any of these practices of cruel triumph, terror, confession or interrogation has died out, but all except the last have lost any semblance of respectability. Within today's political debates, focused on defeating terrorism, only torture for intelligence-gathering still finds unashamed defenders.6

#### **Torture, cruel treatment and the law**

Officially, however, no state condones torture even for interrogation. In addition to the human rights treaties, the 1988 Convention Against Torture (CAT) has more than 150 parties. CAT makes torture an international crime, requires states to criminalize torture, licenses universal jurisdiction over torture, and categorically asserts that no war or other emergency can ever justify torture. Under current international law, torture has entered the small infernal circle of *jus cogens* crimes – violations whose prohibition no custom or treaty can undo. Other treaties reinforce this commitment by branding torture a war crime or a crime against humanity in the contexts of armed conflict or attacks against civilian populations.7

CAT defines torture as the intentional infliction of severe mental or physical pain or suffering (Article 1).8 Importantly, CAT identifies a separate category of 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' (CIDTP) less severe than torture. States are required to criminalize torture, but not CIDTP; instead, CAT obligates states to 'undertake to prevent' CIDTP in any territory over which they have jurisdiction.

Other legal instruments also distinguish between torture and other forms of cruelty, but without suggesting that states have lesser obligations towards CIDTP than torture. Thus, the Geneva Conventions speak of 'cruel treatment and torture' in a separate clause from 'outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment' (Article 3 common to all four Geneva Conventions), with no suggestion that one clause takes priority over the other. The European Convention on Human Rights treats torture and inhuman or degrading treatment together, although the European Court of Human Rights created a three-tiered hierarchy of abuse, with torture at the top, serious inhuman treatment in the intermediate position and lesser inhuman or degrading treatment at the bottom.9 Neither the Geneva Conventions nor the European Convention suggests that torture must be criminalized, while

- 8 CAT adds: ' . . . at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity'. Presumably the restriction to public officials appears in CAT only because treaties obligate states, not private parties. CAT's definition exempts pain or suffering 'inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions'.

states must only 'undertake to prevent' CIDTP. The Geneva Conventions and the European Convention leave torture undefined, and today the authoritative legal definition is the one found in CAT. Its basic formula – 'severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental . . . intentionally inflicted' – has become canonical.

Notoriously, lawyers in the US government concluded that a dozen abusive techniques used by the CIA, including waterboarding (controlled suffocation) and sleep deprivation of up to 180 hours did not cross the 'severity' threshold into torture. One problem with CAT's two-tiered classification scheme in which torture is a crime while CIDTP is not is that it invites pettifoggery in drawing the line. It creates an opening for intelligence services to use so-called 'torture lite' techniques that leave no scars, break no bones, and do not obviously sound awful. (Of course, some forms of bloodless torture, such as electrical shocks, are incontrovertibly torture.) Historian Darius Rejali has shown that democratic regimes pioneered the push towards 'stealth' torture. Perversely, as the law moved to prohibit torture, interrogators moved towards methods that leave no evidence and, if discovered, are less likely to shock the public conscience (Rejali 2007: 405–9).

#### **Mental torture**

One crucial refinement has been the development of mental or psychological torture (Luban and Shue 2012: 823–63). An important boost came from psychological research on 'learned helplessness', which originated in experiments in which dogs, subjected to random electrical shocks unconnected with their behaviour, soon became so passive that they no longer even tried to avoid the shocks. Cold War researchers (some funded by the CIA) discovered that seemingly minor disorientations like hooding, temperature manipulation, isolation and irregular hours of being woken up could induce personality collapses in astonishingly short periods of time (McCoy 2006; Bloche 2011: Chapters 7 and 8). The same is true of physical insults and humiliations piled one on top of another, such as slapping, grabbing, forced nudity, forced grooming and sexual taunting. Cumulatively, humiliation, disorientation and 'torture lite' techniques like stress positions – none of which might independently qualify as torture – have a devastating effect on those subjected to them, reducing them to an infantile state.

By this point, it should be evident that the forms of mistreatment we have examined – life without parole, prolonged isolation, compelled moral degradation, humiliating punishments, and 'stealth' torture – have family resemblances. They attack the personality and make a mockery of human equality. Less dramatic than physical torture, they nevertheless violate human dignity in both the senses implicit in human rights norms. Seeing how they do so explains why human rights norms do indeed affirm human dignity, and why the affirmation of human dignity demands rights against torture, cruelty, degradation and humiliation at the hands of the state.
