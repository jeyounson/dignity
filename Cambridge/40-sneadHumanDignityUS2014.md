### Human dignity in US law

CARTER SNEAD

A comprehensive analysis of the uses of 'human dignity' in American law would be an extraordinary undertaking. To do so responsibly would require a systematic discussion of a massive array of sources of law. It would also require exploration of a diverse expanse of legal disciplines.

The aspiration of the present chapter is more modest. It aims to offer a brief survey of how 'human dignity' has (and has not) gained purchase in the American legal landscape. To that end, first, the chapter will offer a necessarily cursory reflection on the contested definition of 'human dignity.' Next it will follow a discussion of how human dignity has made its way into American law. This discussion will examine those subject-matter areas that feature human dignity as a legal concept, and will identify possible legal conceptual analogues in the American system (for example, liberty and equality).

#### **Which sense of 'dignity'?**

It is necessary briefly to identify two of the principal competing definitions of 'human dignity' in order to better understand its usage in American law. A useful way to divide the manifold approaches to human dignity is to distinguish those conceptions that treat dignity as a *contingent* human quality from those that regard it as an *intrinsic* attribute of human beings.

The contingent approach to human dignity ascribes it only to those individuals whose actions (or active capacities for certain actions) satisfy a predetermined set of criteria. One species of this approach holds that human dignity is properly attributable to 'a person whose actions, thoughts and concerns are worthy of intrinsic respect because they have been chosen, organized and guided in a way that makes sense from a distinctly individual point of view' (cf. Davis 2008). Thus, human dignity is equated with an activity, namely, the exercise of autonomous choice. Under this dignity-as-autonomy model, certain actions – even certain kinds of lives – are dignified or not (or dignified to greater or lesser degrees) depending on how the individual conducts himself. Dignity is an attribute that ebbs and flows – it can be acquired or lost. Human dignity can be diminished by restraints on autonomous choice wrought by disease, disability or coercion (whether in the form of restrictive laws or private violence). Lives characterized by radical dependence and vulnerability would, according to this view, be undignified. People who lack the cognitive capacity for free choice – young children, the mentally disabled and individuals suffering from dementia – do not possess human dignity in any measure. Conversely, those individuals who have the strength, intelligence and resources to exercise robust free choice possess human dignity in abundance.

By contrast, human dignity has also been conceived as an *intrinsic*, inalienable, absolute property of individuals simply by virtue of their status as human beings. This understanding of dignity holds that all human beings – regardless of their characteristics (such as size, strength, wealth, independence or social standing), actions or circumstances – are equal in dignity and thus entitled to at least a minimal standard of moral respect and care. Here, dignity is understood to be a pre-political quality that is not conferred by others, and cannot be taken away. Under this intrinsic conception of human dignity, the individual is inviolable and entitled to moral concern as well as the protection of the law.

The foregoing is merely a rough sketch of the variable approaches to human dignity, and could surely be refined, deepened and improved. But it is adequate for present purposes as a tool to negotiate the usages of human dignity in American law.

#### **Human dignity in American law**

'Dignity' is a relatively new juridical concept. In American law, the term was first used to denote the proper esteem owed to governmental entities.1 For example, in *Federalist* 55, James Madison notes that the requirements for membership in the federal judiciary are meant to ensure the work of the courts be conducted with 'utility and dignity' (Rao 2008: 239). In the same spirit, in some of its opinions articulating the law of sovereign immunity, the US Supreme Court has asserted: 'Federalism requires that Congress accord States the respect and dignity due them as residuary sovereigns and joint participants that is consistent with their status as sovereign entities.'2

However, outside of the US, largely in response to the Nazi atrocities of the Second World War, 'human dignity' as a juridical concept was introduced and applied in a personal sense, to ground the inviolable worth of all members of the human race. A wide array of nations and intergovernmental bodies integrated human dignity prominently into their legal instruments.

The American legal system did not follow this path of introducing human dignity as a formal concept in its law.3 But human dignity did eventually appear

on the American legal landscape, albeit indirectly. Indeed, appeals to dignity are widespread in American law, though not as a first-order enforceable principle. Human dignity is instead invoked rhetorically to bolster the normative force of other recognized juridical concepts – for example liberty, equality, and due process. In this limited, indirect form, 'human dignity' has been invoked in both its intrinsic and contingent iterations.

#### **Intrinsic human dignity in American law**

Since the 1940s, every branch of American government has invoked 'human dignity' as a personal concept expressing the esteem owed to all human beings. The term has been introduced in multiple fields of law, including criminal law, civil rights law, disability and elder law, and, more recently, in public bioethics.

#### Criminal law and procedure

Substantive and procedural criminal law is replete with references to intrinsic human dignity as a personal concept. This is particularly true in the law governing the investigative process and criminal punishment.

Justices of the US Supreme Court have invoked 'human dignity' to add rhetorical force to their arguments regarding constitutional limits on the authority to investigate crime. The Fourth Amendment to the US Constitution (which forbids 'unreasonable' searches and seizures) is meant to safeguard the privacy interests of individual citizens, while allowing the government to investigate crime. 'Privacy' is thus a juridical principle with some direct force. To underscore the importance of privacy, some Justices have made an appeal to human dignity. For example, the US Supreme Court has asserted that '[t]he overriding function of the Fourth Amendment is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State'.4 In this case and others like it, the Court invoked dignity not as a first-order principle, but as part of a rhetorical strategy to underline the importance of another recognized Fourth Amendment value, namely, privacy.

The Fifth Amendment (among other things) protects individuals from being compelled to be a witness against themselves in a criminal trial. The goods underlying this provision are at least twofold, namely, to protect the criminally accused from unfair coercion, and to sustain the character of the US criminal justice system as primarily accusatorial rather than inquisitorial. To shore up support for these established goods, the US Supreme Court has invoked the concept of human dignity. In the iconic decision of *Miranda* v. *Arizona*, wherein the Supreme Court held that suspects subject to custodial interrogation must first be advised of their rights (to remain silent and to counsel), the Court

4 *Schmerber* v. *California*, 384 US 757 (1966). held that 'the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege [against selfincrimination] is the respect a government – state or federal – must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens'.5 Thus, here (as with the Fourth Amendment) human dignity is invoked to bolster a claim on behalf of other well-recognized normative goods, namely, freedom from improper coercion at the hands of law enforcement.

Apart from the investigative phase of the criminal process, human dignity as an intrinsic personal concept has been cited widely (as a secondary principle) in the law governing punishment. The Eighth Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits 'cruel and unusual' punishment. In this context, more than any other, the Supreme Court has invoked the concept of intrinsic human dignity as a crucial animating principle: 'By protecting even those convicted of heinous crimes, the Eighth Amendment reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons.'6 The Court has asserted: '[T]he basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man.'7 Thus, the Supreme Court has held that the death penalty may not be imposed on those defendants who are categorically incapable of the moral culpability warranting the ultimate punishment (for example, mentally disabled defendants8 and defendants who were under the age of eighteen at the time of the capital offense9 ). Also, the Supreme Court has held that holding prisoners in degrading and inhumane conditions can constitute 'cruel and unusual' punishment.10 *En route* to these conclusions, the Court repeatedly appealed to the intrinsic human dignity of all people – including convicted felons. In each case, intrinsic human dignity was deployed as a normative good to anchor the Court's analysis, though it did not constitute the applicable legal standard itself.

Aside from the jurisprudence of the US Supreme Court, intrinsic 'human dignity' has been invoked in the criminal context by the US Congress. The federal statute establishing certain rights for victims of federal crimes provides that: 'A crime victim has . . . [t]he right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy.'11

#### Civil rights/anti-discrimination law

Intrinsic 'human dignity' has been invoked as a normative grounding for laws against discrimination based on race, sex and disability. Here, human dignity is not itself the legal standard, but rather offers a grounding for the juridical principle of*equality*. In many instances, courts and other governmental officials have asserted that discrimination violates intrinsic dignity by failing to respect

<sup>6</sup> *Roper* v. *Simmons*, 534 US 551, 560 (2005). 7 *Trop* v. *Dulles*, 356 US 86, 100 (1958).

the fundamental equality possessed by all people by virtue of *who they are* as members of the human family. Dissenting from the notorious Supreme Court decision in *Korematsu* v. *US* (which upheld President Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans into 'relocation camps' during the Second World War), Justice Murphy condemned the majority opinion as 'adopt[ing] one of the cruelest of the rationales used by our enemies to destroy the dignity of the individual'.12 Similarly, in an iconic decision of the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of the public accommodations provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Court cited approvingly the purposes of the law: 'The primary purpose of [the Civil Rights Act] . . . is to solve . . . the deprivation of personal dignity that surely accompanies denial of equal access to public establishments.'13 The Court has also argued that discrimination on the basis of sex 'deprives persons of their individual dignity'.14

More recently, the Supreme Court has employed the language of 'human dignity' to denote the respect owed to all people – including those adults who choose to engage in intimate sexual relations with members of the same sex. The Court held that a state law criminalizing 'homosexual conduct' violated liberty interests protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.15 The first-order juridical principle affirmed by this decision was liberty or autonomy. But, in advancing the case for liberty, the Court appealed to the equal dignity of all persons.16

Relatedly, the US Congress has adopted the language of intrinsic 'human dignity' in the legislation aimed at ensuring the equality of the disabled and the elderly. For example, one section of the US Code ('Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights') directs that 'services, supports, and other assistance [offered pursuant to this law] should be provided in a manner that demonstrates respect for individual dignity'.17 Also, in the Special Olympics Sport and Empowerment Act of 2004, Congress recognized the 'dignity and value the giftedness of children and adults with an intellectual disability'.18 Similarly, in the Housing and Recovery Act of 2008, Congress declared that one purpose of the law was to 'enable elderly persons to live with dignity and independence by expanding the supply of supportive housing'.19

name of ethical goods. A few examples will suffice for purposes of illustration. Those public officials who regard the use and destruction of living human beings at the embryonic stage of development as a grave injustice frequently invoke human dignity. In vetoing a congressional effort to liberalize his stem cell research funding policy (which authorized funding only for those forms of stem cell research that did not create material incentives for future destruction of living human embryos20), President Bush cautioned against 'temptations to manipulate human life and violate human dignity'.21 In opposing embryonic stem cell research, Congresswoman Virginia Foxx invoked human dignity even more explicitly:

Those embryos are human beings and should not be treated as research subjects. We would never kill to harvest body parts because of the principle of human dignity. We do not even do this with our most heinous criminals. We do not treat them as things. We treat them with dignity until the time that they die . . . All human beings have profound human dignity.22

In the Executive Order directing the National Institutes of Health to pursue research involving alternative (i.e. non-embryonic) sources of pluripotent cells, President Bush declared that 'it is critical to establish moral and ethical boundaries to allow the Nation to move forward with medical research, while also maintaining the highest ethical standards and respecting human life and human dignity'.23

In the related context of abortion, those public officials who advocate legal protection for the unborn routinely use the language of human dignity. The Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003 banned a particular method of abortion involving the partial delivery of a living foetus prior to piercing or crushing its skull.24 In describing the purpose of the statute, the US Supreme Court noted that 'the Act expresses respect for the dignity of human life'. In support of the new law, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen declared that 'this is a barbaric act that is a grave attack against human dignity and justice'.25

Finally, in the context of global health, President Bush specifically invoked intrinsic human dignity as the grounding good for his policies to address disease in the developing world. For example, President Bush defended his Malaria

Initiative (PMI) as grounded in the truth that 'every human life has inherent dignity and matchless value'.26

#### **Contingent human dignity in American law**

To a lesser extent, some American public officials (particularly jurists) have variously invoked 'human dignity' in its contingent sense. Such officials have embraced the dignity-as-autonomy conception noted above. This usage of human dignity is most evident in the context of American public bioethics. Specifically, contingent human dignity has been invoked in connection with the laws touching and concerning abortion and end-of-life decision-making.

In defending the constitutionally protected liberty interest in abortion (pursuant to the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment), some jurists have suggested that the dignity of women depends on their capacity to freely choose to terminate a pregnancy without interference from the state.27

The US Supreme Court has recognized a protected liberty interest in declining unwanted medical treatment (including life-sustaining measures). No constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide exists, though a few states have legalized it. Defenders of a robust right to terminate life-sustaining measures, and even the right to physician-assisted suicide, invoke the notion of 'death with dignity'. On this view, autonomy makes dignity possible. That is, a life characterized by agonizing pain or radical dependence on others is, in an important sense *un*dignified – an unworthy state of affairs that individuals should have the right to choose against. Choosing to die in the face of the threat of radical dependency and cognitive decline is dignified in two senses: first, it involves the exercise of free choice in the most intimate and existential context, and, second, it evades (or ends) a life bereft of human dignity. This contingent view of dignity is expressed by Justice O'Connor in her concurrence in *Washington* v. *Glucksberg*:

This freedom embraces not merely a person's right to refuse a particular kind of unwanted treatment, but also her interest in dignity, and in determining the character of the memories that will survive after her death . . . Avoiding intolerable pain and the indignity of living one's final days incapacitated and in agony is certainly 'at the heart of [the] liberty . . . to define one's own concept of existence, of meaning, of the universe, and of the mystery of human life'.28

In both the beginning- and end-of-life contexts discussed above, contingent human dignity is invoked as a normative principle amplifying the moral force of a first-order juridical principle, namely, the liberty to make choices in intimate matters. But, unlike the above-discussed examples of intrinsic dignity (where

<sup>26</sup> George W. Bush, 'Malaria Awareness Day, 2008', Proclamation No. 8246, 73 Fed. Reg. 23063 (25 April 2008).

<sup>27</sup> *Planned Parenthood* v. *Casey*, 505 US 833 (1992); *Gonzales* v. *Carhart*, 550 US124 (2007).

human dignity was the grounding and justification for liberty, equality and privacy), here human dignity *depends on* and is *defined by* the exercise of autonomy. A woman's dignity depends on her freedom to choose abortion. A patient's dignity depends on his freedom to decide against a life marked by radical dependency on others. The incapacity to freely choose in these circumstances (because of coercive laws or debilitating disease) destroys the possibility of human dignity.

#### **Conclusion**

The foregoing discussion has briefly explored the various constructions of 'human dignity' in American law. It is a term that is used both to denote an intrinsic characteristic entitling all human beings to at least a bare minimum of respect and protection, and, alternatively, a contingent quality that is premised on the capacity to exercise autonomous choice. As a legal concept, it has had a limited direct impact. It has not, for example, been recognized by the Supreme Court as a constitutionally protected interest to the degree that liberty, equality, or even privacy have. It has not been enshrined in positive law as a doctrinal principle directly applicable to regulate conduct. It is, however, often invoked by courts and officials in the political branches alike to amplify the moral claims made pursuant to more commonly recognized principles of American law, such as equality, liberty, privacy and justice.
