#### **The Cambridge Handbook of Human Dignity**

This introduction to human dignity explores the history of the notion from antiquity to the nineteenth century, and the way in which dignity is conceptualized in non-Western contexts. Building on this, it addresses a range of systematic conceptualizations, considers the theoretical and legal conditions for human dignity as a useful notion and analyzes a number of philosophical and conceptual approaches to dignity. Finally, the book introduces current debates, paying particular attention to legal implementation, human rights, justice and conflicts, medicine and bioethics, and provides an explicit systematic framework for discussing human dignity. Adopting a wide range of perspectives and taking into account numerous cultures and contexts, this handbook is a valuable resource for students, scholars and professionals working in philosophy, law, history and theology.

### Foreword

Professor Alain Plantey, the well-known French jurist, who represented the French Academy of Moral and Political Sciences in the International Union of Academies (IUA), proposed a project for joint research by the memberacademies on the subject of human rights. After long discussion, the Bureau of the IUA modified the subject-matter of the investigation by converting it to a project to investigate human dignity, so as to give the opportunity to non-European academies to participate. The General Assembly of the IUA accepted the project in this form.

The project is unique amongst the projects patronized by the IUA for several reasons. The investigation is not being carried out by two or more interested academies according to a previously fixed timetable, but rather is open to all member academies. At the start of the project, with the financial aid of the European Science Foundation (ESF), three meetings of experts were organized by the Bureau of the IUA in cooperation with three member academies, as follows:

- - 'Human Dignity: Religious and Historical Aspects', Jerusalem, 17–18 December 2006, organized by G. Stroumsa
- - 'Human Dignity: Sociological, Ethical and Bioethical Perspectives', Rabat, 26–27 June 2007, organized by M. Duwell, G. Stroumsa and I. Khalil ¨
- - 'Human Dignity: Juridical and Philosophical Perspectives', Barcelona, 16–17 July 2007, organized by S. Giner, G. Stroumsa and M. Duwell. ¨

A closing session was held on 1–4 October 2007 in Vadstena (Sweden), where, based on the experience gained during the previous sessions, the necessary conclusions were drawn by the participants. The organizers were M. Duwell ¨ and G. Stroumsa.

As a result of these preparatory meetings, the General Assembly of the IUA approved guidelines for further research, according to which the most important first step was to collect a volume of studies which would sum up the outcome of the conferences held so far, on the one hand, and, by delineating the problem in general, could serve as starting-point for future work, on the other.

The General Assembly entrusted the Norwegian Academy of Sciences with the organization and supervision of future activities in this field, and with the composition of the present volume.

The IUA hopes that this volume will prompt further research in order to enrich the outcome of these investigations, and will also prompt politicians to implement the results achieved by scholars.
