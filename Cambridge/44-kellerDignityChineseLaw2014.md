### The protection of human dignity under Chinese law

PERRY KELLER

While the protection of human dignity figures prominently in the laws of the People's Republic of China, it is no simple task to reconcile contemporary liberal democratic discourse regarding human dignity with the exercise of power through law in China. Since its establishment in 1949, the government of China has determinedly rejected liberal democratic models of the state, including the constitutionalization of fundamental rights (Loughlin 2010: 47). China's rise towards the heights of global economic and political power has moreover strengthened the confidence of Chinese Communist Party ('the Party') leaders in their domestic model. Eschewing meaningful legal restraints on the powers of government, the Party has maintained a system of political and administrative intervention in legal outcomes (Clarke 2011).

Compared to the violent persecutions of the recent past, most notably including the Cultural Revolution unleashed in1966 by Mao Zedong, personal freedom and security are undoubtedly much improved in China today (MacFarquhar and Schoenhals 2006). Nonetheless, the Chinese Party-state's often unrestricted use of power continues to raise vital questions about the exercise of state power and the protection of human dignity under Chinese law.1 Yet those concerns should not obscure the ways in which questions of human dignity are also at the forefront of current efforts to improve legal protections and remedies addressing harm to the integrity of the body and the mind. While these largely concern the prevention and redress of harmful acts of the state, they also include a widening sphere of private acts in China's fast-changing market economy. New communications technologies and services have, for example, transformed Chinese society and brought demands for more effective legal remedies for injuries to reputation and intrusions into privacy (for example, Yang *et al*. 2011; Wang *et al*. 2010: 45).

#### **Human dignity and constitutionalized rights**

Specific concerns regarding the recognition and protection of human dignity in Chinese law are situated within the broader question of whether and to what extent China will become a constitutionalized, human-rights-based state (for example, Balme and Dowdle 2009). Indeed, this question has provided the main conceptual framework for Western analysis and support for Chinese legal development since the current reform period began in 1978. More than three decades later, the Chinese legal system has acquired all the formal components necessary for the creation of a constitutionalized state. And yet, despite that panoply of legislation, it does not aspire to the protection of human dignity in ways expected under the dominant international model of independent judicial authority over fundamental rights.

The present Constitution, adopted in 1982, uses the term 'dignity' in several different contexts.2 These include the dignity of the Constitution itself, the dignity of the socialist legal system and the personal dignity of Chinese citizens.3 The Constitution also contains significant declarations regarding civil and political as well as economic and social rights, which ostensibly secure the liberty of citizens from the state although counterweighted by broadly phrased limitations and duties.4 The Chinese legal system, however, contains no direct mechanism to apply these constitutional liberties and protections in legal or administrative practice. Indeed, that essential element of constitutionalism is incompatible with the basic design of the Chinese state, which is a creation of the Party and in all aspects, including its structure, organization and work, remains subject to Party authority (McGregor 2010). While the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's national legislature, is empowered to interpret and supervise the enforcement of its provisions, it rarely uses these powers to create constitutional doctrine.5 The Supreme People's Court moreover has neither the legal nor political authority to apply constitutional principles or rights to resolve legal claims and disputes (Kellogg 2009a: 215). Chinese constitutional law is therefore largely dormant.

In the past decade, the Supreme People's Court has tentatively breached and then reaffirmed those barriers to judicial constitutional review. In 2001, the Court famously intervened in a case that raised a point of constitutional law and a complex human dignity question involving the fundamental right of citizens to education (Kellogg 2009b). In this case, a student stole the college examination results of a fellow student and then falsely using her identity gained a college degree and subsequent employment at a bank. On discovering the deceit some years later, the defrauded student, named Qi Yuling, brought a

- 3 Constitution, Preamble, Arts. 5 and 38.

civil case in which she claimed damages not only for theft of identity but also for infringement of her constitutional right to an education.6 In determining how to decide this novel claim, the provincial court sought advice from the Supreme People's Court, which directed that the defendants should pay compensation for infringing Qi's constitutional right to an education through theft of her identity.

Viewed from within Western constitutional experience, the Qi Yuling case was an unusual choice for a ground-breaking direct judicial application of the Constitution. The Supreme People's Court applied the Constitution to an instance of private interference with access to a state-supported educational resource, which in terms of human dignity is at the more contentious end of its potential application to constitutionalized rights. In a Chinese context, however, these features gave the case obvious advantages. It involved neither an alleged unconstitutional act by the state nor a restriction on a politically sensitive right, such as freedom of speech. Yet any foray into judicial constitutional review, however seemingly innocuous, is contrary to the fundamental rules of the contemporary Chinese legal and political order (Tong 2010: 669). Direct application of the Constitution opens the way to doctrinal fetters on the powers and acts of the state and with that the Party's ultimate power to determine governmental policy and to guide state administration. After allowing the case to languish without mention for several years, the Supreme People's Court quietly withdrew the Qi Yuling Reply in 2008, noting only that it was no longer applicable.

Official opposition to constitutionalism in China has not entirely blocked its development. The Party's legal reform programme, which has brought greater professionalization of judges and extensive reforms to procedural and substantive law, has created the foundations for rule-of-law-based challenges to the exercise of state power (Fu and Cullen 2008: 11; Lin 2010: 305). In a wide variety of cases, public interest lawyers, and to a lesser extent local judges, have attempted to develop constitutionalism interstitially, rhetorically invoking if not directly applying constitutional rights. These cases involve criminal defendants, environmental victims, villagers dispossessed of their land and homes and other claimants of grave and unjustifiable injury to physical and mental integrity (Fu and Cullen 2008).

Nonetheless, China's entire legal system, including the procuratorates, courts and legal profession, are thoroughly enmeshed in Party as well as state hierarchies (Liebman 2007: 620). Judges, like all other government officials, must work within Party and state policy guidelines, administrative targets and personal accountability systems (Zhu 2010b: 63). While most lawyers are not state employees, their rights to practise are nonetheless subject to annual good conduct reviews by Party-state authorities (Fu and Cullen 2008). Chinese national and local authorities consequently have ample means to discipline judges,

lawyers or other individuals who attempt to develop legal rights or practice beyond current permitted boundaries, even at the cost of a more effective legal system (Minzner 2011: 935).

#### **Human dignity and legislative reforms**

While China's government has acted firmly to contain public interest lawyering (Fu 2011), legislative provisions that generally or specifically protect human dignity are a notable feature of Chinese law. These laws typically concern the protection of vulnerable classes of individuals from violations of mental or physical integrity.7 The national Mental Health Law, for example, stipulates that the human dignity of persons with mental disorders shall not be violated.8 In recent years, legal changes have also strengthened procedural and substantive protections for individuals suspected or accused of criminal offences. These include various changes to procedural and evidentiary rules regarding confessions obtained by torture as well as amendments to the criminal law eliminating some offences from those carrying a potential death penalty.9

Despite reforms of this nature, the effective protection of the individual from arbitrary or otherwise unjustified coercive acts of state authorities, including gross violation of criminal procedure laws, remains a widespread problem in China (McConville 2011). In the field of administrative rather than criminal detention, the Party's determination to retain flexibility has often outweighed arguments for the better protection of the individual. In 2003, a media and public outcry following the violent death of Sun Zhigang, a young university graduate, in administrative custody, brought about a significant change in police powers to detain vagrants (cf. Hand 2006: 117).10 While these changes in the law may have eased the problem of arbitrary and excessive detention in one aspect of policing, the Communist Party's Central Political-Legal Committee and the national Ministry of Public Security have so far refused to allow the abolition or wholesale reform of the critically important *Laodong Jiaoyang* system (Yu and Mosher 2010: 66). Under this form of administrative detention, known as

Re-Education Through Labour (RTL), local public security committees may sentence individuals to detention with forced labour for a period of up to four years.11 Similarly, the Party continues to employ its own coercive procedures in which Party Discipline Inspection authorities may hold in custody and interrogate Party members suspected of wrongdoing (Sapio 2008: 7).

The concept of human dignity as a personal or civil right, as expressed in the Constitution, has however provided an important if controversial stimulus for the development of private law rights. In 2002, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress issued a draft civil code, setting out a framework for existing and planned legislation (Zhang 2009: 1000). This draft was extolled for its distinctive introduction of a separate chapter on human dignity, encompassing rights to life, body and health as well as name, image, reputation and privacy. With the 2007 Property Rights Law and the 2009 Tort Liability Law safely adopted, work is currently underway on a projected national law on human dignity to fulfil this element of the 2002 draft code.12

#### **Human dignity and the paternalistic state**

In one dimension of human dignity, the state's responsibility to ensure the basic economic and social well-being of its citizens, China has become a global model. Since the Cultural Revolution, the Party has created the conditions for an unprecedented rise in household and personal well-being. Yet, as the Chinese government recognizes, greater efforts are needed to tackle the country's increasing differences in personal income and wealth. That, however, will require reforms to the national household registration (*hukou*) system which exacerbates growing inequalities in access to education, employment and pensions as well as medical and other key services. Under the *hukou* system, every Chinese citizen is registered as resident in a particular place, resulting in an urban–rural status division running throughout Chinese society (Wu and Treiman 2007: 415).13 In general, if a person's *hukou* is registered in a major city, he or she will enjoy much better life chances as compared to rural-registered individuals, including those who have temporary permission to reside and work in that city as 'migrant workers' (Kam and Buckingham 2008:582). The children of these migrant workers are frequently barred from the better quality urban state schools for lack of the proper *hukou* (Branigan 2010).14 This occurs despite national laws that create a duty on state authorities to provide nine years of

compulsory education for all children.15 Chinese policy-makers have debated radical reform of the *hukou* system for years, but fears of unleashing a flood of internal migration have meant that most rural poor do not qualify under schemes permitting change of *hukou*.

In other areas, such as the equality of women, the Party, once at the forefront of women's emancipation in China, has responded slowly to the inequalities and risks faced by women in a fast-changing, market-based society (Diamant 2000: 171).16 Pressure from Party-affiliated women's organizations, including the paramount All China Women's Federation, has certainly helped to bring legislative change in areas such as domestic violence and sexual harassment.17 The difficulty, characteristic of the Chinese legal system generally, has been to transform the general provisions of national law governing these issues into defined rights and duties underpinned by standards of liability and compensation that local public authorities are able and willing to enforce (Liu 2011: 6).

#### **Conclusion**

China undoubtedly has a blemished record for the protection of the physical and mental integrity of its citizens from arbitrary and excessive acts committed by state authorities. National laws that purportedly protect individuals from such harm often lack the legal specificity and the institutional capabilities necessary for enforcement, leaving state authorities free to violate the moral status of citizens without the basic justifications required by any conception of human dignity. On the other hand, improvement of this situation is a matter of debate within China in spheres that include advisory bodies within the Party as well as intellectual circles critical of the Party's abuses of power.

In these debates, perhaps the most important question is whether China can develop an alternative to the constitutionalized liberal democratic model that provides effective remedies for such abuses. That alternative, if successful, may well emerge out of China's long history of citizen–state relationships, grounded in the Confucian tradition, in which elites advance moral principles through the institutions that guide state behaviour (Balme and Yang 2007: 445). Here, for example, the basic Confucian obligation of those in positions of authority to act consistently with the concept of *Ren* (meaning benevolence or goodness) has obvious potential in relation to the achievement of higher standards of human dignity. Plainly, the Chinese government has embraced the concept of

fundamental human rights, and these now play an important role in public debate in China.18 This new expectation that the realization of fundamental rights is a key measure of the legitimacy of Chinese government may, however, be satisfied primarily through political rather than legal institutions. If that were to occur, the Chinese model would prove itself to be not simply a wilful distortion of Western models for the protection of human dignity, but instead the fruit of conscious, long-running efforts to create a viable alternative to the Western version of modernity.
