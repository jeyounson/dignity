# Human dignity in South African law

ANTON FAGAN

In no legal system does human dignity play a greater role than in the South African one. The South African Constitution accords everyone 'the right to have their dignity respected and protected'.1 It also recognizes human dignity as one of three values (the others are equality and freedom) upon which the Republic of South Africa was founded and which the South African Bill of Rights affirms.2

#### **Dignity as a right and as a value in South African law**

Inconsistency with the *right* to dignity (like inconsistency with any other right in the Bill of Rights) is ground for a court to declare invalid a legal rule, whether it be a statutory, common-law or customary rule.3 Which legal rules are inconsistent with the right to dignity depends upon the scope of its application. That is: it depends upon whom the right binds. According to the Constitution, every one of the rights in its Bill of Rights, and thus also the right to dignity, binds the state.4 The Constitution does not, however, say whether the right also binds private persons. As with all the other rights in the Bill of Rights, the question whether the right to dignity binds private persons is left to the courts to determine, 'taking into account the nature of the right and the nature of any duty imposed by the right'.5 Though this is not entirely clear, the South African Constitutional Court seems to have accepted that the right to dignity does bind private persons.6

The South African courts have declared a number of legal rules invalid on the ground of their inconsistency with the right to dignity. Most of the rules have been statutory, such as a provision in the Criminal Procedure Act permitting the death penalty to be imposed for murder,7 a provision in the same

Act allowing for corporal punishment of juvenile offenders,8 provisions in the Aliens Control Act dealing with applications by foreign spouses of South African citizens for immigration and work permits9 and a provision in the Black Administration Act regulating intestate succession in the case of black South Africans.10 However, inconsistency with the right to dignity has been the ground for declaring invalid at least one common-law rule, namely, the rule criminalizing sodomy.11 And it has been the ground for declaring invalid a rule of African customary law, namely, the rule of male primogeniture as applied to intestate succession.12

As a *value*, human dignity is explicitly given two roles by the South African Constitution. The Constitution requires a court to promote the value of human dignity (along with those of equality and freedom) whenever it interprets the Bill of Rights.13 And it requires a court to consider the value of human dignity (again along with those of equality and freedom) when determining whether the limitation of a right in the Bill of Rights by a legal rule is 'reasonable and justifiable', and thus constitutionally permitted.14

The South African Constitutional Court has frequently employed the value of human dignity in the first of these roles. So, for example, the Court invoked the value of human dignity when interpreting the right not to be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,15 the right to freedom and security of the person,16 the right against unfair discrimination,17 the right to have access to adequate housing,18 the right to privacy,19 the right to have access to social security,20 the right to culture21 and even the right to a fair

trial.22 The value of human dignity has also been employed in the second role, but more rarely. There are two rights whose limitations have been found to be reasonable and justifiable, and thus constitutionally permitted, on the ground that the limitations served the value of human dignity. They are the right to freedom of religion (limited by a statute prohibiting corporal punishment in all schools, including private religious ones) and the right to freedom of expression (limited by a statute criminalizing various acts to do with child pornography and by the common-law rules imposing tortious liability for defamation).23

According to the Constitutional Court, the Constitution by implication gives the value of human dignity four further roles. The basis for these implied roles is the Constitution's express imposition, on the courts, of an obligation to 'promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights', first, when interpreting a statute, second, when developing the common law, and, third, when developing customary law.24 The Constitutional Court has held, reasonably enough, that the obligation to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights when engaged in any one of these three activities, entails an obligation to promote the value of human dignity (as well as the values of freedom and equality).25 Consistent with this, the Court relied upon the value of human dignity to justify its interpreting the word 'spouse' in two statutes to include parties to a Muslim marriage.26 Less reasonably, the Court has held that the second of these obligations, that is, the obligation to promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights *when* developing the common law, entails the further and very different obligation *to develop* the common law whenever it falls short of the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.27 According to the Constitutional Court, therefore, the Constitution accords the value of human dignity a primary, and not merely a secondary, role in the common law's development. The value of human dignity is to serve as an independent ground for developing the common law, alongside the rights in the Bill of Rights, and not merely as a tie-breaker when one or more of those rights already justify

some development of the common law, but are indeterminate as to the precise form which that development should take.28

#### **The concept of dignity in South African law**

Notwithstanding the many occasions on which human dignity has been invoked by the South African courts, South African law has yet to develop a *concept* of human dignity capable of explaining the multiple roles accorded it by the South African Constitution. It is true that the South African Constitutional Court, in a number of judgments over a number of years, has endorsed the following more-or-less Kantian set of propositions about human dignity:

(1) Human dignity is the value inherent in every human being (the value every human being has simply by virtue of being human). (2) This value is infinite and consequently incomparable with other values. (3) This value, since it is both inherent and infinite, is equal for all human beings, regardless of their character or conduct. (4) Human beings, as objects of value, deserve respect. (5) Human beings, as objects of equal value, deserve equal respect. (6) Human dignity, so understood, is the foundation of most (possibly all) of the rights in the Bill of Rights.29

However, the Court's use of this Kantian concept of human dignity to explicate the value of, and right to, dignity in the South African Constitution is not without difficulty. The second proposition above states that human dignity (the value inherent in human beings) is infinite and incomparable. But how could the value of human dignity, so understood, play the second of the roles which the Constitution explicitly accords it, namely, to help determine whether the limitation of a right is reasonable and justifiable? For that, as the Constitutional Court has accepted, may require a court to balance the value of human dignity against (and thus compare it to) the right being limited.30 A similar problem arises with respect to the right to dignity, if it is given a Kantian content along

the lines suggested by the propositions above. Understood as the right to the respect owed to one by virtue of one's inherent, infinite and incomparable value, the right to dignity must be an absolute right. For to accord a person any less respect than that would be to deny his humanity. And nothing could possibly justify that. However, the Constitution does not preclude the possibility that the constitutional right to dignity may be justifiably and reasonably limited. More than that, the Constitutional Court has explicitly held that '[l]ike all constitutional rights, [the right to dignity] is not absolute and may be limited in appropriate cases'.31

There is a further difficulty with the idea that the Kantian concept of human dignity can explain dignity in the South African Constitution. Human dignity, so conceived, certainly is capable of playing the foundational role which the Constitutional Court ascribes to it (in the last of the propositions above). However, it is possible that the contribution of human dignity to the justification of rights, though indispensible, is purely formal. It may be that we have reason to care about others' interests only because they have human dignity. If so, human dignity is essential to the explanation of others' rights against us. It does not follow, however, that human dignity has any role to play in the identification and elucidation of those rights. For it may be that, in order to determine and give content to the rights others have against us, it is enough that we consider their (and our) interests. (There may be doubts that something can have an essential, yet formal, role to play in the justification of a norm. But imagine that, after a mother has instructed her son to obey the babysitter, the babysitter commands him to go and blow his nose. Without the mother's instruction, the babysitter's command would impose no duty. The instruction is thus essential to the existence of the duty. But it has no role to play in the determination of the content of that duty: that depends entirely on what the babysitter has commanded.)

This presents a problem for the Constitutional Court's attempt to cast dignity in the South African Constitution in a Kantian mould. For it would appear to be incompatible with the Constitution's explicit instruction that the value of human dignity is to guide the interpretation of the rights in the Bill of Rights. And it would appear to be incompatible with the Constitutional Court's assumption that the value of human dignity is to guide the interpretation of statutes, as well as the development of common and customary law. If the role of human dignity in the justification of rights is a purely formal, albeit essential, one, human dignity could not possibly discharge these tasks (no more than the
