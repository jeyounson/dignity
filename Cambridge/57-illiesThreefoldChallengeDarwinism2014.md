### The threefold challenge of Darwinism to an ethics of human dignity

CHRISTIAN ILLIES∗

Many (such as Frances P. Cobbe) regard Darwin's *Origin of Species* as the final nail in the coffin of theism, and his *Descent of Man* as sounding the '[death] knell of the virtue of mankind'.1 Yet Darwin insisted that an evolutionary explanation of ourmoral sense in no way harms ethics; but, rather, gives it a surer foundation. The question of whether Darwin's insights can provide this foundation, or whether they are in fact harmful to ethics, is still discussed today. In what follows, I will look at a particular aspect of this debate, namely, the importance of Darwinism for a Kantian style of dignity ethics.

By 'Darwinism' I mean an evolutionary theory where natural selection is the central explanatory concept for the development of natural phenomena (including human beings and their behaviour). I will look at this as a *scientific theory*, not at evolutionary theory as an overall worldview. Some authors, such as Daniel Dennett, have tried to push evolutionary theory in this direction (as a worldview), and argued on its basis for a naturalistic metaphysics which would obviously not be compatible with dignity ethics (Dennett 1996). I will concentrate on the implications of the scientific theory alone.

I understand 'human dignity' in the Kantian tradition as a special normative status, based upon the claim that *all* human beings are rational and free (or at least have the potential to be free), where this actual or potential autonomy is the basis of universal human dignity. Kantian dignity ethics is a type of moral cognitivism; it is based upon the assumption that it is a rational claim to attribute dignity universally to all humans.

As I will argue, there are three versions of the evolution-theory challenge to a Kantian kind of dignity ethics, but dignity ethics can withstand them all. However, it might have to be substantially modified in light of evolutionary theory.

#### **Animals can be like humans**

A typical member of the species *homo sapiens* has some characteristics that make him excel amongst all other animals, namely, reason and autonomy. In most versions of dignity ethics, these abilities justify the claim that human beings, and human beings alone, have a special status. 'Morality, and humanity as capable of it, is that which alone has dignity', Kant writes (1889: 53).

A typical transcendental justification for this claim goes as follows. Moral norms or values only become real if there are rational, autonomous beings to realize them in actions. Hence morality depends on autonomous agents as its *raison d'ˆetre*. Without autonomous agents, there cannot be any morality. Therefore, the first transcendentally derived moral demand is to defend the freedom and rationality of free rational agents because a moral scheme which does *not* do so would undermine its own basis and thus be self-contradictory. It follows that, if dignity is based on autonomy and reason (or at least the potential for it), then only free rational beings have dignity. Because animals lack these cognitive abilities, it is argued, they do not belong to this privileged class. As Kant says in his *Lecture on Ethics*: 'So far as animals are concerned, we have no direct duties. Animals . . . are there merely as means to an end. That end is man' (Kant 1963: 239).

The evolutionary perspective undermines the notion of any such privileged status for human beings because it presents an evolutionary continuum between human and non-human animals (see for example Bugynar, Stowe and Bernd ¨ 2004; Sommer 2011). The mental skills of humans might be not entirely different from the skills of non-human animals. Does it follow that dignity ethics collapses because 'any adequate defence of human dignity would require some conception of human beings as radically different from other animals' (Rachels1990:171–2)? No, there is no cogent reason why this should be. Dignity is accorded to agents who are rational and free – that is why Kant talks not so much about 'human beings' but about the respect we owe to *all rational beings*. If some animals are freer and more rational than we have hitherto thought, then they also have dignity. Yet all criteria for human dignity – rationality, freedom, autonomy etc. – are still in place.2 Dignity ethics claims that human beings have a *unique status*, but it does not have to claim that humans are *unique in having such a status*.

#### **Humans can be like animals**

Let us look at things the other way round. Perhaps human beings are *not* free agents who can act morally, but are rather much more like animals and thus do not deserve to be treated differently to all other animals.

<sup>2</sup> To be sure, there is the problem of how to justify the attribution of dignity in the case of marginal human agents who seem to lack full autonomy and freedom – but this problem is independent from the status of animals.

#### Determined by our genes?

Are we determined by our biological nature? Although often accused of determinism by critics, evolutionary theory in fact rarely makes deterministic claims.3 Scientists even talk about 'freedom' when it comes to human actions and decisions (Dawkins 1976) and deny that any biologist believes in 'genetic determinism' (Wilson 1998: 205). Evolutionary biology does not identify precise instincts or strict patterns of human behaviour, but rather probabilities or statistical laws describing behaviour.

Why Darwinism cannot say much more about human behaviour becomes obvious when we look at the structure of its explanations of moral behaviour. According to evolutionary theory, human beings are born with certain genetic dispositions to feel, judge or act in certain ways which are morally relevant. These dispositions can be called 'primary phenotypic adaptations'. But human beings also seem to have innate dispositions which allow them to regulate themselves by responses (for example, blame) and to set up entire ethical systems. We can call these systems 'secondary phenotypic behaviour', because they are a level over and above the primary (Rauscher 1997). On this second (cultural) level, the behavioural dispositions are coordinated and stabilized by mechanisms of social affirmation – religious commands, for example, or civil laws (Wilson 1978: 167). Secondary phenotypic behaviour seems to have its own (cultural) history and its own mechanisms of development (cultural inheritance is probably Lamarckian rather than Darwinian), but it is not entirely independent of primary phenotypic behaviour. Normative principles make normative assessments of the interactive behavioural dispositions with which our genes provide us (for example, jealousy, cooperation, mating preferences, even attitudes towards infanticide).

Consequently, what an actual agent does will always be shaped on both primary and secondary phenotypic levels, and it is the secondary one that explains why an evolutionary account of human behaviour is on the whole probabilistic rather than deterministic: genes are just one among many different types of causes that must be considered; and it is by no means clear whether we will ever be able to identify a sufficient set of causes (genetic and cultural) which fully determines human behaviour. Of course, *cultural determinism* remains a possibility, but it is certainly not a thesis for which evolutionary theory is likely to provide strong arguments or evidence.

#### Are human beings driven by selfishness?

Evolutionary Theory explains human behaviour in a way that might invite yet another objection. Are we programmed to be psychological egoists (and thus

<sup>3</sup> Some biologists do argue deterministically, for example William Provine, and most prominently Charles Darwin who wrote in 1838: '[O]ne doubts existence of free will every action determined by hereditary constitution, example of others or teaching of others' (Darwin 1838).

not worth being respected as moral agents)? After all, natural selection favours winners, who care primarily about their own genes and their proliferation. As products of a long evolutionary history, we should have been selected as egoists whose 'ultimate goal' (Steven Pinker's term) is evolutionary success.4 According to this account, we are never truly moral, at least not if morality is about acting out of some genuine (self-less) concern for others, or about doing the right thing *for its own sake*.

What exactly does it mean to say that natural selection favours selfishness? First, the theory claims that genes are the unit of selection (as sociobiology has powerfully argued). The prevalent genes in a population (including the genepool of *Homo sapiens*) should be those that have the phenotypic effects most favourable to their own replication. Second, evolutionary theory argues that natural selection works on behaviour. Evolutionary psychology gives details to this by claiming that our brain consists of specialized (often unconsciously operating) neural circuits ('modules') which have been selected to solve problems our hunter-gatherer ancestors faced. If we combine the two claims we have an account of the human being as a creature guided by its genes to act in ways which are in its evolutionary interest.

There is, however, no direct path from successful ('selfish') genes to selfish behaviour. Moreover, to act selfishly (i.e. with egoistic motives) is often not the best way to promote one's evolutionary success. And that is why our genes give us rather different motives, like hunger, curiosity, cooperative interests, and rivalry. Darwin distinguishes between the 'standard' and the 'motive' of conduct, the former being related to the outcome of the action or the good that it promotes (such as reproductive success), the latter to the subjective motives of the agent (Darwin 1817: 120).5 Thus, even if the genes direct our behaviour in the interest of our genes, they have not programmed us as psychological egoists on the phenotypic level.

But then, if genes affect us in such a way that we are not conscious of their effect (or 'standard'), do they then make us have *hidden* selfish motives? Richard Alexander, for example, argues that natural selection has shaped us to be unaware of our impulses, because this self-ignorance allows us to deceive others more efficiently (Alexander 1975: 96). This is implausible for two reasons. On the one hand, it is not clear what this unconscious motive might be. There seems to be nothing suppressed or waiting to be discovered here. No psychoanalyst will ever help us discover that we only *thought* that we were hungry, but that, in fact, this was really an unconscious selfish desire to proliferate. Such a 'hidden selfish motive' cannot be discovered in any obvious way; neither can its existence

<sup>5</sup> In his critique of Sidgwick's Utilitarianism, he writes: 'With respect to the latter theory, the standard and the motive of conduct have no doubt often been confused, but they are really in some degree blended.'

be proved or disproved. If it is in the interest of our genes to behave in some situations altruistically (to feel love and sympathy towards our siblings, for example), then our genes have probably programmed us to have these motives or feelings. But what point would there be in postulating a second, *deeper*, selfish motive behind it? The idea of an unconscious psychological egoism is based upon confusion, as Stephen Pinker suspects: 'The confusion comes from thinking of people's genes as their *true self*, and the motives of their *genes* as their deepest, truest, unconscious, motives. From there it is easy to draw the cynical and incorrect moral that all love is hypocritical' (Pinker 1999: 401).

#### **Debunking practical reason**

A third challenge of evolutionary theory is to be found on the meta-ethical level. Richard Joyce and others argue that evolutionary explanations for moral beliefs debunk the meta-ethical tenet that morality is something real and that human beings have moral knowledge (Singer 1982, Joyce 2006). Following Erik Wielenberg, we can formulate the 'Evolutionary Debunking Thesis' (EDT):6

If S's moral belief D can be given an evolutionary explanation, then S's moral belief D is not knowledge. (Wielenberg 2010)

Exponents of the EDT do not deny that we *regard* some of our moral beliefs as universally valid. But it is exactly this objectivist viewpoint which, they argue, is an *illusion* with respect to the nature of moral judgments, an illusion our genes provide for us, in order that we might be successful cooperators (Ruse and Wilson 1985). Dignity ethics should take EDT seriously; after all, dignity ethics claims to provide some moral knowledge.

Let us look at an example of an *evolutionary* explanation of the belief that all human beings have dignity (or at least some special normative status). It is argued first that every human being believes that *he or she* has this status. The belief has been positively selected because it enhances genetic fitness: if S sees herself as more than merely a thing amongst other things (more than an entity that others may use *ad lib*), then S is motivated to prevent others from doing harm to her. Such behaviour will increase her chances of survival and reproduction (Joyce 2006: 111) and that would explain S's belief D *of S* (everyone thinks *he* or *she* has a special normative status).

Why should D be expanded to others? Here, Wielenberg suggests a 'Likeness Principle' at work: 'Consider the principle that things that are alike with respect to their known properties are alike with respect to their unknown properties (call this *Likeness Principle*). Recognizing this principle, or being disposed to reason in accordance with it, provides many advantages' (Wielenberg 2010: 445). Wielenberg argues that it is in general an advantage to treat like cases alike. We

<sup>6</sup> I have changed P into D in Wielenberg's formulation because I am investigating the belief that humans have dignity.

must therefore think that special normative status should be given to *anyone like us*: S's belief D becomes a general belief about everyone having D.7

If an evolutionary explanation on these lines is correct, would it debunk any belief in human dignity? The immediate answer seems to be 'no': it is certainly possible that S's moral belief D finds an evolutionary explanation *and* that the belief D is also correct. The functionality of our moral beliefs and their correctness could coincide, and EDT would be wrong. This is, after all, the situation with some theoretical beliefs. Evolution has shaped us so that we tend to believe some facts about the world; for example, that events are causally connected ('belief C') and that the world really is ordered in terms of cause and effect (C is in fact true). It is plausible to assume C because it is functionally advantageous (fitness-enhancing) to have veridical representations of the world, i.e. to believe that the world is ordered in the way in which it actually is.8

We cannot rebut EDT so easily, however. Even if the truth of D is logically compatible with an evolutionary explanation of our belief D, we find D much 'harder to buy' once we know the 'biological machinery behind this illusion' (Wright 1994:339). Here is a difference between theoretical and practical beliefs. In the case of theoretical beliefs, we have a situation wherein C (the way the world really is) is a *part of the explanation* for the selective advantage of the belief C. Someone who tends to look for causes will understand better how things work and will deal more successfully with the world. But in the case of moral beliefs there is no such explanatory connection: erroneous beliefs about moral facts (if there are any moral facts) do not seem to decrease our fitness in an obvious way. Someone who does not believe in the dignity of others is not 'punished' by the realities of our world like the man who ignores causality.

Consider this interesting thought-experiment by Darwin. In his response to the objection by Frances Cobbe, quoted above, he writes that our moral beliefs have been selected *only* because they increased our fitness, *not* because they are true:

If, for instance, to take an extreme case, men were reared under precisely the same conditions as hive-bees, there can hardly be a doubt that our unmarried females would, like the worker-bees, think it a sacred duty to kill their brothers, and mothers would strive to kill their fertile daughters; and no one would think of interfering. (Darwin 1817: 99)

- 7 Wielenberg leaves it open whether it increases directly our fitness to think that everyone has *d*. It might merely be an indirect effect of an otherwise advantageous principle that we generally apply.
- 8 Evolutionary theory does not have to hold that it is different with theoretical beliefs; they could also be false. R. Trivers argues in this sense that 'the conventional view that natural selection favours nervous systems which produce ever more accurate images of the world must be a very naive view of natural selection' (Dawkins 1976: vi). A similar doubt about the trustworthiness of our beliefs has already been raised by Charles Darwin in a letter to William Graham dated 3 July 1881 (Darwin 1887: 315–16).

We seem, then, to have no reason to assume that our moral beliefs are in accordance with moral facts.9 If they were, it would be a 'striking coincidence between the independent normative truths posited by the realist and the normative views that evolutionary forces pushed us toward', as Sharon Street writes (Street 2008).

The first observation is that the coincidence is not as striking as Street suggests. After all, we have many innate beliefs and many of them do *not* coincide with the truths posited by the realist. If evolutionary theory is right, then we have innate xenophobic beliefs, or beliefs that stepchildren have less importance than biological children. There are a lot of predispositions which incline us to believe A, B, C, D, etc. and only very few of these beliefs coincide with the alleged moral truths promoted by dignity ethics. We are, after all, an ambivalent mixture of good and bad impulses pulling us in different directions, as we all know only too well. (But worse: some moral demands find no easy resonance in us; these are examples of moral truths which do not coincide with innate beliefs.) Thus, the coincidence is much smaller than Street thinks: it is merely that D is amongst the *various* beliefs (good and bad) that we might hold 'naturally'.

Second, it is not so 'striking' to find a 'coincidence' between some moral truths and some innate beliefs. After all, morality is about human well-being and so is much of what is functional in evolutionary terms. In most cases, human well-being is a necessary condition for reproductive success. Moral truths and innate beliefs do not, however, coincide completely. Whereas morality demands support of the universal well-being of the species (or wider), the focus of evolutionary-functional beliefs is the individual and its siblings or offspring. A certain coincidence is therefore to be expected rather than to be found surprising.

Finally, the moral fact D and my belief D might not be entirely disconnected. The human belief D is (just as much as our other moral beliefs) both the starting point and part of the explanation and justification of D: that we have moral beliefs at all, that we can reason about them (dismiss some and uphold others), and that we can distinguish between truth and illusion – these are all capacities essential to human reason and autonomy. And they are the basis for attributing dignity to human beings in the first place. In other words, while the fact C explains (via natural selection) our belief C, in the moral case it is our belief D, and our reflection upon it, that explains (via justification) the moral fact D.

<sup>9</sup> We might not have good reasons to attribute dignity to the bee-like humans in Darwin's story in any case: they seem to be determined to make certain (functional) judgements. Thus, they lack the autonomy that is the prerequisite for a being having dignity.

#### **Conclusion**

This threefold evolutionary challenge cannot, in the end, undermine the idea of inviolable human dignity. That is the conclusion of the analysis above: Kantian dignity ethics remain compatible with Darwinism as a scientific theory.

If taken seriously, however, an evolutionary understanding of the human being requires dignity ethics to think critically about some of its basic concepts and ideas – and probably to modify many of its claims. We have seen that the line between human beings and animals cannot be drawn as sharply as many have thought; and this might require us to attribute dignity to some non-human animals. We seem not to be unique: just at one end of a spectrum. A second insight arising from this has importance for any ethical system focusing on autonomy as its core value. If human beings have dignity *because* they are free and rational beings that can act morally, then it is important to understand that human freedom is a very complex phenomenon. Human beings are influenced and motivated much more by innate impulses than traditional analyses of freedom would suggest. This understanding will have practical consequences. It helps us to see more clearly, for example, how human beings can be manipulated, and, therefore, see how they may be protected from any such attack on their freedom.

If dignity ethics can learn these lessons from evolutionary theory, then Darwinism is certainly not ringing the '[death] knell of the virtue of mankind' but might, rather, cause dignity ethics to find more secure philosophical footings.
