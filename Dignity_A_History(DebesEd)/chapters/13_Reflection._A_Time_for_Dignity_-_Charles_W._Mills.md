# *Reflection*: A Time for Dignity 

*Charles W. Mills*

No philosopher is more celebrated than Immanuel Kant for his theoretical emphasis on the importance of *dignity* for our moral identities as human beings, or, more generally, persons. In these brief reflections, I want to raise some questions about this very familiar picture, and how it might need to be complicated once we take race into account.

In a series of essays beginning in the 1990s, various philosophers—Tsenay Serequeberhan, Emmanuel Eze, Mark Larrimore, Robert Bernasconi, Pauline Kleingeld, and others brought back to the discipline's attention the embarrassing fact that Kant was a racist and indeed has a good claim to be regarded as the founder of modern "scientific" racism.1 Thus the famous theorist of personhood also turns out to be a pioneering theorist of subpersonhood, at least in its modern form. (Other forms of racism, such as the theological and cultural, have been argued by some commentators to be much older, dating back to the classical epoch.)2 Kant demarcated humanity into a four-tier

hierarchy—Europeans, Asians, blacks, Native Americans—and, during his racist period, supported European colonialism and judged blacks and Native Americans to be natural slaves.3

Clearly, then, in a moral theory for which *autonomy*, the capacity for self-legislation and self-direction, is so crucial, it would be difficult to see such creatures as genuinely capable of dignity. Mainstream Kantians have generally either ignored this seeming contradiction in Kant's work or acknowledged it only in passing, while continuing on basically as before. I want to suggest here a different strategy by asking the question: how should a deracialized Kantianism (or Kantianism*) be reconstructed that would *take into account* this bifurcated racial history, this historic division in modernity between recognized persons (white) and persons not recognized as persons (e.g., blacks)?

For my belief is that to "continue as before" with a putatively "color-blind" assimilation of nonwhites to the white population in Kant's theoretical claims will only continue in a different form the *disrespect* showed by Kant and other white racist Enlightenment figures to people of color. Rather, we need to rethink how race affects personhood, dignity, respect, the *Rechtsstaat*, the temporality of history, as well as our duty to help bring about Kant's own cosmopolitan vision of a planetary "kingdom of ends." Facing the fact of a historically partitioned normativity requires us to explore and incorporate into a now modified apparatus the

Lott (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2002), 145–66; and Pauline Kleingeld, "Kant's Second Thoughts on Race," *Philosophical Quarterly* 57, no. 229 (2007): 573–92. Controversy exists on whether, in addition to the familiar precritical and critical periodization of Kant, we also need a racist and antiracist periodization (not coincident with the former) to register the fact that Kant (allegedly) changed his mind on race. Pauline Kleingeld argues for such a change, located in the 1790s—"Kant's Second Thoughts on Race"—while Robert Bernasconi denies it: "Kant's Third Thoughts on Race," in *Reading Kant's Geography*, ed. Stuart Elden and Eduardo Mendieta (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2011), 291–318.

radically different experience of racially subordinated peoples in modernity and a correspondingly divergent mapping of time, a competing "sociomental representation of the past," in the phrase of Eviatar Zerubavel.4

Consider, after all, some classic characterizations of blacks' status under white supremacy: blacks as a "*tertium quid*," "somewhere between men and cattle" (W. E. B. Du Bois); blacks as "a race without respect" (Marcus Garvey); "colonization" as a process of "thingification" (Aimé Césaire); blacks as inhabitants of "a zone of non-being" (Frantz Fanon).5 Unlike the situation for white persons, it is indignity rather than dignity that is the "default mode." Ignoring this history does not erase it but perpetuates it, insofar as moral consciousness both white and nonwhite is likely to continue to be shaped by this legacy of differential moral regard (think of the implications of the literature on "implicit bias," for example), while sociopolitical structures both local and global will still reveal the colonial or neocolonial normative blueprint.

How then should this history be addressed? A valuable guide here is Thomas McCarthy's recent book, *Race, Empire, and the Idea of Human Development*, 6 which, recognizing the failure of philosophies of history inspired by the Hegelian World-Spirit or underpinned by Marxist economic determinism, judges that "Kant's insistence on the primacy of practical reason makes him more of a contemporary than either Hegel or Marx."7 But a renovated Kantian philosophy of history must, of course, reject not just his racism, but also his own dubious teleology.

"practical anthropology" of the *Metaphysics of Morals*, 8 which "deals with morally relevant differences among *subgroups within the species*, that is, differences that make a difference in regard to the duties owed them,"9 can then be rewritten via a new concept of "race" that makes it a matter of social construction rather than intrinsic biological differentiation. The significance of "race" is now transformed by its reconceptualization as a sociohistorical structure whose "phenomenal" power over human "inclination" has been so great that it has motivated some persons to deny the personhood of others, and create racist polities accordingly. In colonialism, in slavery, in white supremacy, we have systems of government that are not slightly deviant from the *Rechtsstaat* but founded on principles that are its direct antithesis, the using of whole groups of persons as mere means, ignoring their own ends: the *Rassenstaat*. Moreover, the legacy of this betrayal of the Categorical Imperative has not vanished with the formal elimination of these systems. Rather it is still with us today, in structures of domination predicated on the ongoing exploitation of racial "Others" and in patterns of moral cognition shaped not merely by the past but by the enduringly inferior position of these Others.

Now we know that the achievement of the kingdom of ends requires the participation of all humans. To exclude some will be in violation of Kant's prescriptions in the *Groundwork* about the demands of "dignity": "the *share* which it affords to a rational being *in the making of universal law*, and which therefore fits him to be a member in a possible kingdom of ends."10 In racist societies, people of color will have been denied this share in universal lawmaking, viewed as "natural slaves" for whom autonomy is impossible and heteronomy

is all they can achieve. A merely formal inclusion of them in the (nominally) postracist polity will not suffice to re-establish the republic on a just footing. Rather, a substantive inclusion is necessary, one that—in keeping with the demands of "publicity"—expressly acknowledges these past violations of personhood, and the need to make up for them. Thus the justice that is integral to the *Rechtsstaat* requires, where such historic violations have occurred, correction to make up for past injustices. The "morally relevant differences among subgroups" that should guide the applications of the Categorical Imperative will now track racial subordination, not racial biology, prescribing duties of remediation.

And it is here that we run into a problem, for neither in Kant nor the liberal tradition generally is there any systematic treatment of corrective justice. As Samuel Fleischacker has documented, liberalism—contra its self-image of principled commitment to the repudiation of ascriptive hierarchy and the equal worth of all persons—has systematically elevated some persons above others.11 Not until the 1790s' writings and speeches of François-Noël ("Gracchus") Babeuf, guillotined in 1797 for his membership in the "Conspiracy of the Equals," do we get a commitment even to universal *distributive* justice delinked from intra-whitemale social status, and even then, of course, it continues to be generally linked to the social statuses of gender and race.12 As for *corrective* justice for the systemically subordinated, it is virtually untheorized—a pattern that continues to this very day in the work of John Rawls and his commentators.13 The temporality implicit

in Kant's metaphysics of morals is what I have called elsewhere a "white time,"14 a "time map" (Zerubavel) that refuses to recognize the moral significance for history of the West's racial oppression of people of color, its denial of their equal personhood, and the challenge it raises for their achievement of (recognized) dignity within the global kingdom of ends.

I suggest, then, that a rethinking of the temporality of Kant's philosophy of history that would highlight the different experiences within modernity of white and nonwhite "persons," and corresponding white and nonwhite "times," would demand the reconstruction of an aggressively antiracist Kantian conception of "dignity" and radical corrective justice for those who have been systematically denied it. We know that Kant's philosophy of punishment (a particular variety of corrective justice) is famously uncompromising, condemning any guiding principle other than "the principle of equality."15 Were the "making of universal law" to be extended to include "equal" principles of corrective social justice grounded in the reclamation of their dignity by people of color for the indignities historically inflicted upon them by global white supremacy, the deontological implications for the transformation of the planet would presumably be equally uncompromising. *Fiat justitia ruat caelum!*
