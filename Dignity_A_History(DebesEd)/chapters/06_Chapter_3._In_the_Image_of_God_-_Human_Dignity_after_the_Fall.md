# Chapter 3: In the Image of God - Human Dignity after the Fall

*Bonnie Kent*

Christian writings from late antiquity through the Middle Ages have a great deal to say about the biblical account of creation, including the passage declaring that God made humans in his image (Gen. 1:26–27). The literature from the Latin West also has much to say about the dignity (*dignitas*) of various beings and things.1 Many texts discuss the dignity of God or Christ, the angels, Christ's followers, or kings, bishops, priests, and other people with special offices. Other texts discuss the dignity of the soul, various powers of the soul, or different virtues or gifts of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, very few works expatiate on some dignity that all people have just because we are human, or because humans are created in God's image. Rarely do patristic and medieval authors argue for the species-wide, species-specific human

dignity we often hear about today, especially in debates about human rights.

Consider, for example, Peter Lombard's *Sentences*, the standard theology textbook for universities from the thirteenth century all the way to the sixteenth. It discusses whether the soul has more dignity when not united to the body, whether the Incarnation diminished God's dignity, and whether God created some angels with more dignity than others, to mention only a few contexts where issues of dignity arise. The *Sentences* says nothing about a dignity that all humans have just because we are human, or because humans are created in the image of God. Medieval commentaries on the *Sentences* usually follow the same pattern, but not because of any special reverence for Peter Lombard's opinions. While most thirteenth-century commentators labored to cover all the problems Peter himself raised, they felt free to argue against his positions. By the early fourteenth century, commentators felt equally free to ignore issues Peter raised and explore issues they themselves considered more important. The dignity of all human beings, qua human, was not among them.

I do not mean to suggest that no patristic or medieval texts focus on the dignity of human beings as such, only that it takes scholars effort to unearth them. The list of works so far produced is quite short. It includes two brief, anonymous texts from the Carolingian era, circulated mainly as a composite treatise; a couple of works by John Scotus Eriugena (d. ca. 877), *De spiritu et anima*, an anonymous treatise believed to date from the twelfth century; and various passages from the writings of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253). Notable by their absence are works by the bestknown and most influential thinkers of the Latin West.

Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) is no exception: only on rare occasion does he discuss the dignity of human beings as such. Aquinas's *Summa theologiae* even argues that people can fall away from human dignity by sinning, becoming in a way like mindless animals, so that it can be good to kill them.2 Contemporary readers are often surprised by

<sup>2</sup> This argument is discussed below in the text.

this passage, less because Aquinas supports capital punishment than because of the reasons he gives. The argument leads some to conclude that Leo the Great, a fifth-century pope, gave a more robust account of human dignity than Aquinas produced eight hundred years later. Leo, we are told, taught that all humans have dignity because all are made in the image of God—in contrast to Aquinas, who regarded dignity as "an ethical, not an ontological category."3

It is easy to see why contemporary readers might find Leo's work attractive. Dignity is a recurring theme in his sermons. As we will see, though, the similarities between his views and those of Aquinas far exceed the differences. As Leo thinks that people lose dignity when they commit serious sins, so Aquinas thinks that all humans have a dignity that comes from capacities of the soul lacking in nonhuman animals. Neither argues for the species-wide, species-specific human dignity often discussed today. The dignity Leo celebrates is one he thinks all human beings *can* have, but that only Christians actually have.

Why does the patristic and medieval literature, which has so much to say about the image-of-God passage, have so little to say about human dignity? In this chapter I argue that two factors do much to explain why human dignity gets far less attention than modern readers might expect:

- 1. As most authors interpreted scripture, human beings were not the apex of creation. While they believed that God made humans in his image, they believed that he also made angels, and with even greater dignity. Angels were created immortal, so that, by their very nature, they cannot die. The same is true of the human soul but not of human beings as a whole, body and soul together. Equally important, God gave angels as well

Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss (Dordrecht: Springer, 2007), 94; Carlos Ruiz Miguel, "Human Dignity: History of an Idea," *Jahrbuch des öffentlichen Rechts der Gegenwart* 22 (2002): 285–86.

as humans understanding, will, and free choice. The kind of dignity that comes from having such capacities, then, belongs to all rational creatures, not to humans alone.

- 2. As the creation story came to be understood in the Latin West, it was only the beginning of a narrative of humankind's sin and redemption. The narrative is predicated on the assumption that human nature is mutable. It was so badly deformed by the Fall that it needs to be reformed in the likeness of Christ, the second Adam. So even if humans alone had been made in the image of God, being made in the image of God has less importance than being remade in the likeness of Christ. Christians have a dignity that no other humans do, and they alone can attain eternal happiness; but even Christians must still struggle with lingering effects of the Fall. They must take care not to lose their dignity by committing serious sins.
To understand the basis for these views, we need to consider how patristic and medieval authors interpreted scripture. The account of creation alone raises more exegetical puzzles than a casual reader would notice. Read farther, to the story of the first humans' disobedience and punishment, and the problems quickly multiply. To solve them Christian thinkers looked to other parts of the Bible, including and especially Paul's epistles. How one ought to interpret Paul itself became a topic of controversy.

I will pay particular attention to works by Augustine (d. 430) because the dominant narrative of sin and redemption was largely of his devising. Its popularity in the Latin West during the Middle Ages owes something to the respect that later Christian thinkers had for his teachings, but also something to official church doctrine. Beginning with the condemnations of Pelagian teachings in the early fifth century, anyone who insisted that human nature as it exists now is in the same condition that it was before the Fall could be charged with heresy.

The idea that Adam merely set a bad example for his descendants was firmly rejected.

The dominant narrative grants that even fallen human beings have rational capacities lacking in animals. By nature humans also have a higher end than animals: to know and love God for all eternity, thereby enjoying perfect, everlasting happiness. In these respects human beings never degenerate to the level of beasts. At the same time, the narrative denies that people's rational capacities alone enable them to attain the ultimate end, and it focuses much more on salvation than creation. Ultimately, the only alternative to eternal happiness is eternal suffering in hell, a fate that pigs and chickens need not fear.

Besides rational capacities, what do people need to attain the ultimate end? According to the dominant narrative, we need the grace of baptism to remove the guilt of original sin and make us members of Christ's church. With the possible exception of infants, we also need spiritual dispositions and virtues that make us more Christlike. Although these dispositions and virtues give people the greatest dignity it is possible for humans to have, they can be lost by sinning and restored only through penance and God's grace. Obviously, this is not a narrative that present-day advocates for human rights would find helpful. It places too little weight on creation, too much weight on Christ's sacrifice and God's grace, and thoroughly resists secularization.

Let me issue a couple of caveats before proceeding. First, this chapter focuses on Christian writings from the Latin West. It does not consider works by the Greek Fathers or explore differences between the eastern and western church. Second, this chapter does not take up a good many issues that theologians consider important. I write on the assumption that most readers have a limited tolerance for theology, so that it is best to stay out of the weeds insofar as I possibly can.

## Between Angels and Beasts

For at least the first fourteen hundred years of Christian thought in the West, *dignitas* had the same meanings that it did in Roman literature and philosophy. It did not signify a special kind of worth possessed only by human beings, or even only by living beings. It was an ordinary Latin word with a wide range of meanings, including a purely aesthetic one, so that people spoke of the *dignitas* of speeches, poems, and buildings as well as the *dignitas* of God, angels, and humans. While the word was often used to signify high value or worth, there was nothing incoherent about the claim that everything created by God has *dignitas*, from the angels of heaven all the way down to the lowest earthly things.4 Readers may underestimate just how common *dignitas* is in Latin texts because it often appears in English translations as "worth," "honor," or something other than the cognate "dignity."

The Latin Bible represents a notable exception to the liberal use of *dignitas.* Very seldom is any form of this noun used in the Vulgate.5 It does not appear anywhere in the New Testament, nor does it appear anywhere in the book of Genesis. The account of creation, now often seen as evidence of human dignity, actually says nothing about dignity of any kind. Perhaps this is for the best, because the text raises so many other problems.

One problem is that the creation story says nothing explicit about God's making angels; yet there are over two hundred references to angels in the Bible, some of them even in later chapters of Genesis (Gen. 19:1–15, 48:16). Since God plainly created angels at some point, biblical scholars were left wondering when he created them. On the first day, when he created the heavens? Is the creation of light an

oblique reference to God's creation of the angels? When God says, "Let us make a human being to our image and likeness" (Gen. 1:26), is he speaking to the angels, so that the plural includes them, or is the plural instead a reference to the Trinity?

Regardless of when God made the angels, scriptural passages referring to them suggest that they occupy a higher place than humans in the hierarchy of creation. Angels serve as both the messengers and warriors of God. Sometimes he sends them to guide and protect humans; sometimes he sends them simply to enforce his will, as when he stations angels at the east of Eden to prevent Adam and Eve from returning (Gen. 3:24). Indeed, Psalm 8 expresses wonder that God cares about human beings as much as he does. In the Vulgate it reads:

For I will look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established; What is a human being, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you visit him?

Yet you have made him a little less than the angels, and you have crowned him with glory and honor. (Ps. 8:4–6)

The author of Hebrews, interpreting "the son of man" as a reference to Christ, concludes that Christ was a little less than the angels during his life as a human being, but is now crowned with glory and honor in heaven (Heb. 2:7–9). According to the gospel of Luke, Christ himself promised his followers that, in the resurrection, they will become "equal to the angels." No longer will they be able to die (Luke 20:36). Notice, though, that Christ's promise does not answer an important question: did humans become inferior to angels only because of Adam's sin, or did God make humans inferior from the outset?

Augustine argues that God gave Adam and Eve immortal souls, so that in this respect they were equal to angels. Their bodies, however, were inferior—not so constituted that they were doomed from the outset to die, but still in need of food and drink to survive. If Adam

and Eve had obeyed God, eventually their bodies would have been transformed into spiritual, immortal bodies. Because they disobeyed, human bodies from then on would inevitably age and die.6 In contrast, God made angels spiritual beings unable to die, so that they have greater natural dignity or worth than even the first humans did. Augustine describes them as having spiritual bodies needing no nourishment and "full of light."7

In book 12 of *City of God* Augustine gives a memorable summary of his position. Although humans were created below angels in the cosmic hierarchy, they were also given free will, so that they could either rise to the level of angels or sink to living like animals:

[God] created the human being's nature as a kind of intermediate between angels and beasts, so that if he submitted to his creator as to his true lord, and kept his commandments with pious obedience, he would pass over into the fellowship of the angels, attaining without an intervening death blessed immortality without end; but if he offended the Lord his God by exercising his free will arrogantly and disobediently, he would live like the beasts, sentenced to death, the slave of his own appetites, and destined after death for eternal punishment.8

Of course, even fallen human nature remains human. When scripture speaks of being sentenced to "live like the beasts," Augustine does not take it to mean that humans become beasts, as they sometimes do in ancient mythology.9 Humans can suffer eternal punishment precisely because we have immortal souls, not the mortal souls that animals do. We also still have capacities of the soul, however damaged, that animals

lack. So even sinful human beings, enslaved to our own desires and destined for hell, have more dignity than animals.

Aquinas agrees that even sinful human beings have more dignity than animals. In his works, though, the differences between angels and humans become greater than they are in Augustine's. Most thirteenth-century theologians share Augustine's view that everything other than God is a composite of matter and form. Aquinas argues, to the contrary, that angels are entirely incorporeal. Like other created things, they are composites of essence and existence, but they are not composites of form and matter. Given Aquinas's conception of matter as the principal of individuation, it follows that there cannot be different angels of the same species. Each one is sui generis.10 Furthermore, angels do not think discursively, as humans do; they immediately grasp truths that the human intellect could grasp only with time and effort. As angels have superior minds, Aquinas argues, so too do they enjoy more perfect freedom than we do.11 Thus he concludes that angels were created more in God's image than humans and have more dignity than humans.12 Even if Adam and Eve had not sinned, they would have remained below angels in the cosmic hierarchy.

The thesis that angels were created more in God's image than humans raises a more basic question: what does it mean to be created in God's image? Since the account of creation in Genesis gives no explanation, answers varied. Even if two thinkers were in complete agreement about how Adam and Eve were originally in God's image, they might still disagree about the consequences of the first humans' disobedience. Does the image of God remain intact in their descendants? Or has it been disfigured, perhaps even entirely lost?

## God's Image, Deformed and Reformed

As biblical scholars commonly point out, Genesis gives two accounts of the creation of Adam and Eve: the first in chapter 1 and the second in chapter 2. The two differ significantly. According to the first account, God created both Adam and Eve in his image. The text says nothing about God's making one before the other or making them from material he had already created (Gen. 1:26–27). According to the second account, Adam is primary and Eve derivative. God made Adam first, from "the slime of the earth," and breathed life into him. Later God decided it was not good for Adam to be alone; so he sent Adam to sleep and proceeded to make Eve from one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:7, 18, 21–23). We see here some of the scriptural basis for debates, running from late antiquity all the way to the present, about whether men alone are made in the image of God (*imago Dei*).13

Even considered on its own, the first account of creation provided plenty of fuel for debate. The text reads:

And [God] said: Let us make a human being to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature.

And God created the human to his image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them. (Gen. 1:26–27)

In book 2 of his *Sentences,* where Peter Lombard (d. 1160) grapples with this passage, he raises what he took to be standard questions about it. Is "likeness" just a synonym for "image," or do these words have different meanings? Is Christ alone truly the image of God? Most important, at least for present purposes, *in which respects* were the first

<sup>13</sup> For a helpful historical survey see Kari Elisabeth Børresen, ed., *The Image of God: Gender Models in Judaeo-Christian Tradition* (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995), esp. 187–235.

human beings created in God's image and likeness?14 Finding different opinions in patristic writings about which features belong to the image and which to the likeness, Peter settles for reciting some of them without saying explicitly which he favors. In book 1 of the *Sentences*, however, he endorsed Augustine's view that the human soul is the image of the Trinity in its capacities for memory, understanding, and will or love. Thus there is reason to think that Peter favors the first opinion he reports about the image-and-likeness passage: namely, that humankind was made in the image and likeness of God "with respect to mind, by which humans exceed nonrational beings"—"in his image, according to memory, understanding, and love; in his likeness according to innocence and righteousness, which exist naturally in the rational mind."15

While the other opinions that Peter reports differ in detail, they reflect two tendencies common in the Latin West: first, to focus on attributes of the mind or rational soul rather than attributes of the human soul as a whole or the human soul and the body together; and second, to include both rational capacities, such as understanding (*intellectus*), and traits considered spiritual dispositions, such as righteousness (*iustitia*). As we know, the focus on attributes of the rational soul reflects the belief that angels too were created in God's image, and possibly even more in God's image than humans; but why is there a mixture of rational capacities and spiritual dispositions?

When contemporary Christians argue that humans are made in God's image, they normally focus on capacities alone, such as the capacity for love or free choice.16 Since the aim is to prove that *all* human beings have dignity, it would be counterproductive to bring in spiritual or moral dispositions that human adults often lack. In contrast, the views Peter Lombard reports are so many different opinions about

human nature in its original form, as God created it in Adam and Eve. Far from assuming that human nature remains unchanged in us, they assume that it has changed for the worse because of the Fall. Although we still have capacities like understanding and will, they do not function as they should, and we have lost the spiritual dispositions God bestowed upon Adam and Eve, such as righteousness or the love of virtue. One of the most disastrous changes is in freedom of choice. Where Adam and Eve had the power to sin or not to sin, we ourselves cannot avoid sinning. Without God's healing grace, we remain enslaved to our own appetites.17 This account of the human condition reflects the doctrine of original sin presented in Augustine's later works, especially in treatises against Pelagius (d. ca. 420) and his followers. Long before Peter Lombard's time, Augustine's teachings had, at least in broad outline, become firmly entrenched in the Latin West.

At first Augustine claimed that the image of God had been totally destroyed by Adam's sin. In later works he retracted this opinion, on the grounds that humans would cease to be rational, morally responsible agents—in effect, would cease to be human—if the image were entirely destroyed. He argued instead that the image of God has been grossly deformed, so that it needs to be *re*formed in Christ, "the second Adam."18 This particular change did not reflect a more optimistic view on the human condition. On the contrary, the doctrine of original sin developed in Augustine's works from 386 onward places growing emphasis on the effects of the Fall and our need for God's grace.

According to Augustine, Adam's descendants inherit both the guilt of his sin and its effects. Only through the grace of baptism can the guilt be remitted. Without baptism, even infants are doomed to hell; but even after baptism, Christians still show the effects of original sin in their tendencies towards self-centeredness, moral blindness, and

<sup>18</sup> Augustine, *De spiritu et littera* (*On the Spirit and the Letter*), 28.48; *Retractationes* (*The Retractations*), 2.51.

weakness of will. Lacking the spiritual dispositions bestowed upon Adam and Eve, and with impaired rational capacities, Christians can never attain perfect virtue in their earthly lives. No matter how hard they try to avoid it, they are bound to sin. Hence Augustine flays pagan philosophers for teaching that humans can indeed become perfectly virtuous, and more, through their own efforts. For him all true virtues are gifts of grace. The virtues extolled by pagans are vices in disguise.19

The doctrine of original sin arises mainly from Augustine's reading of Paul's epistles. He takes them to mean that Adam's sin was not his alone: all of humankind sinned "*in* Adam" and thereby became destined to die. Only through the gift of Christ's sacrifice can people again become righteous and enjoy eternal life (Rom. 5:12–21). For this very reason Paul refers to a second Adam, of heaven rather than the earth (1 Cor. 15:45–47). From Augustine's perspective, then, people who deny original sin are bound to underestimate our need for grace and misunderstand the role of Christ. If a single human being could be righteous apart from the grace of Christ, Augustine argues, then Christ died in vain.20

There was no serious conflict among Christians about whether God became a human being in order to save sinners. Multiple passages of the New Testament deliver this message. The message is nonetheless open to various interpretations, and Augustine's understanding of it triggered objections. On his view, the sole reason for the Incarnation is that Adam's sin did such terrible damage to his descendants. The Incarnation was not a tribute to human dignity, let alone an award for human merit. It was the only way fallen human beings could be redeemed. Since every one of us shares in the guilt of Adam's sin, even

newborn babies need the grace of Christ in order to be spared eternal punishment.21

The greatest challenge to this riveting narrative came from Pelagius and his followers, the foremost defenders in the early church of human dignity. They denied that Adam's sin damaged anyone but himself, except insofar as he set a bad example. On the contrary, all people are born in the same condition as Adam and Eve before the Fall: sinless, and with an unimpaired capacity to choose either good or evil. We succeed or fail according to our individual efforts. We can therefore remain sinless if we exert ourselves to the utmost. While Pelagius and his followers agreed that people need God's grace, they rejected Augustine's idea that we need it to repair damage done to human nature. One might argue, then, that Augustine did them an injustice in casting them as "enemies of grace."22 But from his perspective, Pelagians not only underestimated the importance of Christ, they overestimated the capacities of human nature after the Fall, just as pagan philosophers did. If it is possible to be sinless merely by exerting oneself to the utmost, why has no descendant of Adam ever accomplished this feat?

Augustine's long, bitter campaign against Pelagian teachings largely succeeded. His doctrine of original sin was affirmed by African councils of the church in 416 and 418. In 431, the year following his death, an ecumenical council at Ephesus followed suit. A letter was sent to bishops of the West speaking highly of Augustine's life and works and confirming that the teachings of Pelagius and his followers had been condemned.23

While the condemnations did not explicitly prohibit or prescribe any specific opinions about human dignity, they help to explain why

the narrative of creation, Fall, and redemption became so entrenched, and with it, the idea that the image of God, now disfigured, needs to be reformed. Christians remained free to praise human dignity as God created it in Adam and Eve, or the dignity of human nature, however damaged, as it still exists after the Fall, but as aspects of a longer story culminating in the salvation of *some* humans through the grace of Christ. Nobody on earth, however, could be entirely confident about her ultimate destiny. Christians could lose their special dignity by sinning and regain it only through penance and God's grace.

## Money, Mice, and Maids: Different Kinds of Dignity

With this background, readers might better understand Augustine's remarks about human dignity in *On Free Choice,* a dialogue far more popular today than any of his anti-Pelagian treatises. When he started writing it, his chief target was Manichaean dualism. For this reason he emphasizes the dignity of God-given human nature, even in sinful human beings:

Just as a horse that strays is better than a stone that does not stray only because it has no movement or perception of its own, so a creature that sins by free will is more excellent than one that does not sin because it has no free will. And I would praise wine as something good of its kind, but blame a person who got drunk on the wine, and yet I would prefer that person, drunk and blameworthy, to the wine on which he got drunk…. Even perverse and intoxicated people—ruined by their greed for this same thing, praiseworthy on its own level—are to be preferred to it, not because of the merit of their vices but because of the dignity of their nature.24

<sup>24</sup> Augustine, *De libero arbitrio* (*On Free Choice*), 3.5.15.

Why are even sinful humans better than good horses? Augustine's answer prescinds from their individual defects and focuses on the dignity of their *nature*. Only later in the dialogue does Augustine explain that he uses "human nature" in two senses: to mean the nature with which human beings were first created, but also to mean the nature of their descendants, "mortal and ignorant and enslaved to the flesh."25 Although humans still have the rational capacities of understanding and will, capacities that animals lack, even these capacities are now impaired. Augustine was furious that Pelagians quoted selectively from the dialogue in support of their own views, ignoring the sections that contradicted them.26

In book 11 of *City of God,* a work completed over thirty years later, Augustine gives a much clearer account of dignity than he offers in *On Free Choice.* Not only does he present his distinction between natural dignity and instrumental value, he argues that righteousness trumps even natural dignity:

Among those things that in some way exist, and are distinct from the God who made them, living things are placed above nonliving things, just as those that have the power of reproducing, or even desiring it, are placed above those lacking this impulse; and among living things, the sentient are placed above the nonsentient, as animals are above trees; and among those with understanding, the immortal are placed above the mortal, as angels are above human beings. These, however, are places in the order of nature. There is another way of assessing things according to the use someone has for them, so that we sometimes prefer certain nonsentient things to sentient things…. For example, who would not prefer to have food in his house rather than mice, or money rather than fleas? Why wonder, then, that even in the

<sup>25</sup> Augustine, *De libero arbitrio*, 3.19.54.

<sup>26</sup> Augustine complains about this at some length in *Retractationes*, 1.9.

assessment of human beings themselves, whose nature is certainly of great dignity, a horse is often more precious than a servant, and a gem more precious than a maid? As far as freedom of judgment is concerned, the reason of a thoughtful person is very different from the necessity of a needy person or the pleasure of a person desiring something. For reason considers what degree of value a thing has in itself, whereas necessity thinks about that on account of which it seeks the thing; and reason considers what is shown to be true according to the light of the mind, whereas pleasure looks for what is agreeable in gratifying the bodily senses. But the will and love have such great weight in the value of rational natures that good human beings are placed above bad angels according to the law of righteousness, even though angels are above humans in the order of nature.27

There is nothing original about Augustine's description of the order of nature: the place something has depends on its God-given capacities. The closer they are to God's, the higher the thing's rank in the order of creation. Nor is Augustine original in distinguishing between natural dignity, on the one hand, and mere utility value, on the other. Yet he does not stop here. He advances his own distinction between someone who judges freely and according to reason, considering the value things have in themselves, and someone who judges them in terms of her own physical pleasure or her "necessity."

By "necessity" Augustine means the compulsion we feel to get more of something than we objectively need. Our need for air, for example, rarely influences our value judgments because we seldom perceive a need for it. As long as air is readily available and our respiratory organs work, we feel no compulsion to get more air.

gratification.28 Far from seeing the lust to dominate others as something natural to us, Augustine thinks it reflects the disordering of human nature caused by the Fall.29

Even when we do value things according to their God-given natures, Augustine concludes, we should not think that this is the sole criterion for judgment. Because it matters so much what rational creatures love and how they choose to behave, human beings can, with God's grace, attain a place equal to the good angels and above the bad ones. Unlike Pelagius and his followers, Augustine sees no grounds for despair in the deep, perpetual need for God's grace. While people suffer the consequences of a sin that they did not individually commit, they can also benefit from a sacrifice that they did not individually make.

## Leo the Great and Thomas Aquinas

Anyone who reads the sermons of Leo the Great will be struck by how often he exhorts his listeners to remember the dignity of their nature.30 This can make Leo appear closer to modern proponents of human dignity than to Augustine, the tireless prosecutor of Pelagians. In fact, Leo himself strongly opposed Pelagianism. Even before his ordination as a bishop he began working to suppress it. The dignity he invokes in his sermons is primarily the dignity that Christians have through God's grace. In exhorting his congregants to remember their dignity Leo was also warning them against sliding back into old, bad habits.

<sup>28</sup> Augustine, *Contra Iulianum* (*Against Julian*), 4.14.68.

<sup>29</sup> Augustine sees *superbia—*pride, or perhaps more accurately, arrogance*—*as the source of Adam's sin and likewise the principal root of all sin in fallen human nature. But only later did Christian thinkers develop the scheme of the seven capital vices (or "deadly sins") and begin arguing about exactly where one vice or another, such as lust or anger, ranks on the list.

Antoine Chavasse, Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina, vols. 128 and 128A (Turnhout: Brepols, 1973). The chapter numbers of the *Tractatus* that I give correspond with the sermon numbers in English translations. I cite the chapter number followed by the relevant page number(s) in the critical edition.

As Christians are always capable of growing, so too are they always at risk of degenerating.31

Leo's understanding of human dignity clearly reflects Augustine's influence. He does not proclaim some universal human dignity that all people have because God made Adam and Eve in his image. Leo mourns the loss of human dignity in Adam and celebrates its restoration in Christ:

Wake up, human being, and recognize the dignity of your nature. Recall that you have been made *according to the image of God*, which, although it has been corrupted in Adam, has nevertheless been reformed in Christ.32

… The human being has been made according to the image of God in order that he might imitate his creator; and our kind has this natural dignity if the form of divine benevolence gleams in us as a kind of mirror. Certainly the Savior's grace restores us to this form on a daily basis, as long as that which fell in the first Adam is raised up in the second.33

The claim that Christ's grace restores us on a daily basis serves as a reminder that baptism is no guarantee of a place in heaven. Since people can lose their dignity by sinning, they have a continual need for grace. Leo makes the warning more explicit in a sermon he preached during Lent:

Let us seek divine help by the observance of the heavenly mandates, knowing that we cannot otherwise prevail against our enemies unless we prevail against ourselves. There are many struggles within ourselves: "the flesh lusts against the spirit," for one thing, and "the

spirit lusts against the flesh," for another [Gal. 5:17]. If in this strife the desires of the body are stronger, the soul will shamefully lose the dignity proper to it, and it will be ruinous for it to be a slave to what it ought to govern.34

When we turn from Leo's sermons to the works of Thomas Aquinas, we find all the sophistication, but also all the complexities, of scholastic theology. Aquinas so often appeals to the works of Aristotle and his commentators that one can easily underestimate the extent of Augustine's influence.35 In Aquinas's treatment of original sin, though, extensive quotations from Augustine make his influence manifest. Aquinas's own teacher, Albert the Great, had ventured to suggest that God would have become incarnate even if humankind had not sinned. Aquinas reports this opinion as well as Augustine's opinion to the contrary: that if humankind had not sinned, God would not have become incarnate. Noting that scripture repeatedly gives humankind's sin as the reason for the Incarnation, Aquinas sides with Augustine. He adds that his position should not be interpreted as a limit on God's power. God *could* have become incarnate even if there had been no sin.36

This understanding of the Incarnation suggests that we should take it as (humbling) evidence of God's compassion, not as evidence that human beings have greater dignity than all other creatures. As Augustine makes this point, so too does Aquinas. He grants that humans have more dignity than nonrational animals, so that in this sense it was fitting that God become incarnate as a human; but since angels are rational as well, rationality alone cannot explain the Incarnation. Why, then, did God become incarnate as a human instead

of as an angel? According to Aquinas, the answer lies not in human dignity but in human *need*. 37

At last we come to the notorious argument for capital punishment in Aquinas's *Summa theologiae*. It makes more sense when seen in the context of the work as a whole. When Aquinas discusses creation in Part 1 of the *Summa*, he defines a *person* as an individual with a rational nature. Here he defends the special dignity of all persons, ranging from God through angels to humans. As we know, he also argues that humans and angels are the only creatures made in God's image. While human nature is a less perfect image of God than angelic nature, we are still well above brute animals in the hierarchy of creation.38 At the same time Aquinas grants the point made in Augustine's *City of God*: rational beings have a value beyond the value God gave them in creation, so that some virtuous humans can ultimately come to surpass some of the angels.39

When Aquinas argues for capital punishment in the second part of Part 2, he has moved beyond the metaphysics of creation, through psychology and ethics in general, into a treatise on Christian ethics. He begins with the God-given virtues of faith, hope, and charity, then presents his account of God-given cardinal virtues, along with vices and sins opposed to them. The cardinal virtue of justice leads to a discussion of murder, including the question of whether it is lawful to kill sinners. Aquinas argues that it is lawful if the individual is not merely a sinner but a serious danger to the community, so that killing him is necessary for the common good. In subsequent articles he clarifies his position. Not only does he argue that only a publicly appointed authority may kill a sinner, he argues that someone operating as a private person cannot even kill herself without committing a mortal sin.40

The passage where Aquinas contends that people can become beastlike by sinning, so that it can be good to kill them, is not included in his main response to the question about the lawfulness of killing sinners. He presents this argument in reply to one of the opening arguments, which claims that killing a human being is evil in itself and therefore never lawful, under any circumstances. Aquinas's reply appeals to scripture as well as Aristotle:

In sinning a human withdraws from the order of reason and hence falls away from human dignity, according to which a human is naturally free and exists for his own sake, and he falls in a certain way (*quoddammodo*) into the servitude of beasts, so that it is ordained that he be treated according as he is useful to others, according to the Psalm [48:11], "The human, when he was in honor, did not understand; he has been compared to senseless beasts and made like them," and as it is said in Proverbs [11:29], "The fool shall serve the wise." And for this reason, although killing a human who remains in his own dignity is intrinsically evil, nevertheless killing a sinner can be good, just as killing a beast can be good. For a bad human being is worse than a beast and more harmful, as the Philosopher says in *Politics* I and [*Nicomachean*] *Ethics* VII.41

Aquinas's qualification—that some sinners fall *in a certain way* into the servitude of beasts—indicates that they have not altogether lost their personhood. Even so, readers might well wonder how executing people can make them useful to others. By making an example of them, so that the death penalty deters others from sinning? While this might be the case, Aquinas probably has something more in mind.

In his *Disputed Questions on Truth* Aquinas uses the same passage from Psalms to argue that God's providence always treats people justly.

<sup>41</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, II–II.64.2 ad 3. This passage looks more radical in the English Dominicans' translation of the *Summa theologiae*, which omits the qualification "in a certain way."

If they live in a way consistent with human dignity, nothing will happen to them that is not for their own good; but if they do not, God ordains that they be treated like brute animals, for the good of others.42 This conception of God's providence is one that Augustine repeatedly defends, arguing that God brings good even from the evil of sin. In both cases the central idea is one of order. If human beings choose higher goods over lower ones, as God intended, they preserve divine order. If they instead choose lower goods over higher ones, thereby making bad use of their capacity for free choice, punishing them serves to restore the order they violated.

## Conclusion

I have argued that two factors do much to explain why the patristic and medieval literature has little to say about the species-wide, speciesspecific human dignity commonly debated today. First, most authors believed that humans are not the sole creatures with the capacities for understanding and free choice. Not only do angels have the same capacities, possibly in even higher form, they are spiritual beings that, by their very nature, cannot die. It seemed reasonable to conclude, then, that God gave angels even greater dignity than he gave Adam and Eve. Second, most authors thought that human nature is not in the same condition that it was when God created it. According to what I have called the dominant narrative, the image of God in humankind had been deformed by the Fall; it needs to be reformed in the likeness of Christ; and cannot be reformed in any other way. It follows that Christians, through God's gift of grace, have a dignity that other people lack. (Remember, though, that Christians can lose their dignity by sinning. Whether they recover it depends, yet again, on God's grace.)

Let me close with some very brief remarks about a dissenting strain in medieval thought, with a higher assessment of human dignity. It faults the dominant narrative for placing too much emphasis on rational capacities of the soul that humans share with the angels. After all, the human soul's powers include animal functions, such as sense perception, and even "vegetable" functions like growth. Equally important, humans have an immortal soul made by God to desire union with the body. The whole that the two form gives the human being unique status as a microcosm: a reflection of all living things. So in making Adam from the earth, the dissenting strain claims, God did not give him less dignity than he gave the angels. On the contrary, God made the human being the most honored of all living creatures.

Versions of this line of argument appear in works by John Scotus Eriugena and Robert Grosseteste, as well as in the composite treatise entitled *On the Dignity of the Creation of Humanity*. 43 In Grosseteste's work it comes combined with another doctrine still sometimes mistaken for an innovation by John Duns Scotus. Some call it the primacy of Christ, others the absolute predestination of Christ. Defenders of this doctrine grant that Christ redeemed humankind from sin, but they argue for a counterfactual: Christ would have become incarnate even if there had been no Fall. For it is the union of God and humanity in Christ that unifies creation and fulfills God's plan for the universe.44

Christian variations on the ancient theme of human being as microcosm certainly support claims for the special dignity of humankind. One might wonder, though, whether they give the kind of support that contemporary defenders of human dignity would welcome. Arguments for the primacy of Christ might do better than the dominant narrative in celebrating specifically human dignity, but only in a derivative way, and they prove every bit as resistant to secularization.
