# *Reflection*: Dignity in Confucian and Buddhist Thought 

*David B. Wong*

The concept of dignity in the western tradition may be understood as the concept of inherent and unearned worth that entitles each person respectful attitudes and treatment. Classical Confucian and Buddhist thought contain concepts that overlap in meaning with this concept, making possible a three-way dialogue. The parties discuss dignity in sufficiently different ways to make their dialogue challenging to all concerned.

Mencius (fourth century bce) arguably employs the clearest indication of something like a moral concept of dignity in Confucianism. In 6A10 Mencius asserts that a wayfarer will reject even at the risk of death a basketful of rice and a bowlful of soup when offered contemptuously. A beggar will not demean himself by taking them if they have been trampled upon. In each case, the man is plausibly construed as defending his dignity. Mencius holds that such reactions emerge from inborn dispositions he calls *duan* (beginnings or sprouts).[^1] These are inborn dispositions to think and feel in response to certain kinds of events. If nurtured appropriately, the *duan* will make one an exemplary person, a *junzi.* The term originally had an aristocratic meaning—"son of a prince"—but later evolved with considerable influence to mean a kind of moral nobility that could be achieved by a person from any background. There are hints, but only hints, of this change in the *Zhou yi* (a divination text that contains references as early as the eleventh century bce and that was later incorporated into the *I Ching*, or Book of Changes). A more clearly moral meaning emerges in the *Shijing*, or *Book of Poetry* (with material dating from the seventh century to eleventh century bce), and the change comes to fruition in the *Lunyu* or *Analects* of Confucius (551–479 bce). The development of the Confucian concept of dignity, then, parallels the development of the western tradition from basing dignity on social rank to something that everyone has.

A person's disposition to reject demeaning treatment belongs to the *duan* that feels shame and dislike. One could dislike and regard as shameful something that one could do or has done or what others could do or have done. To accept demeaning treatment would be shameful, but to treat others in a demeaning way would also be shameful. One's responsibility to treat others as having worth is often put as the responsibility to *jing* others. In the Confucian literature, especially the texts of Mencius and Xunzi (fourth–third century bce), to *jing* others is to respect them as having worth, in virtue of which they are due careful regard or attention (indeed, one of the related and primary meanings of *jing* is seriousness;[^2] see Chan 2006). Among those mentioned as appropriate objects of *jing* are one's parents (*Analects* 4.18), one's master (*Mencius* 4B31), one's elders (6A5), and the virtuous (*Xunzi* 51/13/40). However, there are mentions of *jing*-ing everyone (*Mencius* 4B28; *Xunzi* 16/6/31).

This disposition is the beginning of the virtue of *yi*, which is most often translated as "righteousness," and should be understood as the virtue of being able to identify and act according to what is right and wrong.[^3] The other beginnings are the feeling of *bu ren ren zhi xin*, "not being able to bear the suffering of others" (most often translated as "compassion"), which can grow into the virtue of *ren* (translated variously as "humanity," "benevolence," and "humanheartedness"), which involves attitudes and conduct that express care for and love of others), the feeling of deference for others such as one's parents and elders, which grows into *li* (observing ritual propriety in ceremonies such as weddings and funerals and daily social rituals such as greeting others and the appropriate way of taking meals with them), and the feeling of approval/disapproval, which grows into *zhi* (wisdom, which includes the ability to identify the appropriate means to the appropriate ends in the various realms of life, including governing and advising rulers).

It is crucial to understanding Mencius that the sprouts be recognized *only* as the beginnings of virtue. They require nurturing through education, through the provision of opportunity for secure livelihood that will spare people the physical and psychic resources to develop their beginnings, and through the personal effort of each person to develop his or her beginnings. In Confucianism, that which confers dignity on the individual also confers responsibility on that same person to develop it. As indicated above, Mencius holds that a secure material livelihood and ethical education are conditions for moral development. In 1A7, he clearly holds King Xuan responsible for realizing these conditions for his people, and if he does not, Mencius says, there will be no dissoluteness, depravity, deviance, or excess to which people will not succumb (see also 6A7). Moreover, to punish them for crimes committed under these conditions is to entrap them.

The idea that the qualities conferring dignity also confer responsibility on their possessor to develop them is not highlighted in the western tradition, but it may appear eminently reasonable once one is confronted with it in the Confucian tradition. Furthermore, one cannot only fail to fulfill one's responsibility. One can neglect and abuse the moral sprouts so that they wither and die, and it will be as if they were never there in the first place (6A7–8). Such a person will be reduced to the condition of being on a par with animals and become unworthy of what one was given. Again, this idea does not seem to have been highlighted in the western tradition, but once posed, it can be hard to avoid its force.

But should the proper response to those who have abused their *duan* be the revocation of dignity for offenders, and where is the threshold that justifies such a severe response? There is no direct response to these hard questions in the Confucian tradition, and one reason for this is that the tradition spreads the responsibility to develop one's moral potentials to others. Both the self and others share responsibility to develop one's sprouts, and this is appropriate in a philosophy that emphasizes the relational nature of persons. One only becomes the person one is through the help, or lack of it, of others. Thus, one may deserve a great deal of blame for failing to develop one's moral potentials, but much of the time that blame will be shared with others.

In Buddhism, human beings are not fundamentally different from other sentient beings. In the karmic cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, a human being at one time may become or may have been an animal at another. In virtue of their capability for suffering, all sentient beings should be treated with compassion and loving kindness. What makes human beings special is their capability for awakening to the way the world is and the conventional reality of their selves. According to the Buddhist doctrine of "no-self" (in Pāli, *anattā*; in Sanskrit, *anātman*), there is no substantial self only a stream of mental-physical phenomena inextricably related to the other streams constituting sentient beings and to nonsentient beings as well. Awakening includes recognizing that one's self is merely conventionally real, that is, existing as an individual only when conceived as such in the way that the parts of a chariot are conceived by human beings as parts of a single thing, given the purposes they have in mind for it. Such an awakening leads to shedding attachment to the self, and most importantly, to be free of the suffering of the self (the *Milindapanha* "Questions of Milinda," question 1, approximately 100 bce; see also sermons of the Buddha, especially verse 7 of the *Dhammapada*, third century bce). One becomes free when one awakens to the conventionality of what makes one a distinct individual as opposed to others, and that makes the suffering of others equally important. That is why, in the Mahayana tradition, the highest ideal is not simply to liberate oneself from suffering and exit the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth to enter Nirvana, but to become a bodhisattva, one who has awakened but elects not to enter into nirvana until all others are released from their suffering (Śāntideva, *Śikṣā-samuccaya* 12, seventh–eighth centuries ce).

Insofar as dignity implies a substantial, nonconventional self or attaching importance to such a self, Buddhism does not support dignity. But insofar as equality and universality are part of the concept of dignity, Buddhism has the concept. A possible basis for a distinctively human kind of dignity lies in the distinctively human capability for awakening. However, this capability involves realizing that one's individuality is not as real or as important as one thought it was, and that this is the key to being free from the suffering that any being, human or animal, should be free from. This is not the basis for the kind of dignity arising from the western tradition.

Confucianism forthrightly asserts the special value of the individual, but that special value lies in one's capacity and responsibility to connect with others and to create a truly human and worthwhile life of relationship. Buddhism also asserts the special value of the individual, but only as a conventional individual, and that value lies in the ability to awaken to the conventionality of selves and the importance of freeing every sentient being from suffering. Those who see the tradition of western thinking about dignity as too closely associated with a fragmenting and hard-edged individualism or with an inflated and unsustainable view of humanity as the center of the universe will do well to look to these other traditions.

[^1]: Mencius seems to have originated the idea of moral sprouts in human nature.
[^2]: *Jing* as seriousness seems to predominate in the *Analects*, while in Mencius and Xunzi, *jing* turns more toward the meaning of an attitude one can take toward persons and other things that have worth.
[^3]: The similarity between this feature of Mencius's theory and modern moral sense theory as developed by Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith has not escaped some scholars. See, e.g., Alejandra Mancilla, "The Bridge of Benevolence: Hutcheson and Mencius," *Dao* 12 (2013): 57–72; David Morrow, "Moral Psychology and the 'Mencian Creature,'" *Philosophical Psychology* 22 (2009): 281– 304; and Bongrae Seok, *Embodied Moral Psychology and Confucian Moral Philosophy* (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012).
