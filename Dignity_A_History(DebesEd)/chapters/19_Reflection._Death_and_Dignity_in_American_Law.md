# *Reflection*: Death and Dignity in American Law 
*Emma Kaufman*

Dignity serves many purposes in American jurisprudence. Over the past century, courts in the United States have invoked the concept of dignity to limit intrusive searches by the police and to bar discrimination on account of race and gender.1 Dignity surfaces in discussions of sexual violence, marriage, citizenship, and the privacy of both the body and the home.2 Yet nowhere is this concept more vital than debates about the death penalty. In American law, dignity's most prominent role is to mediate the state's capacity to kill.

An account of the relationship between dignity and capital punishment requires some context. At present, the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world.3 Men of color are

The concept of dignity is more deeply entrenched in European law, where treaties explicitly prohibit incursions onto the dignity of the person. See, e.g., Article 75(2)(b) of the Geneva Conventions; see also James Whitman, "The Two Western Cultures of Privacy: Dignity versus Liberty," *Yale Law Journal* 113 (2004): 1151.

especially likely to be imprisoned. In 2008, black men were six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men of the same age, and today, close to one in three African American men will be incarcerated in his lifetime.4 The penal institutions in which these people are held, though varied, are notoriously harsh.

Like incarceration rates, the death penalty is related to structural inequities in wealth and power, and in particular, to race. In the now famous Baldus study, a group of social scientists found that defendants who murdered white victims were more than four times as likely to be sentenced to death as those who killed people of color.5 These numbers grow even more disproportionate when the defendant is black,6 and become especially sobering in a comparative frame. The United States is one of only 18 countries in the United Nations, a body composed of 193 member states, to use the death penalty. It is the only western country that permits the punishment of death.7

There was a time, not long ago, when capital punishment was illegal in the United States. In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment's

It is also important to note that the conditions in prisons, though brutal in many facilities, vary widely between institutions.

prohibition on "cruel and unusual" punishment.8 That case, *Furman v. Georgia*, established a moratorium on capital punishment that lasted four years.9 The *Furman* decision was fractured—no justice wholly endorsed another's reasoning—but in each concurrence, dignity did significant conceptual work. Justice William Brennan began his oft-cited opinion with a declaration: "The basic concept underlying the [ban on cruel and unusual punishment] is nothing less than the dignity of man."10 He went on to extract from this claim a set of rules about when punishment comports with the Constitution. First, the Justice argued, punishment that is too severe is "degrading to the dignity of human beings."11 Dignity also prohibits the "arbitrary infliction" of punishment and requires social acceptance for a sanction to be just.12 Finally, Justice Brennan wrote, punishment "must not be excessive," for it violates "human dignity" to impose one punishment when an adequate and more moderate alternative exists.13

Justice Brennan's voice was not the only one in *Furman v. Georgia*, but his reasoning reflects a key feature of dignity's treatment in the law. In this opinion, a moment when dignity did some of its heaviest lifting, the concept was less a quality of personhood than a principle of governance. Dignity is neither clearly defined nor especially tied to human nature in the Supreme

<sup>8 <</sup>i>Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). To be clear, several justices argued that the death penalty was always unconstitutional, while others held that it was unconstitutional as applied in practice in the United States.

<sup>9</sup> The de facto ban established by *Furman* ended with *Gregg v. Georgia*, in which the Court reversed course and held that capital punishment "comports with the basic concept of human dignity at the core of the [Eighth] Amendment." *Gregg v. Georgia*, 428 U.S. 153, 182 (1976).

Court's analysis of the death penalty. Instead, the term grounds a particular vision of political organization. Justice Brennan derived from dignity the values of moderation, democratic participation, and consistency in the application of law. His opinion, and others that have followed it, repeatedly stated that dignity requires "civilized" societies to constrain punishment.14 Justice Thurgood Marshall used similar diction, condemning the death penalty as a punishment inconsistent with "practices of other civilized nations of the world."15

In each of these texts, dignity is cited as an innate human quality, but employed for a different end—namely, to instantiate a relationship between a government and its citizenry. While capital punishment cases speak of persons bearing an inherent dignity, the project of these cases is to determine whether *the state* will act in a "dignified" manner. Dignity seems less inherent than constructed in this account, and the term encompasses the state as well as the individual. While Justices write of dignity as a human attribute, they use dignity to model a form of recognition between those in and subject to power. This is not "dignity" in its classic sense. In death penalty cases, dignity describes a dynamic between the subject and the state.

This approach to dignity, which centers on governance rather than human nature, displaces a more individuated account of the term. One consequence of using dignity to describe the behavior of governments is that individuals, and the bodies they inhabit, go curiously missing from legal analysis. Discussions of capital punishment are deeply embodied—the debate at issue is whether humans, confined in metal cages, should be electrocuted or drugged to death for violating the criminal code. Yet legal treatises

on dignity tend to obscure the physicality and affect of capital punishment, or at least to distinguish pain from dignitary harms. (See Fig. 11R1 and Fig. 11R2)

"Pain, certainly, may be a factor" in condemnation of the death penalty, Justice Brennan wrote in *Furman v. Georgia*. But "the pain involved" is not the source of capital punishment's indignity.16 Rather, "The true significance of these punishments is that they …. reflect the attitude that the person punished is not entitled to recognition as a fellow human being."17 This claim captures the relevance of recognition: in *Furman*, dignity is the status, conferred by law, of being acknowledged and respected by one's government. Justice Brennan's writing also highlights the tenuous but crucial relationship between bodies and legal sanctions. In legal writing on the death penalty, dignity translates the treatment of bodies into a normative vision of criminal justice. The concept of dignity turns killing or not killing a human into the measure of a polity's "civility."

This account raises questions about the exchange between dignity and governance. Does dignity exist in the absence of the law? Can it persist outside a political community? Does a relational notion of dignity enhance or undermine the treatment of individuals? These questions lie just below the surface of Supreme Court cases on capital punishment.18 The *Furman* decision was only a moment in time, and a fleeting one at that. But the opinion hints at a view of punishment in which dignity is a fundamentally relational concept, less a characteristic of personhood than a state of existing in dialogue with the law. This vision of dignity is more

<sup>18</sup> Jeremy Waldron and Meir Dan-Cohen, among others, have explored these questions about dignity's dependence on the law. See Meir Dan-Cohen, "Defending Dignity," in *Harmful Thoughts: Essays on Law, Self, and Morality* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002), 150–71; Jeremy Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, ed.

institutional, more community-based, and more alienable than conceptions that emphasize unwavering and individuated worth.19 Yet, if the law renders dignity more contingent, it also uses the term to advance an implicit critique of government. When dignity does its most compelling work, this concept serves to limit or license the flow of state power.

The contradiction, of course, is that dignity surfaces at precisely the points when the law is most harsh.20 One might ask what becomes of dignity when people—usually people with young, black bodies—continue to live in brutal carceral conditions and on "death rows."21 It may be that these people retain a quality that endures in the face of punishment, and that we ought to call that quality dignity. Alternatively, it could be that dignity is a relationship between people and polities, one that disappears when governments incarcerate and kill. This is the picture that emerges from death penalty jurisprudence. In *Furman v. Georgia*, dignity tracks the presence or absence of acknowledgment in a system of power. Dignity is a way to understand, to critique, and perhaps to change practices of recognition in societies that sentence people to death.
