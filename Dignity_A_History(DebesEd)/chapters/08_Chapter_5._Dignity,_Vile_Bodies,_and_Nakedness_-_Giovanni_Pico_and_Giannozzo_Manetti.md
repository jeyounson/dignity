# Chapter 5: Dignity, Vile Bodies, and Nakedness - Giovanni Pico and Giannozzo Manetti

*Brian Copenhaver*

## Manetti, Not Pico

In 1486 Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote a speech widely (though wrongly) seen as the leading statement of its day about human dignity. A striking feature of the speech is dislike of the body—"a noose round the neck of the soul." Several decades earlier, Giannozzo Manetti had written a longer work, also in Latin, that often mentions *dignitas* while treating the body in a strikingly different way. The body is "an amazingly elegant dwelling for the human soul" that proves mankind's superiority because the human frame is "worthier" (*dignior*) than any other animal's. Manetti also admired the human skill and spirit that he saw displayed in the magnificent art of his hometown—Florence. While never attributing *dignitas* to anything artificial, he shows how art dazzles him as a distinctively human achievement: art is "energetic,"

"outstanding," and "astonishing." As for Manetti's own achievement, I will show how remarkable it was in its own cultural and moral setting—especially by contrast to Pico's revulsion for the body.

## Kant's Dignity and Adam's

In the third *Critique*, speaking of fine art, Immanuel Kant concludes this about its products, which often are inert, lifeless things: a work of art "must in itself always show some dignity (*Würde*)." Some years before, however, in a famous passage of the *Groundwork*, the same philosopher had ruled that possibility out by restricting dignity to humans and the moral law. In the kingdom of ends where humans act rationally—as when they evaluate works of art—"everything has either a price (*Preis*) or a dignity." Things with prices have equivalents that can replace them, whereas dignity belongs to what is beyond price and has no equivalent. The absolutely incomparable and utterly irreplaceable ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (See Fig. 5.1), perhaps?2

Price and dignity are types of value (*Wert*). Price, whether calculated by needs in a market or driven by whims in a carnival of delight, is relative value. Dignity is intrinsic value, possessed only by "morality and by humanity insofar as it is morally capable"—morality enforced by a system of laws, legislated by humans. Outside the kingdom of ends, both nature and art are effective, producing things whose value is relative. Within the kingdom of ends, however, the salient item is no thing at all but "a mentality recognized as dignity, … an unconditional, incomparable value."3

<sup>2</sup> Drama and music are not lifeless in performance, of course, like scores and scripts. I cite Kant's text in the Suhrkamp series, using or adapting the English of the Guyer and Wood edition: *Kritik der Urteilskraft*, ed. W. Weischedel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1974), 277; *Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten*, ed. W. Weischedel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1974), 68–69; *Critique of the Power of Judgment*, ed. and trans. P. Guyer and E. Matthews (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 212; *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*, in *Practical Philosophy*, ed. and trans. M. Gregor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 84–85.

<sup>3</sup> Kant, *Grundlegung*, 68–69; *Groundwork*, 84–85.

How to bring this item into focus? One index is the respect that each rational being owes to every other, according to the *Metaphysics of Morals*: "not merely as a means to ends, … but as an end in itself, … he possesses a dignity (an absolute inner value)." Hence, "a human being regarded as a person … is raised above any price … and possesses an inalienable dignity (*dignitas interna*)." It is this inner dignity that commands from other persons the respect that no one may forfeit respect not just for "a person generally but as a human." Such a person has "duties that his own reason lays upon him," by the self-legislating that constitutes both human personhood and dignity, so that the one always comes with the other, inseparably.4

If so, if dignity is inalienable, why should Kant warn against *forfeiting* respect? Why is self-esteem a duty, since duties can go *undone*? Why worry about the servility that *disavows* dignity or the ambition that seeks "an even greater inner value"? Perhaps respect, servility, and ambition are all relational—relating persons to things or each other by attitude or desire—and perhaps self-esteem is reflexive, turning the relation of respect back on the self, whereas dignity is not reflexive or relational, but constitutive (in part) of the human person. Perhaps "greater inner value" is incoherent since any measure of increase must be by a standard, relating the unrelatable. The questions are hard, and Kant does not settle them all.5

He says that the moral law itself has dignity, as do humans as its legislators. But laws on the books are made by humans, not the reverse. Laws, rules, maxims, and other such items would seem to get their dignity from the humans who enact them. Dignity belongs to persons, not to things, natural or artificial, whose values are relative, not entirely their own. Impersonal things lack the absolute, unconditional, incomparable value that belongs—and belongs inalienably—to each human

person. But a work of art needs to show some dignity. So what might Kant mean?

A work of artifice or art is an artificial thing—not a person. In some sense, practical or poetic, Michelangelo's ceiling may be incomparably valuable, but the value cannot be absolute. Tastes may change and horrify us all. The Vatican might sell the Chapel and its ceiling. The unthinkable commerce, as such, would violate no person's dignity: Adam, God, and the rest of that lofty crowd are not persons just pictures of persons. Pictures can be bought and sold.

Perhaps the subtle economy of value, price, and dignity can bear some strain, however: if a work of art—Adam naked on the ceiling— "must in itself always show some dignity," maybe Kant equivocates a bit about 'dignity' or is more intent on the showing (*zeigen*) of it. The lifeless image just seems to have that feature because it seems alive on the ceiling. The painted Adam can "show some dignity" because it looks like a human person.6

## Pico's Dignity

Kant connected *Würde*, his word for dignity, with *dignitas* in Latin. Wilhelm Tennemann did the same when he adapted Jacob Brucker's earlier history of philosophy to Kant's new ideas and terminology, in order to explicate a much older speech, called the *Oratio de hominis dignitate*—though not called that by its author, Pico. Written in 1486, the *Oration* was not yet as famous as Pico when Tennemann noticed it. He and other historians put the speech on its path to fame, but only at the end of the Enlightenment.7

<sup>7</sup> For Tennemann on Pico, much more positive than Brucker, see Copenhaver, "Magic and the Dignity of Man," in *The Italian Renaissance in the Twentieth Century: Acts of an International Conference in Florence, Villa I Tatti, June 9–11, 1999*, ed. A. Grieco et al. (Florence: Villa I Tatti, 2002), 295–320; on the missing title and circumstances of publication, see Bausi's introduction in Pico, *Discorso sulla dignità dell'uomo*, ed. and trans. F. Bausi (Parma: Guanda, 2003), xi, and for details Copenhaver, "Giovanni Pico della Mirandola," *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Fall 2016 ed.), ed. Edward N. Zalta.

Pico had planned the *Oration* to introduce an overblown event that never happened, severely damaging his reputation. Meant to dazzle the College of Cardinals, the speech introduces a longer text—900 philosophical theses, some in paradoxical form—that provoked papal condemnation, forcing Pico to run away to France. Had the young prince not been so well connected, the calamity might have been fatal. He survived but never published the *Oration* and seems to have been embarrassed by it. In any case, because the speech relies on coded Jewish secrets, the intended audience of Christian dignitaries could never have grasped what it says—that humans must escape the body and turn into angels, using magic and Kabbalah.8

Much later, the *Oration* would entrance students and their teachers in North America. After World War II, as colleges rapidly expanded, they needed textbooks for courses on 'western civilization.' One was a book of readings published in 1948, a key year for Pico's story: called *The Renaissance Philosophy of Man* and still in print, it includes an English version of the speech—rarely translated before the twentieth century. *The Western Heritage* (1979), a textbook typical of its time, reprints a few lines. In them Pico imagines God clarifying the terms of creation for Adam: "To him it is granted to have whatever he chooses, to be whatever he wills." A boxed headline introduces the passage:

## Pico della Mirandola States the Renaissance Image of Man

One of the most eloquent descriptions of the Renaissance image of man comes from the Italian humanist Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494). In his famed *Oration on the Dignity of Man* (c. 1486) Pico describes man as free to become whatever he chooses.

In the next (1983) edition of *The Western Heritage,* Pico's topic becomes "the Renaissance image of *mankind*," and what he describes is "*humans* as free to become whatever *they* choose." In the 1995 edition, "mankind" has evolved again into "human beings," and the updated praise of humanity has provoked interrogation. "How great, really, is the choice outlined here," we are asked. "Is the concept of freedom in this passage a modern one?"9

In 1999, another book—*Western Civilization: A Brief History* displayed the same part of the *Oration* in the same way, with Pico proclaiming "the unlimited potentiality of human beings." By the end of the last century, the speech had become a meme. Pico was now a fixture in textbooks meant to explain world history or western civilization or the Renaissance to college students. Praise for him was abundant, expressed in a flamboyant vocabulary: "bold," "exuberant," "striking," "dazzling," "brilliant," "gargantuan," "remarkable," "renowned," "outstanding." His *Oration* is "immortal," the "most famous Renaissance statement on the nature of man," and the "supreme statement of the Renaissance idolization of man."10

Ever since Tennemann, however, few readers of Pico's speech had read far enough. His exordium, a short blast of studied rhetoric, does indeed rewrite the biblical script for God, permitting Adam "to have what he chooses, to be what he wants." What the first human *ought* to choose, however, is not at all human—a lesson that comes after the opening of the speech.11

Pico's eventual advice is nothing like the usual textbook accounts of the *Oration*; only an extended selection can show the difference:

Let us climb for the heights, panting; and let us strive with all our might to reach them—since we can do it if we will it. Let us scorn the things of earth, let us despise those of heaven, and then, leaving behind whatever belongs to the world, let us fly up to the hypercosmic court nearest the most exalted divinity, where … seraphim, cherubim, and thrones have the first places. Since we cannot abide second place and cannot yield to them, let us be their rivals for rank (*dignitas*) and glory…. We are to form our lives on the model of the cherubic life…. Because we are flesh and smell of the earth, however, we cannot attain this on our own, so let us go to the ancient fathers…. Emulating the cherubic life on earth, … let us consult the patriarch Jacob…. He will use a figure, … a ladder reaching from earth below to the sky above, … with the Lord seated at the top, while back and forth the angels of contemplation "move up and down the ladder." But if we are to do the same as we aspire to the angelic life, who—I ask—will touch the Lord's ladder with dirty feet or hands unclean?

<sup>11</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 12.

"For the impure to touch the pure is sacrilege," as the mysteries teach…. These hands, these feet—the whole sensual part where the lure of the body "hangs, as they say, like a noose round the neck of the soul"—let us wash them … , lest we be turned away from the ladder, desecrated and defiled…. Then, animated by the cherubic spirit, … resting at the top of the ladder in the bosom of the Father, we shall at last be consumed in theological bliss…. We will enjoy to the full the peace that we have longed for—the holiest peace, the unbreakable bond, the friendship of the single-souled wherein all our spirits do not so much converge in the one mind that is above every mind as in some unsayable way emerge as absolutely one. This is the friendship that the Pythagoreans say is the end of all philosophy. This is the peace that God "makes on high," which angels descending to earth have announced "to men of goodwill" so that through it these same men, ascending to heaven, might be made into angels.12

Pico wants humans to become angels, and the rest of the *Oration* tells them how. The speech is an exhortation to do angel magic, using Kabbalist techniques of ecstatic transformation to become "absolutely one" with God, thus consuming the self "in theological bliss." Scriptural quotations punctuating the speech are clues for the few who could see them for what they are—allusions to texts of Kabbalah that no Christians of Pico's day could possibly understand. Writing so learnedly at the age of twenty-three about material so arcane, the young prince was full of himself—blind to the arrogance that kept readers of the *Oration* baffled for five centuries, until just a few decades ago. Certainly Tennemann was in no position to understand what Pico was talking about.13

What the speech says about *dignitas* is easy to see, however, since the word comes up only twice. When Pico first uses it—in the passage just cited—*dignitas* is paired with *gloria* as a prize held by angels,

<sup>12</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 22–42.

<sup>13</sup> Wirszubski, *Encounter*; Copenhaver, "Secret of Pico's *Oration*"; Copenhaver, "Maimonides, Abulafia and Pico."

not humans. It denotes angelic *rank*, higher than human but nonetheless comparable, while connoting other senses of this slippery word. *Dignitas* in its second use describes the philosophical preparation that precedes the esoteric part of his curriculum. The pairing here of *dignitas* with *emolumenta* ("advantages") also makes this instance of the word, denoting the *value* of philosophy, a comparative and relative term. In neither case does *dignitas* belong to humans, except aspirationally, and neither justifies 'dignity' as a translation, with all the Kantian baggage of the modern English word. As for the speech as a whole, Pico never bothered to give it a title. *Oration on the Dignity of Man* has stuck, however, once an early editor jumped to conclusions from a glance at the first few pages.14

This was the title known to Tennemann, who misread the speech in the same way—at least the first few paragraphs that seemed readable. Turning the *Oration*'s ideas into German, he had many more options than *Würde*, however. Perhaps he remembered where the *Metaphysics of Morals* links *Würde* with *dignitas*—or perhaps not. One dictionary available to him since 1779, Scheller's *Complete Latin-German Lexicon*, gives these choices in addition to *Würde*:

| Ansehen | reputation |
| --- | --- |
| Anstand | decency |
| Ehrbarkeit | integrity |
| Ehre | prestige |
| Ehrenstelle | post of honor |
| Schicklichkeit | propriety |
| Schönheit | beauty |
| Stand | rank |
| Tugend | virtue |
| Verdienst | merit |
| Werth | value |
| Wohlstand | prosperity |
| Würde | dignity |
| Würdigkeit | worthiness |

<sup>14</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 22; note 7 in this chapter.

Some of the German words overlap, and each has its own wider range, reflecting the breadth and complexity in classical Latin of *dignitas*, whose meaning varied with context and over time. A later work completed in 1845, Freund's *Dictionary of the Latin Language*, is tidier than Scheller's *Lexicon*, classifying senses of *dignitas* in three groups: "original," "by metonymy of cause for effect," and "figurative." The basic meanings are rare, says Freund, perhaps found only in Cicero: "worth (*Würdigsein*), worthiness (*Würdigkeit*), and merit." Metonymies are frequent: "the dignity (*Würde*), reputation, respect or high standing that arises from the physical or moral features of a person or the state." The word also applies "figuratively to physical objects for value, dignity (*Würde*) or distinction."15

Tennemann had many options, then. But only two—*Wert* and *Würde*—would insert Pico's *dignitas*, alongside *Preis*, into Kant's elegant moral calculus. For Pico's fame and the celebrity of his *Oration*, the choice of *Würde* was decisive. Yet nothing calls for it in the speech that Pico wrote, which reveals little of the author's thinking about *dignitas*.

Nonetheless, appeals to Pico's missing account of dignity are commonplace (not to say habitual and formulaic) in the contemporary literature on the subject. There, as in writings of the previous two centuries, the full-blown notion is sometimes "human freedom and dignity," whose nexus is taken to be characteristic of modernity. The modern world itself, by other widespread accounts, was also the invention of Pico's era, the 'Renaissance,' as described most powerfully by Jacob Burckhardt and more gracefully by Walter Pater: Pico's speech and Adam's body (See Fig. 5.2) are moments of modernity for Pater.16

"This high dignity of man" is Pater's phrase—making too much, as usual, of the *Oration*'s mistaken title. The word 'dignity' itself, without reference to the speech's conflicting content, signaled to him "a counterpoise to the increasing tendency of medieval religion to depreciate man's nature, … to make it ashamed of itself…. It helped man onward to that … rehabilitation of human nature, the body, the senses, the heart, the intelligence, which the Renaissance fulfills." Likewise, but on far better evidence of the eyes, Michelangelo's genius was

to concern itself almost exclusively with the making of man, … the first and unique act, the creation of life itself in its supreme form…. Fair as the young men of the Elgin marbles, the Adam of the Sistine Chapel is unlike them…. In that languid figure there is something rude and satyr-like…. His whole form is gathered into an expression of mere expectancy and reception; he has hardly strength enough to lift his finger to touch the finger of the creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.

And so it did suffice. This huge, dreamy, muscle-bound Bacchus has, within himself, what it takes to make the heavenly connection and become a god on earth. The Creator floats above Adam, but a creature steals the show. Almighty God, with a crowd stirring under his cloak, is more than just scenery, but not much more. One might ask

just who is made in whose likeness. Rehabilitation is no longer the issue for Adam's nature, mind, heart, senses, or body. The high dignity of man exhibits itself in them—up there, on display in Adam's nakedness.17

Since Kant thought that a work of art must show some dignity, could he allow as much about this painted Adam, a picture of the first human, while confining dignity to mankind and the moral law? Perhaps he could find a way, true to his own words about art and dignity. But what about Pico and his angel magic—those "symbols of the Jewish ritual," as Pater called them?18

Kant mentions Pico only once, as "one of the prodigies of memory … who carry around in their heads … a load of books for a hundred camels … [and] perhaps lacked the … judgment suitable for choosing." The camels suggest the many stories about the young prince who knew everything, but there are no complaints about magic or Kabbalah. Yet Kant might have agreed with another enlightened sage, Voltaire, who eviscerated Pico for "benighted erudition," "unintelligible words," and "alarming lunacy" in "a vast pit of error." Kant knew where to put such craziness, with the "rapture (*Schwärmerei*) that deludes itself by hoping to see beyond all limits of sense, a dreaming by principles or raving with reason."19

In any case, neither the *Oration* nor what it introduces has any bearing on Kant's theory of dignity, despite Tennemann's views on Pico's *dignitas* as *Würde*. But Kant's theory of *Würde* is the root of modern conceptions of dignity, whose outstanding official expression is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. The Declaration recognizes dignity as inherent in "all members of the human family" and links it

with "inalienable rights" as "the foundation of freedom." If Pico were really the author of a text that anticipates this conception of human dignity, he would deserve our attention and admiration as an architect of modernity. But he wrote nothing like it.20

## Manetti's Dignity I

So should we skip Pico's era, the Renaissance, as we track dignity through the ages? Not yet, because other texts from the same period say more about *dignitas*. One is Manetti's longer work *On the Dignity and Excellence of Man*. 21

The book's circumstances reveal its intent: it emulates an earlier, shorter work, *On Man's Excellence and Superiority*, written in the late 1440s by Bartolomeo Facio and dedicated to Nicholas V, who became pope in 1447. Facio had been Genoa's ambassador to Alfonso V of Aragon, the king of Naples, who supported a large clientele of scholars, Facio among them, but also Manetti, who would already have met Facio when he represented Florence in Genoa, then again later when Florence sent him to Naples in 1443 and to Rome when Nicholas was elected. The new pontiff knew Manetti well; they had studied together in Florence. And the Florentine had already seen Facio's book in Naples, describing it to Alfonso, in his fulsome way, as "excellent, outstanding, worth remembering and deserving much praise besides." If a

<sup>20</sup> The UN posts the Declaration on its website, along with a page for the nine "drafters," at http:// www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/index.html.

<sup>21</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate*, is the standard edition, edited by Elizabeth Leonard. For Manetti's life and works, see Simona Foà, "Manetti Gianozzo," *Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani*, http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giannozzo-manetti; Charles Trinkaus, *In Our Image and Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Thought* (London: Constable, 1970), 1.230–58. Since *dignitas* is not always well rendered by 'dignity,' I often use the Latin word instead of the English.

pope had so fine a book, a king should have one too: so Manetti wrote another on the same subject.22

He finished in 1450 or 1451, when he was back in Tuscany. The book is larger than Facio's and painfully well organized, as if by someone who has just discovered topic sentences. On the concept of dignity, however, there is not much to choose between the two. This is strange, since one of them, Manetti's, is the only finished piece of Latin prose from the period on *dignitas* that declares itself to be so—except for Pico's mistitled speech. If, from an age renowned for 'humanism,' Manetti's is the most prominent account of *dignitas* whose title actually claims that role, one might expect more of it.

A respected survey of the canonical texts includes Manetti's but credits Petrarch with "the first explicit treatment of the theme of the 'dignity of man.'" Petrarch's subject was larger, however— *Remedies for Both Kinds of Fortune*, where *dignitas* comes up briefly in a chapter titled "Sadness and Misery," sandwiched between toothache and the plague. Nearly ninety years passed before Friar Antonio da Barga tested the same theme in a sketch, *On Human Dignity*, prompting Facio—Antonio's student—and perhaps Manetti to enter the conversation. Then Poggio Bracciolini turned the tables in 1455 with *Two Books on the Misery of the Human Condition*. Giovanni Garzoni also wrote a work called *On Human Misery*, while *Human Happiness* was Benedetto Morandi's topic. After Platina (Bartolommeo de' Sacchi) discussed the topics in his title, *The True and False Good*, in the 1470s, Aurelio Brandolini, his student, followed with a *Dialogue on the State of Human Life and the Need to Bear the Body's Ills*. 23

All in all, illness and misery did as well as health and happiness in this period, and *dignitas* was on nobody's marquee—except Manetti's. But making too much of titles in the Quattrocento would be a mistake; manuscript publication, unstable in such matters, was the norm until late in the century. Still, in the tale of dignity, much has been made of a title that Pico never gave his speech, where *dignitas* occurs just twice and the human type never. Manetti's book, whatever its flaws, has at least the virtue of using the Latin word often—more than ten times as often as Pico.24

Writing about human excellence presented many occasions for mentioning *dignitas*. Perhaps too many: the book is egregiously overwritten. Every paragraph comes fully padded. Explicit outlining and signposting are relentless. No rhetorical figure of repetition goes unrepeated: commoratio, hendiatris, synathroesmus, synonymia, and tautology are staples for Manetti. Pleonasms are everywhere, as in his nod to Facio's shorter effort: "excellent, outstanding, worth remembering and deserving much praise besides." Besides? For this way of writing, duplication, triplication, and beyond are elements of style: Strunk and White would have baffled Manetti. But carping at bloated writing in a dead language would have little point were the wordiness not a remedy—possibly—for vagueness on the nature of dignity.25

When Kant claims that dignity cannot be taken from any human and cannot be priced, he gives reasons for what he thinks. From his reasoning, a definition can be derived: according to one expert, Kant's dignity is "the absolute, hence equal, worth of all rational beings." But Manetti's way is not to state a definition or justify its elements; he keeps talking about *dignitas* without ever saying what it is. How can we find

out? Pleonasms may help, as in the title of his book: *On the Dignity and Excellence of Man*. After a few pages, anyone can see that this pairing of *dignitas* with *excellentia* is nothing unusual. It's a formula, a habit, a tic in Manetti's Latin.26

In the first lines of the book, in a space of 200 words, I count nine pleonasms, involving 29 words. Later, other pairings pop up everywhere, like *plane et aperte* (plainly and clearly), used three dozen times. Dreary repetition shows this coupling to be empty: the second partner never changes anything about the first—no gain, no loss. This is not always so, however. Consider *certa ac vera* (certain and true). As presented, this marriage is also childless, though it might be otherwise: truth and certainty are not the same, after all. Or take *animum mentemque* (spirit and mind). As Manetti notes, experts could not decide whether an *animus* was always an *anima*, sometimes reserving the latter for 'soul,' the former for 'mind.' Glossing *animus* with *mens* might be informative, then. Suppose this were so for the *dignitate et excellentia* in Manetti's title: he would be informing us about *dignitas* by pairing it with *excellentia*. Wordiness about *dignitas* may help us learn what he thought about it.27

That little bit of rhetoric and philology is purely lexical, but it bears on philosophy. Another side of philology, the study of ancient texts, does the same. Manetti wrote and spoke Latin fluently, but it was not his maternal language. Much of his vocabulary came from the old texts, whose recovery from medieval oblivion was momentous for him and his peers. In reality, many Latin classics had never dropped out of sight during the

<sup>27</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate,* pr. 1: *amor ac benevolentia* (love and friendship); *inductus et quasi compulsus* (persuaded and almost compelled); *affatim abundeque* (bountifully and abundantly); *dignissima et admirabili* (most worthy and admirable); *diligenter et accurate* (attentively and carefully); *late copioseque* (at length and in detail); *certa ac vera* (certain and true); *singulares ac vere admirabiles et paene divinas* (matchless, truly admirable, and nearly divine); *animum mentemque* (spirit and mind). The first few cases of *plane et aperte* are at 1.44, 54; 2.10, 12, 15—and then on and on, sometimes with *clare et aperte* as a variant. The *animus/anima* question comes up at 2.3.

Middle Ages: almost all that survived had been copied during that time. Nonetheless, when Petrarch found books by Cicero and Livy that had long gone unread, the shock of the new was electric, inspiring scholars like Manetti to revere the ancient texts, study them closely, and even learn them by heart. If Cicero had much to say about *dignitas*, Manetti would have known it.

## Cicero's Dignity

Cicero said a great deal—over a thousand uses of *dignitas*, half the total for classical Latin. In his lifetime, when the Republic collapsed, the politics of a crumbling state shaped the word. Because he used it so often to make political points, and because he was a lord of Latinity for people like Manetti, Cicero's usage—political and opportunist at its core—was the textual center of gravity for Manetti's *dignitas*. Cicero does not always use it in the same way, of course—not opportune for a politician. His speeches show us *dignitas* in practice. For theory we have essays on oratory as well as philosophical writings. His many letters shed light on all facets of the word.28

In 63 bce, Cicero was elected consul, but within a few years Rome's ferocious politics forced him into exile. In 57, events turned in his favor

and he returned to Rome, only to see his career implode. Before that humiliation, he spoke on behalf of an ally, Lucius Publius Sestius, and he got him off, presenting Sestius as a hero who would give his life for Rome—"a state with such resources, an empire of such *dignitas*."29

To get the judges on his client's side, Cicero insists that they, just like Sestius, are 'good' people (*boni*)—the very best (*optimi*), in fact. But Sestius had been framed by the faction called 'popular' (*populares*). Their opponents, including Cicero, were the *optimates*. Cicero broadens his base, however, arguing that his party is not an aristocratic clique: "all are optimates who are not criminals or perverts by nature or insane." He casts a wide net but quickly pulls it tight: the best people must also be "well off in domestic circumstances." Only those with wealth and property can afford the civic engagement that he takes for granted.

What do Cicero and the optimates want? "Peace with dignity"—in one standard translation, or "ease conjoined with duty" or "easy dignity." The Latin is *cum dignitate otium*, and it has puzzled the experts, who worry mainly about *otium*. If *dignitas* is 'easy,' for example, *otium* is *sprezzatura*, too nonchalant for earnest judges. 'Leisure' might be attractive, but could they afford it, and might it not be decadent? More seemly would be 'tranquility,' suggesting *ataraxia*, a moral ideal of the Greek sages whom Cicero followed.30

Under any description of *otium, dignitas* is the desired complement, but not just any *otium* will do, nor just any *dignitas*: "It befits no one," Cicero warns, "to be so transported by the *dignitas* of public deeds as to pay no mind to tranquility." Civic duty is done best by a sage capable of serenity: that was Cicero's ideal. He was a politician, however, and in that practical employment *cum dignitate otium* was a slogan, like "morning again in America" or "compassionate conservatism."31

Cicero's rivals eventually drove him out of Rome. Reflecting on those troubles, he says that exile deprived him of his "former *dignitas*" but that returning from the wilderness restored it. *Dignitas* comes and goes. The realpolitik of Cicero's responses to his dicey world is stunning. Reviewing his career, he concluded that

always sticking with a single position has never won praise for leaders who govern the state…. Although all of us—as I have said so often—should always aim at *dignitas* with tranquility, our obligation is to keep our goal the same, not to say the same thing.

No matter what, *otium* and *dignitas* need one another, whatever they happen to be called. Versatility in speech was a skill of Cicero's trade. An orator needs a moral compass, however, requiring good character, not just clever language. Accordingly, "Nothing is more desirable than *dignitas*" when speaking in public. And talk about virtue always sells. Wisdom, for example, will appeal to an audience as a shield against misfortune, a way to "hold on to *dignitas* when things get rough."32

A good man gets credit for not being broken by adversity and thus maintaining his stature, which Cicero—by his own account—could not manage. Perhaps what comes and goes is tied to office or current affairs, a contingency of status, while a different *dignitas* is a character trait that survives bad times, or even prospers. In light of that distinction, Cicero must have yet another *dignitas* in mind when he describes the fifth part of rhetoric, the delivery of a speech, as needing both *dignitas* and *venustas*. Just as *dignitas* goes with *otium* in politics, in rhetoric—and wherever aesthetic judgments apply—its companion is *venustas*. 33

When speech is art, the speaker pleases and persuades by choosing among elements of style. But the skilled orator knows that nature

is the mother of art: she has arranged things—items in the world reflected by items of language—so that "what has the most usefulness (*utilitas*) in it is the same thing that has the most dignity (*dignitas*) and often beauty (*venustas*) as well." This decorous *utilitas* is not expedient, and the associated *dignitas* is not dissolved by convenient choices. Moreover, the *venustas* linked with oratorical *dignitas* is no trivial beauty: we see it in the heavens, the human body, and in great works of art and artifice.34

Such monuments have grace (*decorum*), like the fitness of a temple whose parts fit one another and which fits the place where it stands. The columns holding the temple up are useful, and the pediment above is no mere decoration: "The temple's *dignitas* results from the *utilitas* of its pediment." Private houses also have such qualities. Cicero had thought about them, having lost his own house on the Palatine to exile. Another house on the same hill is "full of *dignitas*," a political asset for the owner: "In fact, *dignitas* can be supplied by a house, though not wholly obtained from it." The *dignitas* that can be had from a building can also be watched in a face, a body, a posture and gestures—all tools of the orator. Cicero has much to say about this bodily *dignitas* in his most important statement of moral theory, *On Duties*, which pairs it with *venustas*. The two are "types of beauty." *Dignitas* is male beauty, *venustas* is female: grace, charm, elegance, loveliness, comeliness.35

Cicero is not thinking just about inner beauty. The *dignitas* that goes with *venustas* as a feature of bodies and buildings is on display. He analyzes it by Romanizing Stoic ethics, starting with *kathēkon* or 'appropriate action.' He Latinized the Greek word as *officium* or 'duty,' a narrower term in his language. He also takes a novel approach to the usual four virtues. Instead of the elusive *sophrosunē*—often

'temperance,' though hard to render—his fourth is *to prepon* or *decorum* in Latin, what is seemly or fitting.36

The fit can be abstract, like *dignus*, a cousin of *dignitas. Dignus* is an adjective, 'worth' or 'worthy,' as in this noncommittal disjunction: 'worth seeking' or 'worth avoiding,' where for *any* content, one phrase cancels the other. Latin words of this family connote what can be judged aesthetically. Experts on etymology trace *decorum, dignitas*, and *dignus* to *decet*, an impersonal verb that glides from aesthetic to moral values when something 'is becoming.' If a thing 'is comely' another sense of *decet*—it has a body. Not if it 'is seemly,' however, and not necessarily if it 'is becoming.'37

It becomes a good person to follow nature. The sage who does his natural duty will realize "how far human nature surpasses the cattle and other animals who feel nothing but pleasure, … whereas the human mind feeds on learning and thinking, … directed by the delight of seeing and hearing." When people lapse into sensuality, they are ashamed, showing that "the body's pleasure does not really befit mankind's superiority…. If we choose to consider what excellence and *dignitas* there is in our nature, we will understand how disgraceful it is to ooze away in dissipation."38

This passage from Cicero's study of duties has been called "the earliest evidence in Latin for the dignity of human nature," and maybe it is.39 Nonetheless, his *dignitas* is a many-splendored thing, sometimes as banal as the lyrics of a pop song. In high-minded tones, Marcus the philosopher theorized about it, but theory never hobbled Tully the politician, who used the word just as he pleased. Cheapened by Roman politics, *dignitas* still always expressed value, but its core was

pragmatic and political, with allowances for social, moral, rhetorical, and aesthetic needs. Status, office, rank, and socioeconomic resources were often in play. The values in question were usually human, belonging to a single person. But groups of humans (the state, an audience) as well as nonhuman things (the universe, a building, a speech) could also have *dignitas*, whether they were natural (a tree) or artificial (a temple).

When the judgments were aesthetic, not all humans could have *dignitas*, however, which in that case was gendered: a handsome man's *dignitas* is *venustas* in a woman. When the stakes were political, male *dignitas* required *otium*, excluding all women and children and most men too—all the enslaved and almost all others, who, even if they were citizens, could not afford the civic involvement that Cicero expected. The few free adult males who could pay the price for *dignitas* might lose it and then regain it: it was transitory, circumstantial, and not inalienable. Its features are hard to pin down: external or internal, visible or invisible, material or immaterial, physical or psychological, bodily or nonbodily? It depends on the situation.

## Christian Dignity

Did a sordid past in Roman politics take *dignitas* off the table for some early Christians who spoke Latin? That might help explain why the word never occurs in the Latin New Testament, which uses many words like it—abstract nouns ending in -*itas*—especially for theological purposes in the Epistles. Besides 'love' (*caritas*) and 'truth' (*veritas*), which are everywhere, many other such abstractions entered the Holy Writ that bypassed *dignitas*: the new Christian *utilitas*, for example, is the kind that Cicero discussed, though the *tranquillitas* in the Gospels is good weather, not moral poise.40

<sup>40</sup> In the NT Vulg., see 1 Tim. 6:10 for 'avarice' (*cupiditas*); Eph. 5:4 for 'buffoonery' (*scurrilitas*); Mark 4:39 'calm' (*tranquillitas*); Rom. 1:20 'divinity' (*divinitas*); 2 Cor. 8:14 'equality' (*aequalitas*); 2 Cor. 4:7 'excellence' (*sublimitas*); Gal. 5:22 'forbearance' (*longanimitas*); Luke 2:9 'glory' (*claritas*); Rom. 2:4 'goodness' (*benignitas*); John 11:4 'illness' (*infirmitas*); Matt. 24:12 'iniquity' (*iniquitas*); Rom. 3:3 'unbelief ' (*incredulitas*); Rom. 3:16 'unhappiness' (*infelicitas*); Rom. 3:1 'usefulness' (*utilitas*).

In the Bible's distinctly Christian part, *dignitas* has no pedigree at all, and very little in the older books: of thirteen uses there, six are in apocryphal writings. Since scripture is nearly a blank slate for *dignitas*, the first Christians could make of it what they would. That something would be made of it was likely, since the word was so common in Latin. And because Christianity is a bookish religion, the Bible was bound to play a large role—despite its reticence.41

The holy book alone, in fact, since it framed all Christian experience, would make Christian *dignitas* different from the pagan kind known to Cicero. A few words (not including *dignitas*) from the opening of the Bible were especially productive: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." That passage from Genesis 1:26 inspired this early medieval meditation—probably by Alcuin around the year 800:  

We recognize the *dignitas* of the human condition to be so great that man was created not only by the words of the one giving the orders—like the works of the other six days—but by the will of the blessed Trinity and by an act of divine lordliness, so that man would understand from the honor of his original condition how much he owes his Creator, in keeping with the privilege that the Creator bestowed on him in his original state of *dignitas*…. Also, there is another trinity in man's soul, which was created in the image of its Creator—the supreme and perfect Trinity, in fact, which is in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And while the soul has a single nature, yet it has three *dignitates* in it: intellect, will and memory, … not three souls in one body, but a single soul having three *dignitates*. In those three, our inner person miraculously carries God's image in his

<sup>41</sup> OT Vulg. Passages with *dignitas* are Esth. 9:3, 10:2; Ezek. 24:25; Prov. 14:28, 16:31, 20:29; Eccles. 10:6; Ecclus. 44:3, 45:30; Bar. 4:3; 1 Mac. 10:24, 55; 3 Ezra 8:3.

own nature, and from them—as if from the soul's more outstanding *dignitates*—we are commanded to love the Creator….

What greater honor could a human have than to be created in the likeness of his maker? … Or what could disgrace a person more, what unhappiness could be more miserable, than to lose the glory of his Creator's likeness and sink into ugliness and absence of reason, the likeness of brute beasts? … Hence, whoever takes careful note of the excellence (*excellentia*) of his original condition and recognizes in himself the venerable image (*imago*) of the blessed Trinity, let him strive—by better behavior, by practicing the virtues, by the *dignitas* that comes with merit—also to have the honor (*honor*) of the divine likeness (*similitudo*) in which he has been created, so that when this appears as it is, he may appear like the one who by a miracle created him, in the first Adam, in his own likeness, and then, in the second Adam, gave him new form by a greater miracle.42

Since there is nothing political here and only a little morality, the author has come a long way from Cicero. He comments on a string of Bible verses, starting with Genesis. Humans, endowed with the primal excellence that mirrors the Creator's *image*, can also win the *dignitas* that "comes with merit," gaining the honor of the divine *likeness* by virtuous behavior: *excellentia* is inborn, but *honor* is earned by the *dignitas* of meritorious conduct. Honor has its counterpoint in disgrace, however—the price of forgetting the divine likeness and reverting to beastly ugliness. Humans can lose their resemblance to God. To avoid that shame, they must constantly imitate the Creator who gave them his own image.

But God in this persona (as distinct from Christ) is bodiless and invisible. How can embodied humans have a bodiless Creator's

<sup>42 <</sup>i>Dicta Albini de imagine Dei, in John Marenbon, *From the Circle of Alcuin to the School of Auxerre: Logic and Philosophy in the Early Middle Ages* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 33, 43, 158–61: as Marenbon explains, Albinus was Alcuin's nickname.

likeness? The answer lies in the parts or powers or faculties of the soul. According to Augustine, the human soul has many tripartitions. One of them is intellect, will, and memory—as in the short treatise on the human condition. The soul's threefold character is one pole of an analogy; the other is the divine Trinity: both are unbodily. Hence, where God's unseen likeness can be found is in the immaterial component of the human composite. "The first Adam," made by the Creator in this likeness, fell from grace. But God redeemed the "second Adam" in a new form. The first Adam had been made "for sensual life (*eis psuchēn zōsan*)," according to Paul; the second was destined "for lifegiving spirit (*eis pneuma zōopoioun*)." In Paul's psychology, soul or life (*psuchē*) is intermediate between the unredeemed flesh (*sarx*) and the spirit (*pneuma*) of redemption.43

As in the triad of intellect, will, and memory, the unseen Trinity shows up in the spirit, the soul, and (somehow) the flesh. For the saved, grace redeems even the sinful body, transforming the corrupt frame of the first Adam with a new glory. Salvation will "change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorified body"—the transfigured body of the resurrected Christ. As the etherized skeleton of human worth, God's triadic image—fouled by sin in earthly souls but restored to glory in heaven—is a distinctly Christian notion. The *dignitas* carried by the image is worthiness and also a rank, gauged theologically as higher or lower, merited or unmerited, saved or lost. Bestowed in creation, it can be taken away by damnation, and we hear about none at all in the fallen Adam's body or Eve's. Intellect, will, and memory mirror the Godhead because they are not bodily: they are *dignitates* in the plural, and dematerialized.44

Other voices of the Christian tradition repeated the themes presented by the anonymous tract on the human condition. When they got their start in this form is hard to say, but the text itself was popular

after the twelfth century, when Augustine's views on the soul's triple faculties excited controversy. Although editors have linked earlier authors, Ambrose and Augustine, with the tract as it stands, Alcuin probably produced it four centuries later.45

Different Christian versions of *dignitas* come from Pope Leo I, who died in 461: they are sermons, securely dated and from an authoritative source. During Leo's very assertive papacy, Christ's place in the Trinity was a contentious issue. One thorny problem was Christ's two natures, divine and human, the latter redeeming all humanity when the Word was made flesh. Leo's response was to preach a theology of incarnation, explaining how, why, and with what results God became human, suffered in the body, and died. Leo's sermons show *dignitas* fully assimilated into the Christian vocabulary.46

The pope uses the word often, but in a political sense only to describe his own primacy or 'apostolic *dignitas*,' a supremacy that contrasts with his lowliness (*humilitas*) as Peter's successor.47 Besides the papal office, other things that have this feature are virtues, martyrdom, feast days, rites, the name 'Christian' itself, and the place (much disputed) of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity. Christ's kingly standing also has it, despite mockery by the Jews. Even so, the name 'Israel' has value too, belonging to the chosen people, their elders, and their priests, though the high priest Caiaphas was "estranged' (*alienabatur*) from priestly *dignitas* when he plotted against Jesus.48

Scripture has *dignitas* when Christians—not Jews—interpret it. When the faithful read the Bible, they find God's image at work in the epic of salvation through Christ's incarnation, passion, resurrection,

and transfiguration. Salvation history begins with man's creation "in the image of God in order to imitate his maker," which is the only way for the "*dignitas* of divine majesty to be in us." Though God himself bestowed this standing on Adam, what the first human wanted was higher angelic rank, an arrogant yearning that cost him "the *dignitas* of his own nature, as he took on the sickly condition that we have." Mankind's primal state was worth a great deal, but Adam squandered its value, losing it for the whole human race until Christ restored it with new merit that augmented the original.49

Leo implores his flock to "wake up and recognize the *dignitas* of your nature…. Since you have been made to share the divine nature, do not turn back and revert to your old vileness (*vilitas*)." We humans will gain the "*dignitas* of God's glory" only if his mercy and truth are in us, an issue to be settled by the spirit's struggle against the flesh: "If the body's desires are stronger, the mind loses its own *dignitas* in disgrace." The worth of the spirit—the best of the human person—is mastery of the flesh.50

The saving paradox—Tertullian said "it deserves belief because it is absurd"—is that the Word became flesh, suffered, and died. "When the Lord of the universe took the form of a slave," Leo writes, "he covered up his majestic *dignitas* with darkness." But then, by suffering in the body, he "restored its lost *dignitas* to our nature, which had fallen overboard from the ark of eternity." Later, the transfigured Christ "revealed the excellence of his own hidden *dignitas*." The Apostles had realized that God's majesty was in Jesus, but they could see no sign of it "in the body that covered up divinity…. While they were still wrapped in mortal flesh, there was no way for them to look and see it." Just as the Lord's flesh had cloaked his glory, the bodies of his disciples also blinded them to it. But finally, when the Savior ascended to heaven, humanity recovered its *dignitas* by proxy. "The nature of humankind

rose up beyond the *dignitas* of all heavenly creatures, above the orders of angels."51

The first human nature to soar so high was Christ's and was also divine, already redeemed by the Redeemer's birth and death in the body. At its best, ordinary human nature—unresurrected and unglorified—is spirit, not soul, which is tainted by the body that it enlivens. Hence, man's noblest nature can be nothing like the mortal body. To be exalted, our vile bodies must be changed, made "like unto his glorified body" after the transfiguration. To be nourished by Christian *dignitas*, the human person must be spiritualized, and the human body must become what it never was or could be—entirely glorious. For ordinary mortals, Christian *dignitas* is pie in the sky.52

"Concentrate on eternity," then, "and leave the temporal behind": that is the advice of *De humanae conditionis dignitate et miseria*, an undated text previously attributed to Anselm of Canterbury, who died in 1109. This little devotional piece resembles other Christian treatments of the topic, though with refinements, one of which develops the distinction between the divine image in man and the likeness. The image is "worthier" (*dignior*), since an animal may resemble a human by likeness (*similitudo*), while "none but another human has the image (*imago*) of a human." Applying the same distinction to meritorious acts, Christians (like the ancient pagans) can practice the natural virtues to perfect God's likeness in us. But enacting the divine image means "doing what God does eternally" by remembering, understanding, and loving the best of all, which is God. "For salvation," by that triad of psychic exercises, "you will express the *dignitas* of your creation," a state so elevated that its glory is incomprehensible.

The unspeakable glory is real, if ethereal, and the incarnate God has saved it for sinners striving to be righteous. Meanwhile, vainglory and foolish joy are traps to be avoided by shunning the world's "parade of

<sup>52</sup> Note 45 in this chapter.

*dignitates*" and attending to "the miseries of the present life." Life itself is a shaky bridge over the chasm of hell. Having exalted the divine in man's spirit, the same writer bewails the body's condition at the end of life in language meant to disgust and horrify. In death the flesh will be "stinking and pitiful, consumed by rot and worms." Crawling into every portal of the senses, they stuff the throat and belly to make "the body's whole frame melt away in rot."53

In the line of Christian assaults on the human condition, none suppurates more than the infamous account *Of the Misery of the Human Condition* written by Cardinal Lotario dei Segni in 1195. Dedicating his work to human vileness (*vilitas*), the cardinal promises that he will also "describe the *dignitas* of human nature, humbling the exalted in the present work, then in the next one exalting the humble." But no exaltation ever came: not as diverting as the misery, perhaps? Within three years, Lotario was just too busy, as Pope Innocent III. For almost two decades, he ruled with great energy, chastising heretics, launching crusades, organizing a great ecclesiastical council, frustrating lay authorities, and aggrandizing his own office. Like Leo the Great, he promoted papal primacy with skill and zeal. Today, however, more people remember him for his tirade on human misery than for any of that. No wonder: the language is unforgettable, whatever one thinks of the message.54

Right from the start every human is a disaster. Everyone is born naked, weak, and defiled, covered by blood—"filthy to describe, filthy to hear about, filthiest of all to look at…. Oh, the vile worthlessness (*indignitas*) of the human condition, the unworthy state of human vileness (*vilitas*)!" Clearly, *dignitas* was on Lotario's mind, even though his subject was the opposite. He treats it as rank and status: worse than a distraction, it is an occasion of sin. It incites the ambitious, the

power-hungry lust for it, and the proud confuse it with genuine honor. An arrogant person "reckons that his *dignitas* gets more from him than he gets from his *dignitas*." But in the end "power and *dignitas* lie deformed in the dust."55

Until the body returns to dust, it is a prison, and Lotario assumes that everyone wants to escape. "Surely, if you don't want to get out of the body, you don't want to get out of prison since the body is the prison of the soul." As long as the flesh entombs the spirit, "Fear and trembling are all around, toil and pain are everywhere." For the saved, release comes when the body dies, but for the damned the body's sorry tale is a preview of hell. When Cicero warned that the body's pleasures can eliminate *dignitas*, his language was genteel, where the cardinal's is hysterical. The body is doomed to be vile by its matter, "food for the undying worm that keeps gnawing and eating." He speaks directly to the body, taunting it as the dirt of creation and corruption: "Why are you proud," he asks the mud. "What exalts you, dust? Ashes, why, do you boast?"56

Job had the same conversation with decay, saying, "You are my father," and telling the worms, "You are my mother and sister." This prompted Lotario to review the body's whole sad story:

How filthy the father, how vile the mother, how horrid the sister! Man is conceived from blood rotted by the heat of lust, and at the end the worms attend his corpse like pall-bearers. Alive, he breeds lice and parasites. Dead, he will produce worms and flies. When he lives, shit and vomit are his products, rot and stench when he dies.57

Coming from any author, so much guignol would be grand and memorable. With a pope's name attached, it is immortal. Cardinal Lotario

could not have painted a scene much more repellent, by any standards, or more repugnant to any conception of dignity. And yet his rant about the human condition just extends the Christian tradition. Still, why this particular work became a target for Manetti and others is easy to see—with or without a pontifical signature.

## Manetti's Dignity II

This was a book on misery that impressed its readers, including Petrarch, who noticed the author's unkept promise to make the contrary case as well. Weighing a challenge to deliver what Lotario did not, the poet found his task harder than the cardinal's because "human misery is most extensive, while happiness is small." In Petrarch's view, that dour assessment reflected prior Christian experience: he claimed that no one before him had even tried to "investigate the *dignitas* of the human condition." When Facio and Manetti set out to improve on Petrarch's effort, they had no cause to disagree: Lotario's denunciation of vile humanity was the state of the art.58

The cardinal's diatribe had been promoted to papal status long before Manetti dared to attack it—with gusto. Why his assault was so unguarded is unclear: maybe because he was writing for a king and competing with a rival, Facio, who had dedicated his own effort to a pope. Who knows? No nuance of patronage was too subtle for a Florentine diplomat to manipulate. Sincerity is also a possibility: maybe Manetti simply found Lotario's invective as loathsome as it is.59

Otherwise, since he venerated the sages of his faith, since he honored the wisdom of the pagans, Manetti could search in many places for *dignitas*. What he brought back is thin and disappointing. To be

Bernardo, S. Levin, and R. Bernardo (New York: Italica Press, 2005), 641 (16.9); Trinkaus, *Image and Likeness*, 179–82.

<sup>59</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate*, 4.18–19, 44–45.

sure, he is fond of the word and uses it more than Pico would in his *Oration*: twenty-two times. But in a book of thirty-one thousand words—148 pages in the standard edition—this means that *dignitas* appears only once every seven pages or so, hardly enough to sustain it as a thematic term, distinct from others.

In almost all instances, what *dignitas* belongs to is *homo* or something *humanus*. All but uniquely, it is a feature of mankind; the human race; human nature; man's first ancestors; the human soul and its faculties; or the human body and its parts. Exceptionally, it also attaches to Manetti's book, but only because Manetti says so once. The larger point is clear: *dignitas* is human, and humans have *dignitas*. Otherwise, we learn very little. Mankind has something—call it *d* for dignity. In Manetti's inflated prose, we see *d* associated—repetitiously—with other things, *p, q, r*, and so on. So *d* goes along, in various ways, with *p, q, r*, and the others. That's the whole story, as far as conceptualizing *d* is concerned.60

As a result, Manetti's presentation of *d* is vague, in an account whose structure is simple, though it fills four books: the first three deal with the body, the soul, and the body/soul composite; the fourth refutes the case against *d* in humans, especially Lotario's harangue.

Much of the first book goes to long excerpts from Cicero and Lactantius, where *dignitas* comes up only once, when Lactantius describes the human torso. In fact, Lactantius seldom uses the word which is surprising, since he has been called the 'Christian Cicero.' Manetti's large piece of Cicero comes from a study of religion, *On the Nature of the Gods*, which argues for divine providence from design in nature—especially human nature. Erect stature, nimble fingers, well-placed organs of sense, powers of speech and reason, and other endowments are signs of order in humans, also evidence of divine forethought immanent in the world. For Lactantius, the foresight is transcendent and also personal, flowing from the Creator's mind and will, but the evidence is much the same. Human features too orderly to

be accidental are also very special—either rare elsewhere in nature or missing. Mankind is extraordinary, then, standing out from the rest of nature and surpassing everything else.61

Like Lactantius in his study *Of God's Craftwork* and like Cicero *On the Nature of the Gods*, Manetti reviews a larger set of human features (*Q1*) to argue that humans have another smaller set (*Q2*). He includes *d* in *Q2*. For him and for his sources, the *Q1* list is long and detailed, containing many more items than *Q2*, which he derives by induction informally and rhetorically—from *Q1*.

Any step of the induction can fail. For *d* as dignity, in some familiar sense, no single entry on the *Q1* list nor all of them—from what Manetti tells us—entails that *d* is in *Q2*, even though Manetti puts *dignitas* there. Rationality might be listed in *Q1*, for example, and reasoning might promote understanding, which—arguably—could help with *d*. But rationality sometimes breeds cynicism instead. Or immortality: from the experience of endless life, some deeply experienced *d* might emerge, and yet eternity might just be boring, not rewarding at all. Suppose rational and immortal humans were created in God's image: the Creator's majesty might show up as *d* in such creatures. But assets of divine majesty, bodiless and perfect in every way, can do nothing for *d* in imperfect, embodied humans: omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, and so on cannot be finite, bodily, or humanized.

Manetti never shows that *d* must belong to every human or even what it is. He never argues in this way:

- 1. Every *d* is *X*.
- 2. Also, whatever has *X* has *d*.
- 3. But every human has X.
- 4. Therefore, every human has *d*.

Dei*, 8.1–13.9, esp. 10.26; Cicero, *De natura deorum libri tres, with Introduction and Commentary*, ed. J. Mayor and J.

For *d* as Kantian dignity and *X* as intrinsic worth, the schema seems promising, though dubious for *X* as immortality or rationality: in such cases, the argument goes wrong at the start. The first premise must be a satisfactory definition or at least a workable description, which Manetti never supplies, while stating the third premise in many different forms and asserting the conclusion often.

Quarreling with a pope about the human condition, Manetti insists that humans have *dignitas* without saying what it is, though contemporaries were asking such definitional questions about liberty, republican virtue, and other ideas debated in the literature of 'civic humanism.' Matteo Palmieri's discussion *Of Civic Life*, for example, was circulating in Florence and elsewhere before Manetti decided to answer Lotario. Palmieri writes that

each one's standing (*dignità*) is the basis on which public honors are distributed. In a commonwealth (*reppublica*), it's difficult to determine whose standing is greater because of various disagreements about it. The noble and powerful say that standing is to be located in abundant resources and old, aristocratic families. Populists put it in well-meaning talk among the cultured about living free and in peace. The learned call it the ability to get things done.62

Since Palmieri's focus is sociopolitical, he starts by describing *dignità* more or less as Cicero had, as status that comes with public office and civic engagement. Then he examines it as a socioeconomic commodity, a cultural ideal and a tool of politics, knowing that there are competing versions of *dignità*. For Manetti, however, *dignitas* is not a contested idea; the contest that he wants to win is about which creatures have it.

<sup>62</sup> Matteo Palmieri, *Della vita civile* (Florence: Sansoni, 1982) 3.136–37; James Hankins, "Machiavelli, Civic Humanism and the Humanist Politics of Virtue," *Italian Culture* 23 (2014): 103.

Lacking a better account of *dignitas* by Manetti, where else can we go to learn what he might have said? Statements that include the word not quite two dozen—give us little to go on. Widening the search and also looking for *dignus*, the adjective cognate with the noun, will more than double our information. One use of *dignus* can be eliminated as unhelpful, however: the much repeated *memoratu dignus* or 'worth mentioning.' Subtracting it leaves more than fifty cases where other words used with *dignus* or *dignitas* say something instructive. Most occur only once, and in every instance the paired word is inherently positive or positively meant. The aggregate good news is about fitness, power, rank, size, and stature.

Associated words used more than once—to deliver the same message—are 'excellent' (*excellens*), 'great' (*magnus*), 'lofty' (*sublimis*), 'outstanding' (*praestans*), and 'wonderful' (*admirabilis*). In keeping with the title of Manetti's book, *excellentia* is the most frequent partner for *dignitas*, and *praestantia* comes next in the blur of pleonasms. Humans have *dignitas,* and they excel, standing out from everything around them. Human creatures so well equipped surpass the rest of creation. The word is relative, then, expressing rank. The *d* in question is neither unrelatable nor intrinsic nor incomparable. Understood in Manetti's way, *dignitas* feeds on comparison and starves without it.63

Ever since Kant theorized about *Würde*, the debate about dignity has gone on and on. Kant himself identified the Latin *dignitas* with *Würde*, stirring up excitement about Pico's misnamed *Oration*. Suppose the mistake had been different and the speech had been

<sup>63</sup> For *dignitas* and its pairings, see note 60 of this chapter, linking with 'broad' (*latus*), 'distinguished' (*praecipuus*), 'exalted' (*exaltatus*), 'genuine' (*verus*), 'handsome' (*amplus*), 'immense' (*immensus*), 'incredible' (*incredibilis*), 'lordly' (*dominans*), 'mighty' (*potens*), 'noble' (*nobilis*), 'ranked' (*gradatus*), 'suitable' (*accomodatus*), and 'unique' (*unicus*): to simplify this list, various forms of the word have been converted to adjectives. For *dignus* and its pairings, see Manetti, *De dignitate,* 1.pr.1-, 34, 43–45, 52; 2.8, 23, 30; 3.11, 13, 22, 41, 45, 49–50, 56, 59; 4.18, 25, 28.

mislabeled differently, as an *Oratio de hominis excellentia* or *De praestantia hominis*—words from Manetti's *d* vocabulary. Had Pico been thought to orate about 'excellence' or 'superiority,' would so much fuss have been made about the speech or about 'humanist' ideas of dignity? Not likely. In human affairs, where all the timber is crooked, how could *Würde* excel or surpass anything—in Kantian terms? Kant's is a modern dignity that belongs incomparably to everyone.

## Manetti's Dignity III

Not so for Manetti, whose *dignitas* is synonymous, more or less, with *excellentia* and *praestantia*—though what such words mean to him is notable in its own right: more on that later. For now, my topic is his use of *dignitas*, which is not just evaluative but also exclusionary—as the ancient Romans used it for rank and status and medieval Christians for God's image reflected in man. No woman, child, or slave could excel with *dignitas* in Rome. In medieval Christendom, however, all soldiers of the church militant were members of Christ's spiritual body, battling the flesh to cross the bridge from this vale of tears—on the road, at least, to a spiritualized *dignitas*. But what about Muslims? Heathens in Brazil? Those cases would prove difficult. No doubt about the unchurched Christians in hell, however, damned but still human. Those poor souls have lost *dignitas* forever—more pitiful than Adam, whose loss was redeemed.64

Among the deadliest sins of the damned, all seven can be bodily and three must be, to some extent: lust, sloth, and gluttony. The body

<sup>64</sup> Anthony Pagden, *The Fall of Natural Man: The American Indian and the Origins of Comparative Ethnology* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, *Renaissance Philosophy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 112–16; Lars Pharo, "The Council of Valladolid (1550–1551): A European Disputation about the Human Dignity of Indigenous Peoples of the Americas," in Düwell et al., *Cambridge Handbook of Human Dignity*, 95–100.

is a cesspool of sin: that is the papal position rejected by Manetti. In the process, he did not produce a clear concept of *dignitas* or modernize it. But he accomplished something else by revaluing the body and showing new esteem for human energy and ingenuity—especially the artistic kind. Most of his comments on the body come in the first and fourth books of his work. Much of the first book is by Cicero and Lactantius. But the refutation of human misery in the fourth is all Manetti and quite lively.

A preliminary move sets Lotario up by restating his vituperation of the body: weak, naked, fragile, rotten, short-lived, defective in its senses, self-destructive in its actions, vulnerable to the least threats of injury and disease, it never recovers from its origin and growth out of the filthiest matter—the slime of the earth and the stink of menstruation. The papal screed is haphazard, Manetti complains, though evidently hard to forget:

It goes on endlessly with a variety of remarks about these many troubles of the human body: nakedness, lice, spit, piss, shit, fleeting time, advancing age, the different pains that mortals suffer, the various things that people try, the nearness of death, and the many types of torment.

To counter all this, Manetti points out that what is "best and delectable" in the human condition was put there by God almighty, so that we should always "live in this world with joy and cheer." Pleasure (*voluptas*) is God's gift—not a pitfall—and a normal expectation of human life. The external senses give immense pleasure, and the internal senses also contribute to the "great pleasures that captivate man." In daily life which sense is most pleasurable? Eating is certainly good. We must eat to live. Food and drink are tasty as well, better than most sensations of touch—except for the "touch specific to the genitals." Philosophers say that "far greater pleasure is felt in sex because nature's purpose was to preserve the species more than individuals, the one by sex between a male and a female, the other by taking nourishment."65

The body's pleasure is excellent, says Manetti, and sex is best of all. This was not Lotario's verdict. "Who does not know," he had asked, "that copulation, even in marriage, never happens without the flesh itching, without heated lust, without the rank stench of excess." Coming from this mire, semen is defiled and pollutes the soul, "like liquid poured from a corrupt vessel." Whatever the body excretes is unclean, says Lotario, but a boon according to Manetti: "Think of what physicians have written about saliva, urine, feces, and hair." These are remedies, antidotes, and fertilizer. Plainly, he is determined to turn every bit of Lotario's blaming into praise.66

Provoked again by Job, Lotario gives a chapter to nakedness: "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked shall I return there." The cardinal charges that humans emerge bare from the gore of childbirth, filthy and defenseless. Manetti's retort—before defending the afterbirth as a physiological necessity—is that nakedness "became man by reason of grace (*decus*) and beauty." If humans were born with hides or pelts, they would be as ugly as other animals, and man's excellence (*excellentia*) would be hidden. But nature would never conceal the human body, her most splendid production, "with cheap and illfitting veils."67

Just because Lotario had condemned nakedness—one might think—Manetti had to praise it. But other reasons were true to his time, when more and better nakedness could be seen than in Lotario's day: in works of art.

Although pictorial and sculptural art was mainly religious in the Middle Ages, some sacred scenes show people unclothed or nearly so. In the Hebrew Bible, besides the creation, we have Noah drunk,

David peeking at Uriah's wife, and the elders leering at Susanna. Depictions of the Christian Gospels even show Jesus unclothed (See Fig. 5.3)—only partly, most of the time—for his baptism and during his passion and burial. Humans roasting in purgatory have left flesh and bones behind, but souls depicted as bare bodies make the burning visible and plausible. The dead unwind their shrouds at the Judgment. Some are saints, like Sebastian—naked except for the arrows. There was no shortage of imagery, to which medieval artists regularly applied their skill.68

Still, just thinking of the male figure, there is nothing in medieval art like Michelangelo's David or Adam—or the Greco-Roman artifacts that instructed Alberti, Botticelli, Donatello, Leonardo, Mantegna, the elder Pollaiuolo, and others before Adam was pictured on the Sistine Chapel ceiling in 1511, just as Julius II was moving the Apollo Belvedere (penis missing, but no fig leaf ) to the Vatican. A few years earlier, Michelangelo had seen the male nudes of the Laocoon writhing during its excavation. But Manetti died in 1459, long before these capital events of archaeology and the body's grand apotheosis in sculpture and painting. At an earlier stage, however, he may have sensed the force of this enormous change in human experience and attitudes.69

Praising the soul in the second book of his work, he sets out to prove the "large scope and excellence of the soul's faculties" by examining "great deeds and the remarkable devices people have thought up and so admirably invented." Ancient examples are the pyramids of Egypt but also the first ship, built by Jason for the Argonauts. Knowing how valuable the "technology of sailing" was to his own

society, Manetti looks homeward for other feats of engineering, finding them in

more recent structures that are new, and in the very sharp mind of Filippo, called Brunelleschi, in our day surely the prince of all architects, who erected a great—no, an immense—vault for Florence's Temple with no wooden or iron framework, as stunning as that is to say.

Manetti, a Florentine, had to look no farther than his city's proudest church for proof of supreme human skill in architecture, and for the pictorial arts he could also stay at home. First he runs through the usual list of ancient painters and then adds Praxiteles, Phidias, and Polyclitus for sculpture. In painting, "What to say about our Giotto, the best painter of his time? … It seems right to set him alongside the ancient and supreme masters of this art and compare them." In sculpture, Ghiberti's Doors of Paradise for Florence's Baptistery equal anything by the Greeks. "What to report about Lorenzo," he asks, "the most eminent sculptor of our time, whose outstanding and amazing talents are on public display, especially on the doors of our sacred Temple that he ennobled and glorified?" Is this praise for the arts in Florence just patriotic boilerplate from a diplomat's speeches?70

Likewise, maybe Manetti is just reciting from a source to describe a celebrated Aphrodite by Praxiteles, so lovely "that it was hard to keep her safe and undefiled by the leering glances of bypassers." This anecdote from a book on exemplary behavior has been toned down by comparison to other old tales about the charms of statuary: reporting on Praxiteles with less reserve, Pliny had written that "a certain person was so gripped by love for the statue that one night he hid away, hugging it close, and as evidence left the stain of his lust on the likeness."71

<sup>71</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate*, 2.40; Val. Max. 8.11 ext. 4.; Plin. *Nat*. 36.21.

Such early records of the higher pornography—for better or worse captured a common and authentic human response. When Manetti retails one of these stories, while commending his city's artistic glories, perhaps he too says something genuine about feelings of two kinds, sexual and aesthetic, as they converge on the visual experience of art. A little speculation is worthwhile—for chronological reasons.

By 1504, when Michelangelo finished his majestic David in marble, with its full-frontal display of genitalia, Manetti had been dead for nearly fifty years. He can have seen no nudes by Botticelli or Leonardo—still children when he died. Pollaiuolo was just leaving his father's workshop. Mantegna made the splendid St. Sebastians in Vienna and the Louvre after 1455: he was sketching nudes before then, however, though none that Manetti could have seen. Most of the great Quattrocento images of the human form were unavailable to him—except perhaps one, Donatello's bronze David (See Fig. 5.4), now in the Bargello. Some critics have doubted that David is the beautiful young boy—naked except for high-top sandals and a fetching cap. Others have named Cosimo de' Medici as the source of the commission and have dated the statue as early as the 1420s: Donatello had made a clothed David for public showing in Florence by 1416.72

Did Manetti ever see the nude David in bronze, the first casting of its kind since antiquity? Probably so, if Donatello finished it by midcentury—as seems likely. In any case, since Mantegna and others were sketching nudes before Manetti started to write, ventures so bold were underway in Italy: such innovations in art impressed him, remarkable novelties like the "great deeds" of Giotto, Ghiberti, and Brunelleschi.

Still, though nudity, male and/or female, may have given Manetti delight and moved him to praise the body, his measure of humankind at its best was still Christian and more otherworldly than not. Toward the close of his fourth book, trying hard to wind the story down, he

dismisses warnings about human troubles because "man's pleasure is continuous from the moment of birth until the very end." Then he refutes the contrary claims by invoking "the final resurrection of our bodies." He promises that "when we rise again, we shall take up our deceased bodies, most gloriously—without any blemish, corruption, weakness, or deformity." In perfect health and lasting youth, never needing sleep and without suffering, we shall live again in a body something like Christ's was at the age of thirty. It will be a transfigured, glorified body, "delicate and light, … shining and unstained, … of flawless beauty." In the end, as the damned look up hopelessly at the saved, they will see "bright, airy, agile, graceful, and immortal bodies that never know pain."73

Whether Manetti ever looked on beauty bare, by contemplating the body as idealized in Quattrocento art, he never abandoned a different idealization, the glorified body that is a likeness of the transfigured Christ. Any nobility in this keystone of Christian dogma vanishes in the fairy tale of immortality that follows—a timeless paradise populated by bodies too glorified to be avatars of mortal, earthly originals. With many words, while maintaining that humans have *dignitas*, Manetti puts the body forward as evidence. But he fails both ways. His *dignitas* has no conceptual basis. And his glorified bodies cannot plausibly be pictured or even imagined.

Imagine Aunt Fiona and Uncle Fred called to glory, Fiona with her remarkable overbite, Fred as cross-eyed as ever. Glorifying those beloved faces would deplete them. In any believable picturing of the choir invisible, the bodies—naked bodies especially—will look a little vile because all bodies are a little vile, at least—even Adam's on the ceiling. Pater suggests as much about "that languid figure, … rude and satyr-like." This Adam "has hardly strength enough to lift his finger," and he says nothing. But his nakedness speaks more in silence about human dignity than Manetti ever could with all his words.74

## Conclusion

Nonetheless, Manetti's praise of the body and of human energy and skill earns applause, even though his orotund talk about *dignitas* is sketchy in content, mainly rhetorical, and vacuous at bottom. The scanty *dignitas* in Pico's *Oration* is of no use at all to students of dignity: that notion is not the subject of his speech. If Pico's *dignitas* is useless and Manetti's is uninteresting, why bother? For two reasons. First, history has made Pico too big to fail. Second, habitual misconceptions of the *Oration* are symptoms of larger strains in modern conversations about dignity. Since Manetti's book is the fullest Quattrocento treatment of the Latin analog of 'dignity,' his treatment of *dignitas* is also relevant especially to show what Pico was not talking about.

The strain on 'dignity' in modern times—as in Manetti's day—has been rhetorical in no small part, tempting many to the sin of bathos, a 'depth' to which one sinks by failing to rise. The Internet calls it "an abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect." The 'exalted' or 'sublime' for ancient literary critics was *hupsos*, or 'height,' with bathos as its opposite, when attempted *hupsos* ends badly and exaltation crashes. Not all *bathos* is bad, however, if it really goes deep, in a good way—like Christ's love, which is both deep and high in the Epistle to the Ephesians. Bathos comes in types and degrees.75

Here is a mild case, headlined by the *New York Times* a few years ago:

## Restore a Gateway to Dignity

The words are meant to be stirring. The article they introduce explores a serious issue, plans to replace Penn Station, a major railway terminal in Manhattan. To "address the calamity that is Penn Station," the author compares it with Grand Central Station: passing through it is

<sup>75</sup> Ephes. 3:18; [Long.] *Subl*.; https://en.wikipedia.org.

"an ennobling experience," whereas Penn Station is "a humiliation" hence the missing dignity and the call to restore it. But look: this is just journalism, New York City journalism in the Age of Hype, when any human misfortune qualifies as a 'tragedy'—gripes from Aristotle notwithstanding. Why fret about a little heartfelt hyperbole? Because this bathos is about 'dignity' and at ground level, not yet headed for the stratosphere. Such commonplace bathos is all around us, sometimes with 'dignity' in tow.76

A more recent piece from the *New Yorker* about Anthony Trollope cashes in on the conspicuous expenditure of 'dignity.' Trollope, careful about time and money, could have modeled rationality for Max Weber. A writer himself, the author explains that "writers talking about time are like painters talking about unprimed canvas and pigments." Riding a crest of wit, he adds an insider's joke: "Nor is there anything philistine about writers talking money. Inside the ballroom at the PEN banquet, it's all freedom and dignity; outside, it's all advances."77

The author of the Penn Station article is serious about dignity in a train station—just as Cicero was serious about the house on the Palatine. The author of the Trollope article knows that seriousness about 'dignity' can be funny. The second article has no connection with the first, just taking it for granted that 'dignity' can do a comic turn. This is odd, considering the word's grave prominence in such places as the UN Declaration of 1948, whose first "whereas" is that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."78

Freedom, justice, and peace are serious matters. By proclaiming them in this way, the world's chief deliberative body intended to combat war, genocide, racism, hunger, disease, and other problems of that

magnitude. How could a key term in its proclamation—"dignity" become an occasion for comedy? In part, because this is a notable case of a common failing in a pronouncement that overdraws its moral accounts by asserting the rights of "the human family." Family? The Declaration was adopted three years after the bombing of Hiroshima.

But "family" here is a hope, aspiring to a worthy ideal. And politics, not to speak of international politics, demands the leaky writing by committee that produced the Declaration—which has no author, only "drafters," and not everyone is Thomas Jefferson. Complaining about bathos in the UN Declaration is mean-spirited, and mockery would be worse. Yet mockery we have always with us.

In the pivotal (for Pico) year of 1948, when the Declaration was made official, Evelyn Waugh published *The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy*, his savage parody of the American funeral industry. *Vile Bodies* had been his breakout book in 1930. Jessica Mitford (Waugh had pursued her sister) followed *The Loved One* with *The American Way of Death*. What Waugh had done as a novelist, she did again as a reporter, tallying the data about burying the dead in North America. One datum was a meeting organized "to upgrade the standard of dying," as Mitford puts it, by the Society of American Florists. The Society's stake in the funeral business was large. To protect it, a Symposium on Sentiment was convened, and the assembled florists heard a Statement on Memorialization that, in Mitford's description, "had quite a lot to say about the Dignity of Man, the United States as champion of freedom and leader of the democratic nations of the world, the importance of the individual, the profound traditions of the centuries and so on."79

<sup>79</sup> Evelyn Waugh, *The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy* (New York: Little Brown, 1948); Jessica Mitford, *The American Way of Death Revisited* (New York: Random House, 1998), 78–79. The year 1948 was quite a watershed for Pico and dignity: while the UN was making its Declaration, the *Renaissance Philosophy of Man* put the *Oration* into English, and *Walden II* made B. F. Skinner famous for novelizing the behaviorism made more explicit by *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*. But that is another story.

Sounds like Jessica had heard about the UN's Declaration. The Statement that she reports on declares that

the final rites, memorial tributes, the hallowed pageant of the funeral service all speak for the dignity of man…. Memorialization is love … [that] can never die. It is the recognition of the immortality of the human spirit, the rightful reverence earned by the good life. It is the final testimony to the dignity of man.80

Comedy cannot deflate a balloon before something has inflated it. For the "dignity of man," what was this? How had that sonorous phrase become an incitement to ridicule by the middle of the last century? A large part of the story was politics as usual, as in the UN Declaration. A smaller part was the continual boosting of Pico della Mirandola as the herald of modern human dignity. The collection of Renaissance texts that disseminated his speech to American college students also came out in 1948.

Going on sixty years later, Pico thrives: a Wikipedia site advertises his *Oration* as the "Manifesto of the Renaissance" and "a key text of Renaissance humanism." The adulation echoes long-playing praises of a type sustained by a prize-winning book, *The Idea of the Renaissance*, where a whole chapter goes to "Pico della Mirandola and Renaissance Ambition." The authors try to capture the *Oration* in an arpeggio of extrapolations from it, noting that the speech is "often … taken to be constitutive of the Renaissance as a period" and that it "divulged the self-conceived dignity of Renaissance man." Pico's words, unpublished by him and prefacing a canceled debate, are his "definitive testament, and its traditional place in Renaissance studies seems … appropriate."81

Why make so much in such grand language of a failed speech? Why idolize its author—claiming, for example, that at the end of the eighteenth century "the structure of the Piconian moment … reappeared in Kant's mathematical sublime: an apprehension of the majesty of the illimitable, … producing a restless aspiration similar to that of Pico's Adam"? Alas: Kant was more responsible for our mistakes about Pico than Pico was for Kant's idea of the sublime. Such misunderstandings of history and philosophy are easier to correct than lapses of judgment in prose that propagates them—though that is one of the aims of comedy like Mitford's. One would think that mockery like hers would make bathos too risky. But writing about dignity—especially with Pico in the cast—is a festival of bathos.82
