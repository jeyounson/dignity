# Chapter 9: On Bourgeois Dignity - Making the Self-Made Man

*Christine Dunn Henderson*

Somewhere near the beginning of the eighteenth or end of the seventeenth century—the exact date is impossible to pinpoint, nor is it essential to what follows—a new concept of "dignity" was emerging. Taking hold first in the northern countries of Europe and quickly spreading to England, where a new socioeconomic class was coming to prominence, this idea of dignity emerged from the distinctive set of values and ideas associated with that class.1 The rising group was the bourgeoisie, a name that today is virtually inseparable from its Marxist connotations, but which had a less freighted origin in medieval and

Quentin Skinner and Martin van Gelderen (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 105–27, argues—rightly, I think—for an earlier emergence of the "citizen," an idea that, particularly in terms of independence, can be later linked to the bourgeoisie I am describing. One could also point to the Renaissance humanists for the seeds of certain aspects of bourgeois dignity. My purpose here, however, is simply to describe this new notion of dignity, rather than to date its appearance.

late Latin: the *burgensis*, or simply, the free inhabitant of a city.2 Tied to neither land nor lord, freed from the obligations of feudalism, the bourgeoisie was commercial in orientation, and its rise ushered in a new understanding of virtue: the bourgeois virtues, a group of qualities describing the character traits and habits necessary for success in commercial life. Ennobling the middling, commercial way of life and the virtues associated with it is the essence of bourgeois dignity. This chapter will explore the development of a distinctive concept of bourgeois dignity in the eighteenth century, investigating first the key elements of the so-called bourgeois virtues that provided content to this new ethos of dignity. Next, it will probe the economic, political, and social conditions that facilitated the emergence and diffusion of bourgeois dignity, before briefly considering bourgeois dignity as a contested concept. Finally, it will discuss how this new understanding of dignity was refined and then diffused throughout British society by one of the most influential literary endeavors of the eighteenth century, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's *The Spectator* (1711–1714).

First, however, a terminological clarification is necessary. Although we have come to call this emergent class the bourgeoisie, to speak of an eighteenth-century "bourgeoisie" or even a "middle class" risks anachronism. "Bourgeoisie" was occasionally employed to describe the urban middle classes in the eighteenth century, but the more common term was "middling," an adjective broad in its application. The "middling condition" encompassed a wide range of ways of life, from various professionals to the affluent merchant to the modest shopkeeper. What distinguished the middling class from the nonworking aristocracy on one hand, and the laboring, "mechanick" part of society (or the vulgar and coarse, urban-dwelling "cit") on the other, was that their activities not only "fed and clothed them," as historian Peter Earle

<sup>2</sup> The *OED* locates the first usage of "bourgeois" at the end of the sixteenth century; by the beginning of the nineteenth century, its application to the middle class had emerged, and in 1850, *The Communist Manifesto* emphasized an exploitative and pejorative dimension.

puts it, but "also enabled them to accumulate on a regular basis and so improve themselves" and their condition in life.3 As we will see, this increased economic power was accompanied by gradual increases in prestige, social standing, and, eventually, political power.

## The Bourgeois Virtues

The excellence or virtues proper to the broad group of individuals composing the middling condition were those that facilitated and sustained commercial life. The bourgeois virtues, then, began as instrumental virtues—character qualities conducive to a given material end. Over time, however, these qualities became desirable in their own right, and to possess them was to have one's moral standing elevated and dignified, both in the individual's own mind and within society at large. Benjamin Franklin's *Autobiography* illustrates the dramatic elevation the bourgeois virtues had experienced by the end of the eighteenth century. Of the thirteen moral virtues Franklin deemed essential to happiness and prosperity, seven are bourgeois virtues: temperance, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, and moderation. The *Autobiography*'s praises of order, frugality, and industry underscore the commercial context of these virtues' practice and their pragmatic character; Franklin's list of virtues advises, "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time," "make no expense but to do good to others or yourself," and "lose no time; be always emply'd in something useful."4

Thus, we see that on the one hand, qualities such as thrift, work, honesty, foresight, temperance, moderation, independence, and selfimprovement had come to be classed squarely among the virtues by

the turn of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, such virtues were also distinctly bourgeois, and the connections between many of these traits and the habits and skills required for successful commerce are easily enough drawn.5 To save enough capital to expand his business, for example, the merchant must be thrifty, while honesty—which becomes sincerity when writ large in society—is an essential attribute for the merchant who wishes to secure return customers and a favorable reputation. Similarly, foresight is indispensable to the long-range planning necessary for successful commercial endeavors, and it is particularly important for merchants wishing to improve their condition by expanding their business activities. More indirect connections can also be drawn to account for some of the less obvious virtues. For example, predictability or regularity of character is an essential precondition for foresight's operation, since what it regular, predictable, or even standardized is more easily foreseen than what is contingent or unique.6 Here we can also glimpse the importance of a distinctly bourgeois temperance and moderation—that is, a species of temperance that is not so much "moral" in origin as utilitarian and "commercial."

The bourgeois way of life is built around individuals, and particularly around the idea of the individual, understood outside the contexts of family, clan, or faith group. During this period of bourgeois ascent, this burgeoning individualism manifests itself in a variety of culturalpolitical ways that created cycles of reciprocity that further enhanced the individual's standing and, as we will see more clearly, his dignity.7 Within the context of the bourgeois virtues, this new individualism manifests as a particular esteem for self-reliance or independence.

<sup>5</sup> The rough classification that follows is a gross oversimplification. For example, connections between what I describe as personal qualities and what I call framing qualities clearly exist, but focusing on those interconnections would be distracting and would not, I think, add to the explanations of the various qualities' content.

<sup>6</sup> For similar reasons, predictability of the world is also desirable. See the discussion below of the knowledge culture out of which bourgeois dignity emerges.

<sup>7</sup> See below.

Most obviously, self-reliance can be understood in terms of economic independence, but it has other dimensions as well, two of which are particularly worthy of mention. The first is independence of judgment. With neither lord nor master, the bourgeois forms his own opinions and judgments about the world he experiences around him. Second is the related quality of "self-making." Again, bound to no one and responsible for his own fate, the bourgeois can make of himself whatever he wills. Thus, in some sense, the "test" of the individual's abilities (i.e., his or her general character) becomes the ability to rise in station and to succeed in life *through his or her own efforts*. The greater the rise and success, the greater the individual's abilities and overall merit.8 The independence of these self-made men is captured in Frederick Douglass's description of them as indebted only "to themselves for themselves."9 Similarly, one aspect of Addison and Steele's work in *The Spectator*, which we will explore in greater detail later, is the creation indeed, the self-creation—of a certain kind of "polite" individual and the cultivation of the independent judgment required for citizens of Great Britain's burgeoning commercial society.

A variety of background societal value-shifts attest to the changing assessment of these personal characteristics. Consider, for example, the new dignity bestowed on the idea of work in the eighteenth century, and with it, the quality of being hard-working or industrious (ideas that would be put to radical political use under the rubric of the "dignity of labor" in the nineteenth century).10 Valuing work contrasts to the lauding of leisure in older systems of ethics and reflects a society in which it was possible to improve one's station in life and in which work was one key to that improvement. Writing at the end of the eighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft

<sup>8</sup> Though of course this "test" is not a true one, given the importance of luck and other factors beyond any individual's control in his or her success.

hints at another dimension of work's value, proclaiming that work "dignifies the mind."11 Wollstonecraft thus captures the dual nature of the bourgeois understanding of work, for work becomes both a means and, in a certain sense, an end. One effect of this new valuation of work is that a kind of worldly pragmatism, with its direct connections to the practical knowledge required in daily economic life, comes to be esteemed in this period above purely theoretical knowledge.

The rise of the bourgeoisie and the new premium it placed on the individual is also accompanied by a thorough reevaluation of selfinterest. Beginning from the Mandevillean perspective that views self-interest as a vice yielding socially beneficial results, the way was prepared for a rehabilitation of self-interest as both a dependable and a laudable force for good. What is true of self-interest was true of other qualities, and indeed, by the end of the eighteenth century, the bourgeois understanding of goodness and decency did not require eliminating many of the hitherto "standard" sources of vice usually associated with self-interest—such as acquisitiveness or cupidity—but instead sought to channel and reorient these desires and passions so that they might be useful both to the individual and to society at large.

Some less obvious qualities—that is, qualities not directly in the service of individual self-interest, like temperance or marital fidelity—also formed part of the bourgeois virtues, by indirectly helping to create a stable private basis supporting the bourgeois' commercial activities in the public sphere. Similarly, the ideals of conjugal and familial love, whose rising currency maps fairly neatly onto the ascent of the bourgeoisie, can be viewed as supporting the types of family units and living arrangements that were most conducive to middle-class economic prosperity. Respectability and decency fall into this category as well, with the understanding that

<sup>11</sup> Mary Wollstonecraft, *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (London: J. Johnson, 1792), 240.

the reputation for these qualities enhances the social standing and reputation of the holder, while possessing the substance of each of them may also provide one with habits conducive to commercial success.12

Finally, several components of the bourgeois ethos can be understood as framing the type of society in which commerce thrives. First and foremost of these "general framing" components, and following from the ideas of independence and individualism, was a certain type of egalitarianism. This egalitarianism assumed its most obvious political form in the gradual increase of democratic elements within the British political system during the period of bourgeois ascent, making itself felt in social relations within the polity as well. The exceptional permeability of the English gentry and the movement of younger sons of the nobility into the worlds of business and trade also accelerated the process of "dignifying" commerce and the commercial way of life. Thus, Earle notes that by the early eighteenth century, "it is clear that the younger son of a gentleman who went into trade did not for that reason lose all of his gentility, even though he was unable to be as idle as his elder brother." Plainly, "Trade did not defile a gentleman" in eighteenth-century England, and the mutual regard across classes that was strengthening signifies the emergence of a new concept of dignity, one that was more accessible and more inclusive than earlier notions had been.13

Another key element framing the bourgeois virtues at the general societal level is toleration: as Montesquieu famously observed, commerce softens and gentles mores, encouraging communication and peace among peoples.14 In other words, trade between individuals or nations who differ requires that the trading partners forsake going to

<sup>12</sup> Mandeville, of course, sees qualities such as marital fidelity as sham virtues, disguising vices that are themselves publicly beneficial.

war to settle those differences, and that they be willing to tolerate different ways of life, beliefs, and values for the sake of the mutual advantage gained through commerce. What Shaftesbury writes of liberty was thus thought to be true of commerce as well—that "we polish one another, and rub off our corners and rough sides by a sort of amicable collision."15 In addition to the broader and more frequently discussed applications of toleration to matters such as religion, we note that two forms taken by toleration in this period were paradigmatic eighteenthcentury virtues: civility and the related idea of politeness.16

## The Rise of the Bourgeoisie

Without entering into debates raging among historians and economists about why the middle class or bourgeoisie arose during this period and without wading too deeply into the complex relations of ideas, technology, institutions, and economics, it seems incontestable that the development and rise of a middle class is partly attributable to the focus placed by the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment on knowledge, and specifically the focus on technical knowledge.17 With the expansion of print culture, technical and practical knowledge was more easily preserved and shared, thus fueling additional advances. Diderot's *Encyclopédie* is perhaps the most famous example of the diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge, but there were many similar avenues of transmission. International commerce, for example, played a similar role in diffusing scientific and technical

<sup>15</sup> Shaftesbury, *Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times*, vol. 1 (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2001), 42. For Shaftesbury, this buffing liberty is also the source of all politeness.

<sup>16</sup> For a more extended discussion of politeness, see below.

<sup>17</sup> On these debates, see, for example, Joel Mokyr, *The Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain, 1700–1850* (New Haven: Yale University Press), 2009; Deirdre N. McCloskey's multivolume set on the bourgeoisie *The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006) and *Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010); L. E. Birdzell Jr. and Nathan Rosenberg, *How the West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation of the Industrial World* (New York: Basic Books, 1987).

knowledge and in fueling innovation, a fact that both illustrates the interconnectedness of these factors and underlines the impossibility of giving a single-factor account. As Mokyr observes, "The British were rarely coy about utilizing foreign ideas or about reverse-engineering imported inventions. Trade created so-called *exposure effects*, inspiring imitation and innovation through the observation of what foreigners could do."18 Scientific clubs and societies also began to proliferate during this period, thus putting theoretical scientists and technical experts in greater contact with their peers and encouraging a culture that promoted innovative applications of theoretical knowledge to the practical world, eventually including the key technological developments of the Industrial Revolution.19

Mirroring the improvements in the arts and sciences, this same period also saw "improvements" in the science of politics, particularly in terms of the diminution of royal prerogative following the Glorious Revolution. The post-1688 political structure—itself growing out of philosophic roots that included Protestantism and the natural rights theories of John Locke and others—curbed the arbitrary power of the Crown, giving greater authority to Parliament. Diminishing royal prerogative and augmenting parliamentary power began a process of politically acknowledging the people. Although power remained concentrated in the hands of élites, the 1689 Bill of Rights nevertheless guaranteed certain individual rights such as freedom of expression, while ending various royal abuses such as arbitrary taxation and property seizure. As famously argued by Douglass North and Barry Weingast, the post-1688 redesign of fiscal and governmental institutions made credible the regime's commitment to property rights, and

this commitment was reflected in the growth of free markets and in the successful economic performance that followed.20

Whatever the exact timing and causal mixture among the various intellectual, cultural, and political factors, the economic effects were felt relatively quickly. By the early eighteenth century, Britain was already a comparatively prosperous economy, with income per capita and living standards well above those of all other European countries except the Netherlands (the other home of the bourgeoisie); multiple urban centers of significant size; extensively developed domestic and international trade; and a high level of agricultural productivity that made it possible for the agricultural class to require as little as 30 percent of the total labor population, about half that of other European countries, again with the exception of the Netherlands. A significant portion of the remaining 70 percent of the population could be categorized as of the "middling" condition, living above subsistence levels, augmenting their holdings, and consuming nonessential goods. While the "middling sort" might not yet have been conscious of itself as a distinct class, its growth fueled further developments in economics and led to the emulation of its values and practices by other social groups.21

The complex interplay of changes in the scientific/technical, cultural, political, and economic arenas led to sociological shifts. In particular, with the rise of the middling station came changed assessments of the bourgeois way of life and values. Qualities once disdained became praised, bourgeois values were transformed into virtues, and the bourgeois way of life gradually came to be thought worthy of emulation. As these new cultural norms were shaped, new tastes and vocabularies gained currency, and a new ethos—one in which the bourgeois individual and the bourgeois way of life acquired status and

dignity—began to displace older points of view, disdainful of labor, commerce, and so on. Thus, Daniel Defoe would assert in *Robinson Crusoe* (1719), "The middle State … is the best State in the World, the most suited to Human Happiness."22 Deirdre McCloskey sums up this transition by stating, "An old class of town dwellers, formerly despised by the clergy and the aristocracy and the peasantry, began to acquire a more dignified standing, in the way people thought and talked about it, in European rhetoric about middle-class activities."23

## Critics of Bourgeois Life

Explicitly dignifying the bourgeois way of life and the qualities associated with it via public endorsement in the press or from the pulpit was, however, a contested matter during this epoch. Praising a life of work, accumulation, and thrift—much less the practice of these qualities in *commerce*—and holding the bourgeois way of life and its values as ideals to be emulated was a controversial notion, for the bourgeois outlook ran counter to the dominant model of aristocratic virtue and its own conception of dignity, which emphasized pride, leisure, honor, and chivalry.24 Although by the seventeenth century, the English landed class had become relatively entrepreneurial, its general attitude toward the merchant's way of life remained disdainful.25 The aristocratic concept of dignity was, of course, rooted in earlier traditions, and the dignity of the hardworking, bourgeois shopkeeper is equally far from the dignity of Aristotle's magnanimous man as from the Socratic, Stoic, or Roman ideals.

<sup>24</sup> See Remy Debes's introduction to this volume, which discusses the early modern "merit" connotation of dignity.

<sup>25</sup> The quip, "I made my money the old-fashioned way: I inherited it" comes to mind as exemplifying this mindset, as do scenes like Lady Catherine's disdain, in *Pride and Prejudice*, for the Gardiners simply because Mr. Gardiner is in trade.

The relationship between Christianity and the bourgeois way of life is a complex one. A first glance suggests tensions between the bourgeois/commercial acquisitiveness and the biblical prohibition against usury, as well as the Christian rejection of worldly goods, admonition against materialism, and elevation of the life of poverty. Yet some balance comes in the biblical condemnation of sloth—specifically in a context of not making profit—in the parable of the talents.26 Moreover, component aspects of bourgeois virtue and dignity, such as fidelity, temperance, and honesty, are plainly consistent with if not derived from Christian ethics. Similarly, both bourgeois dignity's egalitarianism and the associated expansion of the class of individuals considered dignified that we witness in this era seem in keeping with—indeed, are most likely derived from—a Christian understanding of the basic equality of man, as equally created by God.27 Finally, the Weberian theory of the Protestant ethic's essential role in the economic success of Protestant countries during capitalism's early stages of development offers another interesting, though controversial, explanation of why England and the Low Countries were quicker to adopt bourgeois values than their continental and Catholic neighbors.

Three additional perspectives critical of the bourgeois way of life also deserve brief mention here. Working chronologically, the first is Jean-Jacques Rousseau's complaint from *The Discourse on the Arts and Sciences*, made as the bourgeoisie was beginning its ascent. Rousseau argues that, far from dignifying its practitioner, the bourgeois lifestyle and values destroy the individual's independence and happiness, as well as authentic relations among humans more generally. The bourgeois way of life was one of dependency and debasement, not independence and dignity. A similar objection about instrumentalizing others can be lodged against the bourgeois from a slightly later, Kantian perspective,

<sup>26</sup> E.g., Exod. 22:25–27, Lev. 25:36–37; Deut. 23:20–21; Ps. 15:5, but also Col. 3:5, Luke 12, and Matt. 5 and 14:30.

<sup>27</sup> For a different take, see Bonnie Kent's "Human Dignity after the Fall" in this volume.

though the Kantian universalization of human dignity may at least partly rest upon the extension of dignity to greater numbers of people in the bourgeois era.28 Finally, contemporary communitarians such as Robert Bellah and Robert Putnam charge that bourgeois dignity masks a selfishness and extreme individualism that erode the social bonds essential to a good life. According to communitarians, bourgeois society is one in which "community dissolves into the cash nexus, need is subordinated to profit, culture gives way to acquisition, leisure is sacrificed to work."29

## Shaping Culture and Dignifying the Bourgeoisie: *The Spectator*

One of the key texts that helped popularize and legitimize the idea of bourgeois dignity was Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's coffeehouse periodical *The Spectator*. Begun in March 1711, *The Spectator* ran six times a week and was immensely popular, with conservative estimates placing the number of each edition printed between three and four thousand—though also rising as high as fifteen thousand, depending on the topic—and Addison himself estimating that at least twenty people read any single printed copy. As stated in its opening number, the periodical's express purpose was to reform society, "to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality … [to] have brought Philosophy out of the Closets and Libraries."30 With an audience that was primarily urban and of the middling condition, *The Spectator* accepted commercial society as a given; rather than endeavoring to reorient the commercial way of life, it sought to direct the values and behaviors associated with commerce in the direction of what the

eighteenth century called "politeness," a complex notion encompassing both political and moral discourse, with an emphasis on moderation, toleration, and civility in the name of social harmony among diverse but interdependent groups. This understanding of politeness is associated culturally with a friendliness to commercial activity and values, and politically with Whig politics. Analyzing Addison as a moralist of politeness, Lawrence E. Klein notes that "politeness involved mutual deference and respect…. Politeness did not require agreement, but it did require a variety of restraints…. One had to talk in such a way as to allow the process of talking to continue, even if no agreement was ever reached."31 Conceptually, the politeness advanced by *The Spectator* is related to bourgeois dignity, in that norms of politeness acknowledged the legitimacy of all points of view. From this acknowledgment of equal legitimacy, a kind of leveling of the moral status of persons can be inferred. The leveling implicit in politeness works in both directions—a kind of "leveling up" of the lower classes, as well as a "leveling down" of the upper classes. Politeness is thus a process of bringing different classes and viewpoints into harmony with each other; because of this, polite society also offered a model of a tolerant civil society in which disagreement could be productive rather than destructive.

Formal and substantive aspects of *The Spectator* worked together to dignify the bourgeois virtues and to popularize the concept of bourgeois dignity. On a most basic level, *The Spectator*'s very goal of shaping popular culture—both behavior and the beliefs underpinning behavior—in directions that dignified the bourgeois way of life and the qualities associated with that way of life reflects and legitimizes the kind of pragmatism associated with bourgeois virtue. Even more obviously, the mingling of classes within the papers' fictional Spectator

Club embodies the kind of mixing necessary in commercial society, as well as the egalitarianism and independence characterizing the bourgeois worldview. With members including figures such as country squire Sir Roger de Coverley, businessman Sir Andrew Freeport, army officer Captain Sentry, and the Clergyman, the Spectator Club represents a public sphere in which contact between various classes is contact among equals. In the Spectator Club, the merchant's point of view is as respected as the aristocrat's, and exchange between points of view results in general improvement: the nobility is purged of folly and encouraged to partake of the bourgeois virtues, and the commercial class is polished and elevated, transforming it from the ordinary "cit" to the dignified bourgeoisie.

The Spectator Club itself is thus a small-scale embodiment of what came to be known as "coffeehouse society": a tolerant, inclusive, and egalitarian public sphere in which social classes mingled and discussed matters of policy, religion, and taste. Steele notes, "The Coffee-house is the Place of Rendezvous to all who live near it, who are thus turned to relish calm and ordinary Life," and it was home to a broadly democratic swath of—often self-fashioned—individuals who were productive, tolerant, and moderate, and who were considered by Addison and Steele as "the worthier Part of Mankind."32 The phenomenon of coffeehouse society is widely regarded as central to the shaping and diffusion of bourgeois identity and ideals, and as these bourgeois virtues came to be respected in the coffeehouse just as in the marketplace, greater dignity was accorded to the bourgeois person and his or her way of life.33 This process of dignifying the bourgeoisie, in turn, reinforced and heightened a new ethos of dignity, one that—while not yet

<sup>33</sup> The key text on coffeehouse society and bourgeois identity is Jürgen Habermas's *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society* (1962), trans Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 199). Habermas casts the coffeehouse as a public sphere between civil society and the state, in which discussion and debate of matters of common interest was guaranteed. This sphere emerged within the context of a market economy and developed into the locus of popular monitoring of state authority by the people.

universal—was more inclusive and more accessible than older notions of dignity.

In working to elevate the everyday, and to create and diffuse the concept of bourgeois dignity, Addison and Steele turn their attention to almost every quality associated with the bourgeois virtues, from the virtues closely associated with commerce to those that more generally frame and support commercial life, and from specific social characteristics to more general ideas related to the worth of the individual.

*The Spectator*'s praise of the qualities directly associated with commerce and perhaps the most explicit example of Addison and Steele's efforts to establish the concept of bourgeois dignity in the popular consciousness can be seen in the character of Sir Andrew Freeport.34 Simply by choosing to name the representative of commerce "Sir Andrew" rather than "Andrew," Addison and Steele ennoble and dignify the commercial way of life and the bourgeois virtues. Introducing Sir Andrew in the second paper, Steele describes him as "a Person of indefatigable Industry, strong Reason, and great Experience." Said to be "excellent company"—high praise in itself, given the centrality of sociability and politeness in *The Spectator*—and a worthy friend, Sir Andrew's thrift, diligence, and scrupulous honesty are emphasized in *The Spectator*'s opening portrait of him, as are his intelligence, judgment, probity, and lack of affectation. Elsewhere, his justice and fairness are singled out for praise, and he exemplifies the other qualities *Spectator* 283 cites as necessary for success in business: thrift, method, and order.

Sir Andrew, whose words are always heard by Mr. Spectator "with a particular Pleasure" and whose "Notions of Trade are noble and

<sup>34</sup> For direct praise of the commercial virtues, see, for example, *Spectator* nos. 193, 11, 174, 108, 257, and 287.

generous,"35 champions the benefits of the division of labor, advancing also a sophisticated understanding of the concept of interest that mirrors the rehabilitation of interest accompanying the rise of the bourgeoisie. In Sir Andrew's opinion, interest-based commerce enriches all trading partners and benefits the public as a whole, both by increasing the general standard of living and by usefully employing those who would otherwise be beggars. Through Sir Andrew, *The Spectator* argues that trade is a better source of power and national greatness than arms, asserting that commerce "knits" the various parts of the world together "in mutual intercourse" and that "true power is to be got by arts and industry."36 *The Spectator* is also careful to remind its readers of Sir Andrew's altruism and of the manner in which he uses his wealth to help and employ others, thus exposing readers again to the rehabilitation of self-interest, illustrating how what was once thought a vice could be a virtue serving the common interest and society's general improvement.37 Sir Andrew's example thus embodies of *The Spectator*'s view that "there are not more useful Members of the Commonwealth than merchants," and that their way of life is the "most advantageous" for the individual and for society as a whole.38

Looking beyond the portrait of Sir Andrew, the bourgeois virtues occupy privileged places in Addison and Steele's moral universe, with *The Spectator* touting their inherent desirability as well as the positive effects resulting from their possession or practice. Work and the virtue of industry receive generally high praise throughout *The Spectator*, with the papers repeatedly endorsing "honest industry" and the man of affairs.39 More particularly, Addison and Steele express a preference

for allowing younger sons to engage in commerce, in order to improve themselves and their condition, rather than idling away on country estates. *The Spectator* also asserts that work or industry has nonmaterial benefits, arguing that industry (together with simplicity, innocence, and temperance) is a better source of tranquility than wisdom, and that "men of business and bustle in the world" are often more likely to enjoy serenity of body and mind than are philosophers.40 Decency, too, is elevated to become "Concomitant to Virtue" and is associated with order, constancy, mutual respect across classes, and moderation of both speech and conduct. Together with sincerity, decency emerges in *The Spectator* as the standard against which the actions and speeches of the day are judged and found wanting. Addison and Steele also laud temperance, placing it among the virtues and associating it with the type of commercial life that benefits the merchant and society. As endorsed by *The Spectator*, temperance includes both bodily continence and a more general self-possession; thus, it is affiliated with sobriety in a literal sense and with the moderation or "Sobriety of the Heart" that is described as "above all Pleasures."41 Finally, *The Spectator* elevates the bourgeois "framing" virtues of marital fidelity and conjugal love, casting domestic felicity as complementing and enhancing external esteem and respect, and as making the happy spouse a more agreeable companion outside of the home.42

Just as *The Spectator*'s content works to elevate the bourgeois life and to diffuse the new notion of bourgeois dignity, Addison and Steele's method also underlines the standing and dignity they attribute to the bourgeoisie. Perhaps most obviously, *The Spectator* operates by persuasion rather than preaching, engaging its middle-class readers as equals in the discussion and participants in its project of advancing bourgeois dignity. In its efforts to refine judgment and to create new standards

of taste and behavior, *The Spectator* operates on intellectual, affective, and habitual levels, with each complimenting the other—reason being reinforced by the force of emotion and by practice, sensibility being refined by rational argument and given additional grounding through practice, and so on. Erin Mackie comments that because Addison and Steele sought to change thinking as well as behavior, it was essential "that these moral reforms be *internalized* by the readers, that readers be persuaded, not coerced, into freely electing these standards of taste and behavior as their own."43 The papers themselves, then, reflect the ideas of self-making, self-reliance, and independent judgment that we have seen are reflections and byproducts of the idea of bourgeois dignity.

*The Spectator*'s praise of the "agreeable man" reflects something similar about the dignity Addison and Steele ascribe to the bourgeois condition. Described as content with his own position and as sincere and honest with those above and below him, the agreeable man embodies what is pleasing to "the Generality of Mankind." He is contrasted with two extremes—those who lord it over others and those who abase themselves before others. Via this contrast, *Spectator* 280 makes clear that the essence of this agreeableness is a confidence and "sincerity" derived from the individual's recognition of the equal dignity of his or her own position in the world. Hence, the *Spectator* also condemns forms of agreeableness resulting from "an artful plan" as well as agreeableness resulting in servility or cunning; instead, it endorses the constancy of "honest Natures."44

That such natures are found in both sexes and that bourgeois dignity itself is accessible to both sexes is also indicated by the fact that *Spectator* addresses itself to women as well as to men. *Spectator* 10 highlights its female readers, saying, "There are none to whom this Paper will be more useful than the female World." Part of Addison and Steele's purpose in

deliberately cultivating a female audience seems to have been to show how empty lives devoted solely to fashion and vanity could be, and to induce women—as "reasonable creatures"—to engage in productive lives and in more serious forms of self-development and self-making.45 Indeed, the reforms to female education and female behavior advocated by Addison and Steele endeavor to cultivate judgment and to promote probity, moderation, seriousness, and self-possession among all classes of women, although admittedly still within a domestic context and still primarily with an eye to supporting the domestic harmony viewed as essential to peaceful life in modern society.

Despite its focus on the domestic sphere, this inclusion of women underlines the democratic or egalitarian aspect of the bourgeois dignity presented in the *Spectator*. For the authors of the *Spectator*, human nature does not differ according to one's position, and dignity inheres in the human condition. *Spectator* 70 bluntly asserts that "human nature is the same in all reasonable Creatures," making clear that reasonableness is found in all stations of life. The theme is echoed in *Spectator* 248's assertions that civic virtue and public spiritedness are attainable by and identical for all classes. Steele writes, "It is in every Man's Power in the World … not only to do Things worthy but heroic." He further praises a civil virtue founded on self-denial, asserting that "there is no one … but has Opportunities of exercising that noble Quality," before finally concluding that "Men of publick spirit differ rather in their Circumstances than their Virtue."46

While emphasizing the universality of human nature, *The Spectator* also reminds its readers of the role custom plays in creating artificial distinctions among men. Understood against a backdrop of universal human nature, custom can be seen as distorting nature and obscuring

from view the natural equality and inherent dignity of all men. In its project of elevating the ordinary life of the bourgeois, *The Spectator* works to correct these distortive customs and to encourage a culture in which natural equality among humans would be recognized and dignified.

Though its depiction of the coffeehouse itself and its praise of commercial life, *The Spectator* both shaped and reflected the cultural consequences of this new bourgeois ethos. The political consequences of this ethos would not be manifest for some time, but Addison and Steele were alert to them. Discussing the form of government "most conformable to the Equality that we find in Human Nature," *Spectator* 287 endorses a government of "Liberty, which exempts one Man from Subjection to another so far as the Order and Economy of Government will permit." A regime of liberty, which reflected individual equality and autonomy to pursue one's chosen ends with minimal interference, would include a mixed government with separated powers, bicameralism, and a weak executive.47 Such a regime was far from a reality when Addison penned the essay in 1712, but he and Steele already envisaged it as the political application of the concept of bourgeois dignity, which *The Spectator* worked to create and spread.
