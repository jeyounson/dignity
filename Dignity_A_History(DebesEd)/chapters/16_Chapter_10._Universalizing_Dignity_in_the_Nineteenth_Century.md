# Chapter 10: Universalizing Dignity in the Nineteenth Century

*Mika LaVaque-Manty*

In this chapter, I consider three instances in the universalization of dignity. To use a genealogical metaphor, we might call them snapshots from the family album of dignity. The first is about gender, the second about labor, and the third about race. These instances are not, in themselves, the junctures a historian might want to identify as the moment when something fundamentally changed, but they are examples, indeed exemplary moments. By describing what we see in those snapshots we can understand a little better how, in 1948, human dignity is enshrined as inherent in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when 150 years earlier the idea seemed audacious.

To explore the "universalization" of a moral or political value is to explore a process by which the value gains a certain "taken-forgrantedness." I use the awkward phrase of taken-for-grantedness to distinguish universalization from two other meanings the concept might have. For something to become universal in the sense I use it does not mean that everyone subscribes to the idea or that it is uncontroversial. That is, arguably, not true in 1948—nor even now. It also does not mean that everyone understands what the concept means. If that were the case, this volume would not be necessary. Rather, I mean something admittedly imprecise but intelligible. By mid-twentieth century, dignity has become universal in the sense that it is the leading game in town: to deny the idea that every human being deserves respect by virtue of his or her inherent dignity will raise more eyebrows and objections than to affirm it.

Universalization, then, means something about the general reception of the concept, not its scope. That is, if I say, "Every human being has inherent dignity," but almost everyone disagrees with me, the scope of my concept might be universal, but concept itself isn't. Indeed, many people did say things that seemed to imply a universal scope for human dignity, long before 1948. For example, when Abraham Lincoln writes to Albert Hodges in 1864, "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong," he can be seen as implying an inherent inviolability and respect-worthiness of human beings.1 But the view is far from universal. Indeed, he writes as the commander in chief in a brutal conflict, in which one side's raison d'être is the denial of Lincoln's position.

How do we get to universalization, then? Many philosophers would like to think it is through the power of the better argument. Historians, even those who do believe that ideas and values matter, often tell us it is more complicated. For example, Thomas Haskell has argued—albeit controversially—the combination of global trade and ordinary people's understanding that their behavior was part of the causal chain of slavery explains what popularized abolitionist sentiments in the nineteenth

century.2 Or, as James Oakes has argued, the contradictions between slave-owner ideology—"Slaves are inferior humans"—and policy codes of conduct that presupposed the same intellectual and physical competencies among African American slaves as among white Americans—made abolitionist critiques powerful.3

While these two examples do suggest that it is more than the power of the better argument that changes minds, they also suggest that *conceptions* of values matter. Conceptual change, then, the familiar domain of philosophers, need not be separate, and indeed might not be separable, from politics.

I begin this chapter on the universalization of human dignity with the examples involving slavery deliberately. If the Kantian principle, treat others as ends in themselves and never as means only, is one of the foundational moments of modern dignity, then a practice in which another is treated as a fungible piece of property is the starkest possible violation of the principle.4 Indeed, the problem of slavery sets the relevant backdrop for this chapter, by pointing to a central aspect of my argument: contingent political struggles are inseparable from the conceptual, philosophical questions of how dignity came to be universal.

The nineteenth century is a key period in this development. On the one hand, this is when the *idea* that dignity is an inherent feature of personhood begins to gain widespread expression. On the other hand, the idea was as yet far from universally recognized, as I already pointed out. Slavery is the starkest example of this shortfall, but it is but one of many illustrations that many nineteenth-century social and political practices effectively denied the recognition of inherent human dignity.

<sup>4</sup> This book appropriately challenges the centrality of Kant's thought in dignity talk, but Kant nevertheless remains important in any meaningful discussion of dignity.

If dignity grounds respect, as we tend to think it does, large swathes of humanity seemed to lack it in the nineteenth century: slaves whether race-based or other types of slavery—women, and all "the lower orders": workers, the poor, and the like.

Several philosophical questions motivate the exploration of dignity's universalization. Did the political struggles persuade people to discover what was there all along or did they create something new? Was dignity like DNA: an inseparable part of human makeup, simply in need of scientific sophistication—or "civilization"—to be discovered? Or was it like the knowledge and skills required to be a computer programmer: a contingent property that is both possible and necessary only when a certain degree of development has been achieved?

This chapter does not, maybe unfortunately, provide an answer to these questions. Instead, it explores these questions and argues, first, that they involve a philosophically interesting political paradox. Although our modern conception tends to view dignity as an *inherent* feature of personhood, universalizing the idea has had to rely on making *contingent* and *noninherent* attributes of persons the grounds for why someone should be regarded as having dignity. This is abstract; I will spell it out in more concrete detail below.

There is a further philosophically interesting tension in the claim of inherent dignity that emerged in the nineteenth century concerning the relation between its moral and political conceptions. If everyone has dignity, what exactly does that dignity entail a claim to? We might ask a variant of Amartya Sen's famous question, "Equality of what?": what kind of equality is the equality of dignity? I suggest, at least conjecturally, that the political disagreements around this question help solidify equal dignity as a *moral* property and *thereby* weaken its political bite. Nineteenth-century debates result in a tension between the arguments that equal dignity ought to entail political equality, on the one hand, and arguments that it actually justifies existing social and political hierarchies. That tension remains unsolved by the time dignity begins to be treated as universal; there is agreement only on dignity as a moral

standing, but not on what it entails politically. But if so, then it should not surprise us that, by 1948, equal human dignity gets enshrined as a universal right. It is not surprising—because what gets enshrined is not a radical political idea, but a far less controversial moral idea. Or so I will suggest.

I do not, of course, suggest that dignity as a kind of moral standing cannot be politically powerful. On the contrary, the discussions I will canvas here show it can be. Moreover, its value to civil rights movements after 1948—my symbolic cutoff year in this chapter—suggest it remains a powerful political resource. But, as we will also see, not a simple one.

Before we explore the three snapshots of gender, labor, and race, it will help first describe the general mechanism by which dignity becomes universalized at the exemplary moments.

A final quick word about terms. "Nineteenth century" in this chapter means something a little looser than the years 1801–1900. "The Long Eighteenth Century" is a familiar historical concept; for my purposes the nineteenth is also long, extending from the period after the French Revolution to the First World War.

## The Logic of the Politics of Dignity

The politics of dignity relies on the following strategic logic: using embedded values to *model* new values. For the modeling to have a chance of success, there have to be some possible grounds on which the introduction of the novelty might make sense. Because putting the matter like this is hopelessly abstract, consider the following example. I draw it from my prior work on a specific politics of respect around the problem of dueling.5

<sup>5</sup> Mika LaVaque-Manty, "Dueling for Equality: Masculine Honor and the Modern Politics of Dignity," *Political Theory* 34, no. 6 (2006): 715–40, doi:10.1177/0090591706291727. The example I discuss comes from Ute Frevert, *Men of Honour: A Social and Cultural History of the Duel* (Oxford: Polity Press, 1995).

In the nineteenth-century German university, dueling (largely its nonlethal variety) was the standard mode for male students to establish their extracurricular bona fides, their contemporary street cred. When the emancipation of Jews in Germany also led to the admission of Jews into universities and to the creation of Jewish student organizations, gentile student organizations banned dueling with Jews. This bit of anti-Semitism was just a small part of the thoroughgoing anti-Semitism that helped continue discriminatory practices, despite the official "emancipation."

Where things got interesting, however, was that occasionally, a Jewish student would challenge a gentile to a duel. The historical record is far from perfect on this score, but it is not difficult to imagine that general anti-Semitism often became particular in such a case, with the gentile refusing along the lines of, "You, Jew, are beneath my contempt. I don't fight with the likes of you." One key feature of dueling, since its emergence out of trial by combat in the late Middle Ages, was that duelers, by definition, were formal equals. The right to settle disputes with the extralegal means of a duel was a privilege originally accorded to warrior nobles. Thus, prior to the nineteenth century, to refuse to fight a duel with an unequal, that is, to acknowledge a challenge from him, would not have been surprising. Indeed, the history of dueling has plenty of anecdotes of "silly" challenges from unequals and of duels among those who were not entitled to them (such as craftsmen or, God forbid, women).

But by the nineteenth century, the haughty gentile's refusal may have sounded a bit hollow. Jews had been officially emancipated, after all: the law was that they were equals, at least in some respects. Similarly, the rhetoric of human equality at least since the French Revolution had been gaining ground. Jews were not universally recognized, but the idea that they *should* be recognized was in the air.

How did that make a difference? The status that a man would maintain by fighting a duel was his honor qua a courageous man willing to face physical peril. Sure, for the student duelers, the peril wasn't a

violent death, but generally just a scar (which had its positive externalities when it came to dating, historians tell us), but the idea of courage was there: a dueler was someone who was brave. So when a Jewish student challenged a gentile, and the gentile tried to dismiss him, the former might reply, "Ah, you are just a coward." Contained in that would have been a broader message, translated into twenty-first-century language: "You claim you don't see me as an equal. But it's reasonable of me to insist you treat me as one. And if you refuse, in this particular context, I probably should just conclude *you* don't deserve the respect you insist. So, *en garde*, you gutless wimp."

This, then, is what I mean by the strategy of using embedded values to model new values. The relationship of respect among existing equals—the embedded value that nobles, by virtue of their equal *status* were allowed to duel, for example—could be insisted on by political challengers: "Let us show that we, too, do actually have the character traits that earn you the respect you accord one another." Key here is that there is (*a*) an existing mode of respect that gets modeled to bring in new modes of respect and (*b*) some prior rhetoric that makes the demand intelligible, even if not automatically self-evident or universally accepted.

Let us express the logic in more theoretical language. Consider Stephen Darwall's helpful distinction between recognition respect and appraisal respect.6 Recognition respect is something I accord you simply on the basis of who you are, by virtue of your identity. Appraisal respect is something I accord you on the basis of how well you do something I care about. For example, suppose I am an academic snob who thinks philosophers, for whatever reason, are special. You sit next to me at a coffee shop or on an airplane. I'm inclined to ignore you while I mind my valuable business, until you pull out your computer and begin grading philosophy papers, or take out a page proofs for an

<sup>6</sup> Stephen L. Darwall, *The Second-Person Standpoint: Morality, Respect, and Accountability* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006), 120ff.

article in *Ethics*. I recognize you as a fellow philosopher before I know anything else about you and (for better or for worse) respect you as one. Contrast this to a domain where your ability to do something is the reason for my respect. Everyone and her uncle is a recreational runner these days, I might think, so my finding out that you run the occasional 5K does not much matter when I am introduced to you at a party. But when I discover that you run a 5K under sixteen minutes, which would make you a decent varsity-level collegiate athlete (and significantly faster than me), I suddenly accord you some new respect. This is based on my appraisal of your abilities, not on the recognition of who you are.

What I am proposing is an argumentative logic that challenges a neat division between recognition and appraisal respect. Instead, the idea is that recognition respect may be tied up in appraisal (I recognize you as a fellow honorable man *if* you demonstrate your courage) and that appraisal respect may at least on some occasions help establish recognition respect (I *can*, too, fight you at swords, so you'd better recognize me as an equal).

My discussion so far has been about respect, which is inherently connected to discussions of dignity. But it is not the same thing. So let us turn to how the logic I have described figures in the context of dignity.

## The Multivocality of Dignity

The premise of this chapter, like that of this entire book, is that dignity is not the same as equality, respect, worth, respect-worthiness, status, or standing, even though it is related, sometimes conceptually, sometimes practically, and sometimes even coextensively with one or more of these concepts. Another premise is that what matters is the *name* of the concept or, less philosophically, the word. My goal in this chapter is the very opposite of defining the concept or finding out or showing what it "really" means. Rather, I acknowledge that it is "multivocal": it can denote different, even opposite, but nevertheless related, things.

Let me elaborate. "Dignity" is multivocal in the sense that "liberal" is politically multivocal. Our explicitly political uses of the concept "liberal" are often confusing. In contemporary American political culture, it means someone who is on the political left. In theoretical (and contemporary European) use, it denotes someone committed to rights, free markets, limited government, and the rule of law so arguably the entire American political terrain. These differences aren't explained by homonymy, that is, by us having the same word for two entirely different things, such as "race" for a kind of contest and for a genetic grouping. They also aren't different conceptions of a single concept: if my conception of "justice" is fairness, I likely disagree with someone who understands justice to be "mutual advantage." I can endorse both conceptions of "liberal" as intelligible and acceptable uses in two related contexts. At the same time, both uses of liberal are closely related to politics, in the way another, now mainly obsolete use of "liberal" as someone who is free with money, is not. And we can tell a coherent story about the emergence of the two related meanings, likely having to do with American politics in the 1930s and 1040s.7

In popular nineteenth-century use, dignity frequently meant the kind of *positional* or *hierarchical* respectability it had meant for a long time and still means for us when we speak of "dignitaries": persons of high rank. But there was also significant variability in its use, suggesting that dignity could be both internal—you could feel it—and outward—others could ascribe it to you—and thereby inherently personal and not merely positional, depending on your place in a broader social context. In Henry Taylor's *The Statesman*, for example, dignity is in fact inherent: "A dignity which has to be contended for is not worth a quarrel; for it is of the essence of real dignity to be self-sustained, and

<sup>7</sup> I find John Gunnell's account a plausible one. John G. Gunnell, *Imagining the American Polity: Political Science and the Discourse of Democracy* (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004).

no man's dignity can be asserted without being impaired."8 The text is ironic—sarcastic, even—and the backdrop is clearly the practice in which people *do* insist on their dignity. By contrast, consider another example three decades later: in Anthony Trollope's 1870s masterpiece *The Way We Live Now*, the concept of dignity plays many roles. Here, "dignity" attaches to socially recognized honors and gender, with different conceptions of what counts as dignity depending on those social markers. Correspondingly, the demands of dignity vary with the context:

Mr. Melmotte on that morning had many visitors, among whom one of the earliest and most unfortunate was Mr. Longestaffe. At that time there had been arranged at the offices in Abchurch Lane a mode of double ingress and egress,—a front stairs and a back stairs approach and exit, as is always necessary with very great men,—in reference to which arrangement the honour and dignity attached to each is exactly contrary to that which generally prevails in the world; the front stairs being intended for everybody, and being both slow and uncertain, whereas the back stairs are quick and sure, and are used only for those who are favoured.9

At issue here is the uneasy relationship the old notables have with the new: aristocratic status gets you access to the new power—money which Mr. Melmotte represents, and which is supposed to be egalitarian and meritocratic. At the same time, because this is access to people the old notables should not be seen rubbing elbows with—Mr. Melmotte is a foreigner and might even be a Jew!—the access needs to be secret. Hence the back stairs.

<sup>9</sup> Anthony Trollope, *The Way We Live Now* (Empire Books, 2013), Kindle ed., chap. 53.

Dignity is also behavioral: "The father very slowly, and with much dignity of deportment, opened the drawer."10 It is positional and gendered. Fathers, in other words, have a dignity in relationship toward their children, especially daughters, which even the ineffectual Mr. Longestaffe, the father here, must try to maintain: "At a sudden burst he could stand upon his authority, and assume his position with parental dignity."11 And, finally, women have a particular dignity. For example, Hetta Carbury, one of the heroines of the novel, is unhappy at the dishonesty of Paul Montague, one of the (almost) heroes of the book:

It is hoped that the reader need hardly be informed that Hetta Carbury was a very miserable young woman as soon as she decided that duty compelled her to divide herself altogether from Paul Montague. I think that she was irrational; but to her it seemed that the offence against herself,—the offence against her own dignity as a woman,—was too great to be forgiven.12

From Hetta's perspective—whether correct or not—Paul has been untruthful about his actions and, specifically, has had a relationship with another woman. Now, to be cheated on was and still is a moral wrong, regardless of gender. That is, as a form of deceit, it is not only a textbook violation of the general duty of truthfulness, it also violates the respect and trust lovers or potential lovers should maintain toward one another, in particular. However, this moral violation of special duties of truthfulness is only part of what is going on in Hetta's case. There is also a gendered dimension of dignity in play. Women's *honor* is agentic and requires remaining chaste, but women's *dignity* is not agentic. It depends on the respectability of "their" men. That is

<sup>10</sup> Trollope, *The Way We Live Now*, chap. 75.

<sup>11</sup> Trollope, *The Way We Live Now*, chap. 21.

<sup>12</sup> Trollope, *The Way We Live Now*, chap. 84.

why Hetta is so angry. Her dignity is harmed by the actions of another agent, "her" man.

This ambiguity between gendered dignity and dignity is general is one of the first dimensions in the multivocality of dignity that begins to be used politically. This is well illustrated by that quintessential argument on gender inequality, Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Woman*.

## Fixing "False" Dignity

Unlike the Taylor play or the Trollope novel, which I selected as convenient examples of broader nineteenth-century uses of dignity, Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Woman* is not a random example of the shifting discourse of dignity. Though written in the 1790s, it shapes much of the discussion that follows in the nineteenth century, not to mention its contemporaries. Written as a companion of sorts to her now lesser-known *Vindication of the Rights of Man*, it is Wollstonecraft's engagement with contemporary events and her contemporaries: the French Revolution, most urgently, but also Edmund Burke's rejection of the Revolution in what is now the founding statement of classical conservatism, *Reflections on the Revolution in France*, as well, most importantly, with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was often seen as having helped bring about the French Revolution. In other words, Wollstonecraft takes on both the opponents of the Revolution and those who sympathized with it or whose views could be seen as sympathetic.13

For Wollstonecraft, dignity is one of the key concepts in this undertaking. She affirms the concept of dignity as valuable when she criticized Rousseau for implying that civilization is all a sham: "A curse it might be reckoned, if the whole of our existence were bounded by our

<sup>13</sup> Rousseau had died before the Revolution, so he can't be called a supporter, despite the arguments of the Revolution's opponents.

continuance in this world; for why should the gracious fountain of life give us passions, and the power of reflecting, only to imbitter our days and inspire us with mistaken notions of dignity?"14 Wollstonecraft does agree with Rousseau that civilization is, in many ways, in a sorry state and that existing positions of "supreme dignity" are in fact the result of "vile intrigues, unnatural crimes, and every vice that degrades our nature."15 Yet dignity *is* a meaningful concept. Her goal is not to eliminate it, or to throw "away the wheat with the chaff," which she says Rousseau did, but to get it right, especially with regard to gender:

I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists—I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonimous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.16

There exists, in other words, "true" dignity, here glossed as strength of mind and body. This true dignity is not positional or role dependent. The "supreme dignity" that people acquire through the vile intrigues is one example of false dignity. "Women's dignity" is another. As she points out, the characteristics that are associated with feminine dignity are, on sober reflection, characteristics of weakness and thereby not grounds of respect-worthiness, but its opposite, contempt.

Importantly, though, true dignity is not inherent. Persons don't have it by virtue of their personhood; it is acquired. And, to use

<sup>14</sup> Mary Wollstonecraft, *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 1997), 120.

<sup>15</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 122.

<sup>16</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 111.

Wollstonecraft's eighteenth-century term, it is therefore an acquirement: a product of cultivation. Although Wollstonecraft mentions the strength of both mind *and* body, the focus of her book is on the mind (as is true of much of the feminist advocacy that followed). The reason, too, is obvious: First, intellectual prowess is likely more important in effecting mobility through social hierarchies, especially in the context of Enlightenment rhetoric about the value of reason. Second, it is the denial of women's intellectual prowess that critics from Wollstonecraft onward seize on as the most persistent and damaging mode of oppression, however well intentioned:

Into this error men have, probably, been led by viewing education in a false light; not considering it as the first step to form a being advancing gradually towards perfection; but only as a preparation for life. On this sensual error, for I must call it so, has the false system of female manners been reared, which robs the whole sex of its dignity, and classes the brown and fair with the smiling flowers that only adorns the land.17

Finally, although there *are* physical differences between the sexes that might make a social or political difference, of course we know now and, I would argue, Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries knew then, however inchoately—there are no intellectual differences between the sexes. So although dignity is not inherent, the *potential* for it is. And even if there were people around who denied the universal potential, Wollstonecraft's argument for the potential is a first step in the universalization of the idea of dignity.

We see this logic throughout the nineteenth century, even if we don't see the specific concept of dignity used in the arguments. In the United States, for example, the Seneca Falls declaration in 1848 for women's

<sup>17</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 167.

suffrage turns on it. Women's right to vote has been denied because they aren't seen as competent for citizenship. The signatories of the declaration—Elizabeth Cady Stanton perhaps most prominent among them—argue they are. Or consider John Stuart and Harriet Taylor Mill's formulation of a similar argument, framed as one of the "experiments" John Stuart Mill had advocated in his *On Liberty*: we haven't yet tried the experiment of treating women on an equal footage, so let us try it now, the Mills argue in midcentury. In all such cases, the goal is to show that problematic conceptions of capacity and potential, whether of women or of some other undervalued group, are simply contingent and that all people do have the capacities and potential, if properly cultivated.

Put this way, dignity talk might reasonably disappear. Arguments purely for equality, or equality of opportunity, might suffice. And if dignity is, as Wollstonecraft's formulation suggests, an acquirement, equal respect would appropriately remain a form of appraisal respect, to be bestowed on those who deserve it. But, I suggest, there is another way of thinking about dignity. This other way will be the seed that helps establish the inherency of equal dignity. It is the argument about work.

## Dignity of Labor?

"Dignity of labor" refers to the idea that *all* work is respectable and therefore respect-worthy. The idea wasn't born in the nineteenth century; its roots are much earlier in Christian thought. Consider, for example, this stanza from George Herbert's "The Elixir" (1633):

> A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine: Who sweeps a room as for Thy Laws, Makes that and th' action fine.18

<sup>18</sup> George Herbert, *The Temple* (Menston, Yorkshire: Scolar Press, 1968).

Here the dignity of the work arises from the disposition of the worker: imbuing the activity of work as reverence toward God gives work its value.

Older though the idea is, it isn't a coincidence that the nineteenth century sees the concept revived. Industrial Revolution, the emergence of the labor movement in many variants, and broader politics of equality made work not just a political, but also a conceptual, battleground. The politics are complicated, however. The least surprising position, embraced by some labor movements from the nineteenth century on, is the demand for respect for workers on the grounds of the inherent dignity of labor. *Any* work, and therefore any worker, deserves respect, and the treatment that goes with it, the argument goes.

Interestingly, some influential advocates of political equality for the working class reject this idea. For the most famous theorist of the working classes, the concept of dignity is not relevant: it doesn't play a role in Marx's political philosophy, and his main argument about the alienating effect of industrial work is a far cry from the dignity of labor. But more relevant for our purposes is the French socialist anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's argument because it arrives at a conclusion somewhat similar to Marx's, but by invoking dignity.

For Proudhon, the conditions of some work—modern, industrial, poorly paid work—not only lack dignity, but they deprive their practitioners of dignity. In his *System of Economical Contradictions, or the Philosophy of Misery* (1846), Proudhon says,

The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, says the Gospel, and the violent take it by force. These words are the allegory of society. In society regulated by labor, dignity, wealth, and glory are objects of competition; they are the reward of the strong, and competition may be defined as the regime of force.19

<sup>19</sup> Pierre Joseph Proudhon, *System of Economical Contradictions, or the Philosophy of Misery* (Cambridge: John Wilson and Son, 1888), available at http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ ugcm/3ll3/index.html, chap. 2.

Elsewhere in the same text, he makes it clear that the working classes do indeed appear *not* to be respect-worthy, but that their respectworthiness has little to do with work: The "eternal babble of the economists about the improvidence of laborers, their idleness, their want of dignity, their ignorance, their debauchery, their early marriages, etc." is a result of the oppressive conditions in which they find themselves, not for the lack of meaningful engagement. Education won't do the trick; the combination of labor and education, for Proudhon, is nothing other than a recipe for misery because it reveals to the worker the indignity of his condition. Perhaps most interestingly, the desire for luxury, so strenuously denied to the workers by prohibitive taxation and the paternalism of the ruling classes, may be one of the small chances at dignity the lower orders might have: "It is the taste for luxury which in our day, in the absence of religious principles, sustains the social movement and reveals to the lower classes their dignity."20

Proudhon's use of "dignity" is still ambiguous. Is he being ironic and sarcastic here? (He frequently is.) Is he using it in the superficial way that Taylor and Trollope occasionally do, referring to the outward appearance of respectability, as opposed to respect-worthiness? I suggest not. In fact, I suggest we read him as articulating a conception of dignity that is inherent and universal; for elsewhere he explicitly invokes the Kantian conception, whereby persons, by virtue of their personhood (and *not* by virtue of their role, action, or place in an institution) have dignity.21

To be clear, Proudhon's argument does not follow the logic I articulated above, namely, a conceptual inversion that succeeds at making something previously disrespected an object of respect. Indeed, that he did *not* use this logic is the reason Proudhon's argument had less

<sup>20</sup> Proudhon, *System of Economical Contradictions*. About a century later, George Orwell echoes this same sentiment when he castigates upper-class lefties for their contemptuous paternalism toward the poor: the desire for unhealthy luxuries may be one of the claims for human dignity the poor have. See George Orwell, *The Road to Wigan Pier* (San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1958), 99.

purchase among his contemporaries than, say, Marx's—though it is beyond this chapter to substantiate this point. That said, Proudhon's argument did help keep the question of the dignity of labor alive, albeit in a way he would have lamented. And here we arrive at a third complicated position about the dignity of labor.

It is a Christian, I want to suggest, who plays a key catalyzing role in universalizing the concept of the dignity of labor. Pope Leo XIII's influential papal encyclical *Rerum Novarum, or the Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor* (1891) enters directly into the nineteenth-century political conversation about the antagonism between classes. We might call Leo's position conciliatory; he condemns what the advocates of the working classes would call exploitation. The claim invokes dignity explicitly: "The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer: not to look upon their work people as their bondsmen, but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character."22 Here, dignity is no longer merely attached to work, but to personhood. But the political implications are not at all the same as for Proudhon. Considerations of dignity, in part, ground the right of state intervention into labor disputes. I quote Leo here at length:

If by a strike of workers or concerted interruption of work there should be imminent danger of disturbance to the public peace; or if circumstances were such as that among the working class the ties of family life were relaxed; if religion were found to suffer through the workers not having time and opportunity afforded them to practice its duties; if in workshops and factories there were danger to morals through the mixing of the sexes or from other harmful occasions of evil; or if employers laid burdens upon their workmen which were unjust, or degraded them with conditions repugnant to their dignity as human beings; finally, if health were endangered by excessive

labor, or by work unsuited to sex or age—in such cases, there can be no question but that, within certain limits, it would be right to invoke the aid and authority of the law.23

Again, workers have dignity "as human beings." And there are things that would violate that dignity: unjust burdens and other "repugnant conditions." The state, in short, is permitted to prevent those injustices and protect the dignity of the workers.

But workers are also bound in what they may do. Strikes are not a violation of employers'—or apparently anybody's—dignity, but they are socially disruptive and therefore also subject to state intervention. The message is a clear rejection of radical political advocacy. The implied message and, I want to suggest, the legacy of this way of thinking about dignity is that the inherent dignity of persons *limits* its political power. Dignity is what philosophers call a "side constraint": something that limits what may be done to persons but, *because it is already there, in everyone's personhood*, not a ground on which to demand a fundamental change of status.

## Conclusion

So far, I have considered the conceptual snapshots of gender and labor; one remains. There is one kind of status that is *tout court* inconsistent with inherent human dignity. This chapter began with the example of slavery, and Leo's language of bondsmen reminds us—and certainly it reminded his nineteenth-century contemporaries—of the relatively recent end of slavery. We might call the consequence of Leo XIII's treatment of dignity its depolicitization. The depoliticization of dignity may have limited the concept's usefulness for the politics of labor, but not for all politics. That the language of inherent dignity emerges in the century of abolition is not a coincidence.

Let us go back some decades from Leo XIII and consider one of the most powerful and eloquent critics of slavery, Frederick Douglass. Consider a passage from Douglass's autobiography. This is on his first visit to the North, and he is trying to make sense of the differences he observes between the slave-owning South and the North. On visiting New Bedford harbor, where he marvels at the wealth and the large ships, he writes:

Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the labourer. I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, *as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man*. 24

Contrast this to his calling out white Americans' hypocrisy in the 1851 speech "What to the Slave is the 4th of July?": "You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor."25 Sure, he suggests, there is dignity in labor *if the inherent dignity of the human being is respected*.

How do we get to 1948 from Douglass? I have suggested that he, like Wollstonecraft, Proudhon, and Leo, helps the world understand the concept in a new way. But why 1948? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is, as I suggested earlier, a nonarbitrary but still not *the* key event in the universalization of dignity. I have not said anything

about the early decades of the twentieth century, during which the conception of inherent dignity slowly, or "secretly," spreads, even making its way to constitutions, such as Ireland's in the 1930s.26 So I might just walk away from the historical context of the Declaration with no remark about either the Holocaust or about the Cold War. But I want to end with an observation about the politics of the context.

It is certainly true that the Holocaust makes it possible for the Declaration to get the kind of support it does, but the Cold War grounds its content. What I might call the Catholic conception can serve as a convenient resource in the context of the Cold War. That conception affirms the dignity of humanity *and* labor while, at the same time, undercutting broader political claims about the exploitation of work—just the kinds of claims the Soviet bloc was making against the West. Understanding work as inherently dignified is a powerful counter to a moralized Marxist rhetoric, which sees wage labor by itself as a moral evil.

This chapter is not a piece of twentieth-century history, so I will not try to answer the historical question of whether such a tension about conceptions of labor existed around the framing of the Declaration. Real historians have already worked on it. But it is a feature of my chapter to admit that such a tension may indeed play a significant role in the framing. This has to do with the originally Christian depoliticization of the concept of dignity. The concept remains a moral one, but with less obvious political consequences after the end of slavery. In other words, it may be the depolicitization, as I have suggested, that makes the concept's occurrence appealing *and* palatable to the Cold War partisans.

The above is not a cynical conclusion. Cold War legacy notwithstanding, the universalization of dignity is far from meaningless, and the depoliticization in terms of labor is not a total depolicitization. How

do we know? Just think of political struggles that emerge at the time or shortly after the Declaration. Whether Indian independence from Britain or the US civil rights movement, the political arguments—in addition to always necessary political action—that ground the movements often implicitly and sometimes explicitly invoke the idea of universal human dignity.
