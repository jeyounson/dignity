# Series Foreword

Oxford Philosophical Concepts (OPC) offers an innovative approach to philosophy's past and its relation to other disciplines. As a series, it is unique in exploring the transformations of central philosophical concepts from their ancient sources to their modern use.

OPC has several goals: to make it easier for historians to contextualize key concepts in the history of philosophy, to render that history accessible to a wide audience, and to enliven contemporary discussions by displaying the rich and varied sources of philosophical concepts still in use today. The means to these goals are simple enough: eminent scholars come together to rethink a central concept in philosophy's past. The point of this rethinking is not to offer a broad overview, but to identify problems the concept was originally supposed to solve and investigate how approaches to them shifted over time, sometimes radically. Recent scholarship has made evident the benefits of re-examining the standard narratives about western philosophy. OPC's editors look beyond the canon and explore their concepts over a wide philosophical landscape. Each volume traces a notion from its inception as a solution to specific problems through its historical transformations to its modern use, all the while acknowledging its historical context. Each OPC volume is a history of its concept in that it tells a story about changing solutions to its well-defined problem. Many editors have found it appropriate to include long-ignored writings drawn from the Islamic and Jewish traditions and the philosophical contributions of women. Volumes also explore ideas drawn from Buddhist, Chinese, Indian, and other philosophical cultures when doing so adds an especially helpful new perspective. By combining scholarly innovation with focused and astute analysis, OPC encourages a deeper understanding of our philosophical past and present.

One of the most innovative features of OPC is its recognition that philosophy bears a rich relation to art, music, literature, religion, science, and other cultural practices. The series speaks to the need for informed interdisciplinary exchanges. Its editors assume that the most difficult and profound philosophical ideas can be made comprehensible to a large audience and that materials not strictly philosophical often bear a significant relevance to philosophy. To this end, each OPC volume includes "reflections." These are short, stand-alone essays written by specialists in art, music, literature, theology, science, or cultural studies that reflect on the concept from their own disciplinary perspectives. The goal of these essays is to enliven, enrich, and exemplify the volume's concept and reconsider the boundary between philosophical and extraphilosophical materials. OPC's reflections display the benefits of using philosophical concepts and distinctions in areas that are not strictly philosophical, and encourage philosophers to move beyond the borders of their discipline as presently conceived.

The volumes of OPC arrive at an auspicious moment. Many philosophers are keen to invigorate the discipline. OPC aims to provoke philosophical imaginations by uncovering the brilliant twists and unforeseen turns of philosophy's past.

# Acknowledgments

Five years ago, Christia Mercer casually asked me over dinner what I'd choose to investigate, were I were to contribute to her (then) new series of books, Oxford Philosophical Concepts. I hadn't anticipated the question, and yet my reply was immediate. "Dignity."

The truth is, I had already been mulling over the idea of writing a history of human dignity. I had been working on the subject since 2006, but with a growing dissatisfaction over the lack of any concerted historical treatment of the concept. However, I had also concluded that it was foolish to think I could write dignity's history by myself. I had wanted to write the history of dignity from its origins: From ancient honor cultures and Greco-Roman philosophical ethics, through early Christian, Islamic, and medieval theology, across the revolutionary eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, right up to the doorstep of our contemporary worldview. But to do that myself, and to do it well, ended up seeming like hubris to me. The history of dignity needed a collection of scholars with an array of languages and specializations. And thus it was a stroke of high fortune to have met Christia Mercer when I did. She gave me the opportunity to produce what I alone could not make possible. I owe her a debt I cannot repay, though I hope the book before you proves some reward for her faith in my vision, her wise guidance, and her unfailing encouragement over the intervening years.

For similar reasons I am indebted to the authors of this volume. It is their expertise and creative talents, as well as their admirable patience, that made this book possible. Moreover, many of the authors willingly traveled to the University of Memphis for a workshop during the drafting stage. I am grateful for this extra effort, which led to many invaluable improvements in all our work. I am likewise grateful to the Department of Philosophy at the University of Memphis for its generous support of this workshop and to the various students and faculty from Memphis who participated in it.

I owe a special debt to Peter Ohlin at Oxford University Press for adding his enthusiasm for this project to mine, and to his entire team for their support and practical advice during the publishing process. I'm grateful to Andy Britton for assistance with the index, and to my colleagues at the University of Memphis for their steady encouragement of my work on human dignity over the years, especially Stephan Blatti, Bill Lawson, John Tienson, and Deb Tollefsen. I also wish to give special thanks to Simone Zurbuchen, Christian Maurer, and the Université de Lausanne for organizing the 2014 conference, "Dignity, Respect, and Esteem in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Moral Philosophy before Kant," which afforded me the opportunity to present a full draft of my own chapter. I received excellent feedback, especially from my fellow presenters Lisa Broussois, Knud Haakonssen, James A. Harris, Christian Maurer, James Moore, Michael Seidler, Jacqueline Taylor, and Simone Zurbuchen. An unplanned post dinner discussion with Knud Haakonssen over generously sized beers was especially valuable. My chapter also benefited during its final stages from written feedback from Charles Griswold, Ryan Hanley, and Christia Mercer. And, of course, I am grateful to my wife and daughters for their encouragement of all my work, but also their priceless ability to whisk me away from the realities of this work, and give my mind a chance to rest.

Finally, I am grateful to the real historical champions of human dignity—to the men and women who, often at great, even ultimate risk, pressed into the world's conscience an ever greater appreciation of equal human worth. My greatest hope is that this book will somehow aid in this cause. However, I confess a new anxiety over the prospects of these lofty ambitions. Writing these acknowledgments, at the close of 2016, and looking into a suddenly uncertain future, I worry we shall witness an erosion of social justice in precisely those areas where human dignity is most salient. I thus close with a kind of promissory acknowledgment: for all those who, in the years to come, will ensure that the cry of human dignity is never silenced, I am humbly, and deeply, grateful.
