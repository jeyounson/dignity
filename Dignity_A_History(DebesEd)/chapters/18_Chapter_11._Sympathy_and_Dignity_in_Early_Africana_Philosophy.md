# Chapter 11: Sympathy and Dignity in Early Africana Philosophy

*Bernard Boxill*

Sympathy's vital importance in human affairs is perhaps the major theme of *The Souls of Black Folk*, W. E. B. Du Bois's great collection of essays first published in 1903. Throughout the collection, Du Bois lamented the want of sympathy between people and their consequent failure to recognize their equal humanity in each other. Indeed, at one point he contended that this failure, not poverty, or wickedness, or ignorance, was the "tragedy of the age."1 More positively, citing events in the nineteenth century for support, he suggested that an enhanced sympathy flourishing between more and more people would help lead to urgently needed social reforms, especially those related to the treatment of blacks in America.2 And in "Of Alexander Crummell,"

the twelfth essay in the collection, he crafted his "tale" of Alexander Crummell's life specifically to enhance the sympathy of his white readers for Crummell—the tacit suggestion being that sympathizing with Crummell would move them to *respect* Crummell and in turn, presumably, other black people. Du Bois seemed confident that he had succeeded in this project, exulting near the end of his tale that he had swept aside the "Veil" that kept the races apart, finally enabling white people to see the "mighty inspiration" in Crummell.3

In fact Du Bois failed in this primary project to create a transformative tale for his white readers. However, he succeeded in a second, unstated project, namely, to enhance sympathy for Crummell in his *black* readers. Moreover, and crucially, through that sympathy, Du Bois helped his black readers to prevail in their struggles, including the struggle to achieve dignity. Since this project was practical rather than theoretical, Du Bois refrained from presenting an analysis of dignity with argument and counterargument, relying instead on relating incidents in Crummell's life that would show him experiencing sentiments that would infuse sympathy into his black readers and lead them to dignity. Thus he showed Crummell fighting losing battles against the forces bent on frustrating his efforts to lead his people out of bondage; tempted sorely by hate, despair, and doubt; driven into wandering the world in search of knowledge of himself; and finally after twenty years returning home from Africa triumphant over his temptations. Crummell had sought knowledge of himself and had found it, discovering that it was knowledge of his duties. And that knowledge and his journey to it had given him a dignity that Du Bois immediately recognized and acknowledged on their first meeting, "instinctively" bowing before him, thus ratifying his dignity with the gesture that "dignity commands," as the philosopher Aurel Kolnai once said.4

I will spend some time on the idea of an enhanced sympathy since it is crucial to understanding the fates of Du Bois's two projects. In the first section, I present Du Bois's account of an enhanced sympathy, which I call "Du Boisian sympathy," as a special case of David Hume's account of sympathy. In the second section, I use Frederick Douglass's discussion of the reformative possibilities of slave singing to emphasize the difficulties of achieving Du Boisian sympathy. In the third section, I explain why Du Bois's first project was probably unsuccessful, though his second project fared better. And in the fourth and final section, I suggest what I think we can learn about Du Bois's conception of dignity from the sentiments that an enhanced sympathy would transfuse into his black readers from his tale of Crummell's life.

## Sympathy

"The nineteenth century," Du Bois wrote, "was the first century of human sympathy,—the age when half wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark of divinity that we call Myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and tramps and thieves, and millionaires and—sometimes—Negroes, became throbbing souls, whose warm pulsing life touched us so nearly that we half gasped with surprise, crying, 'Thou too! Hast Thou seen Sorrow and the dull waters of Hopelessness? Hast Thou known Life?' And then all helplessly we peered into these Other-worlds, and wailed, 'O World of Worlds, how shall man make you one?'"5

What exactly is "sympathy," for Du Bois? He never offers an explicit explanation; indeed the foregoing passage is the longest single statement he makes. So some reconstruction is in order. Obviously, Du Bois understands sympathy to be mostly, or at least most importantly, about the transmission of sorrow and its associated sentiments like

<sup>5</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 136.

disappointment, hopelessness, and a sense of helplessness and alienation. Du Bois was deeply impressed by the reformative power of these sentiments. Sorrow, especially the sorrow of the slaves, is foregrounded throughout *The Souls of Black Folk*, a fact made particularly plain by the bars and verses of the "sorrow songs" (slave songs) that Du Bois placed at the start each chapter. More to the point, the yearning for "oneness" that Du Bois expresses in the passage above suggests his agreement with Rousseau's claim that "we are attracted to our fellows less by the sentiments of our pleasures than by the sentiments of our pains, for we see far better in the latter the identity of our natures with theirs."6

And yet Du Boisian sympathy is not Rousseau's pity. For Rousseau, the pitier enjoys both the pity he has for the ills of those he pities, and the happiness that exempts him from those ills.7 Rousseau therefore described pity as "sweet" since the pitier is always exempt—at least for the period that he pities—from the ills of those he pities. Du Bois could not similarly describe sympathy as sweet. The people who share it always feel sorrow for the same ill—namely, of never being exempt from *any* ill. On Du Bois's account of sympathy, if people reflect deeply on the common condition they are in, they will see that it can be ameliorated only if they come together as one; that is, if they acknowledge their equal humanity and cooperate with each other on equal terms. Consequently, although Du Boisian sympathy and Rousseauian pity are both designed to be reformative, they evidently work in different ways.

In the long passage quoted above, Du Bois did not mean of course that sympathy started in the nineteenth century. His claim that "the nineteenth century was the first century of human sympathy" was followed immediately by the claim that only in the nineteenth century did "we" begin to descry ourselves in "others," whom he then

<sup>7</sup> See Rousseau, *Emile*, 229.

immediately identified as "clodhoppers and peasants, and tramps and thieves, and millionaires and—sometimes—Negroes." If his "we" in the claim refers to the majority of people in America and Britain ordinary middle-class white people—his point seems to have been that, although sympathy transmitted sorrow *among* middle-class whites before the nineteenth century, in that century it began to transmit *to* whites a new sorrow, namely, of clodhoppers, peasants, tramps, thieves, millionaires, and sometimes Negroes. Du Boisian sympathy is therefore a special kind of "widened" or "enhanced" sympathy, in the sense that it transmits sorrow among more people than it had before. We may understand it as a special case of Humean sympathy. I summarize Hume's account as follows: (1) The contents of our minds are divided into ideas and impressions, where impressions are the livelier, psychologically more forceful versions of ideas, and, importantly, include the passions; (2) there are cases where someone says or does something that "signals" to us that she is experiencing a certain passion; (3) in these cases, we form an idea of that passion; (4) that is because the impression we have of ourselves—literally, the lively feeling or sense of *self* that is in the background of our consciousness—transmits some of its vivacity *into* the very idea we formed of her passion; (5) by this transmission our idea of her passion *becomes* an impression of her passion—that is, it becomes a passion itself; (6) consequently, we feel her passion; (7) finally, this whole process is greatly enhanced by any resemblances we observe between ourselves and the person who is the object of our sympathy.8 This last step is crucial to explaining how sympathy can be widened to become Du Boisian sympathy.

So consider further Hume's claim that when "there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy."9 Hume reasoned that, if the resemblance

<sup>8</sup> Hume delivers his basic account of sympathy in *Treatise*, 2.1.11. David Hume, *A Treatise of Human Nature*, ed. David Fate Norton and Mary J. Norton (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).

<sup>9</sup> Hume, *Treatise*, 2.1.11, 207.

of our natures—ours and whoever is the object of our sympathetic attention—helps our impression of self transmit its vivacity into our idea of the other person's passion, then it will more easily transmit its vivacity to that idea *whenever* the "general resemblance of our natures" is strengthened. But then it also seems to follow that we can deliberately widen people's sympathy by deliberately increasing their resemblance to one another. Alternatively, since it is recognized resemblances that support and sustain sympathy, it must be possible to deliberately *remove* factors that have been distracting people's attention from any resemblances they have to each other.

Working a century after Hume, the black nationalist Martin Delany appealed to Hume's view of the importance of resemblance for the operation of sympathy in order to explain why slaves in the Americas were overwhelmingly black. Focusing on the differences in skin color and character of hair between Europeans and Africans, and noting that such differences were "as strongly marked in the colored people as in the Indians," he argued that, as in the case of the Indians, those differences made Africans "foreign to the sympathies of the invaders of the continent" and in turn helped to account for their selection as slaves.10 More generally, Delany claimed that those who proscribe others "select as the objects of their proscription, those who differed as much as possible, in some particulars, from themselves. This is to ensure the greater success, because it engenders the greater prejudice, or in other words, elicits less interest on the part of the oppressing class, in their favor."11 Delany was not suggesting that hatred of the color black motivated white people to enslave black people, or ignoring the economic motives for slavery. His point was that, given that white people were motivated to enslave other people for profit, they would enslave people who least

resembled them because, in accordance with Hume's view, sympathy would be less likely to make them share the sorrows of their slaves.

But widened Humean sympathy still falls short of Du Boisian sympathy. Surprise evidently always accompanies Du Boisian sympathy, but surprise need not accompany widened Humean sympathy unless, absurdly, people signaling sorrow also always signal surprise. So something further is needed to make sense of Du Bois's argument. Hume's compatriot Adam Smith tells us surprise is the emotion we feel from the unexpectedness of feeling another emotion.12 So perhaps surprise accompanies Du Boisian sympathy because a widened sympathy carries the passions of people whose passions were not expected. But if people ceaselessly receive sentiments from each other via sympathy, then it seems unlikely that the *mere receipt* of sentiments from people, even if for the first time, would occasion surprise. Nor will the mere receipt of any *particular* sentiment, which a widened sympathy transmits, be unexpected. Everyone knows *that* everyone else feels sorrow, joy, anguish, happiness, fear, and so on. As Hume remarked, "We never remark any passion or principle in others, of which, in some degree or other, we may not find a resemblance in ourselves."13 In short, in order to understand why surprise always follows Du Boisian sympathy, we will need to revise a few basics of Humean sympathy.

Hume says that we form an idea of the passion signaled. But surely sometimes the idea we form of the signaled passion is not an idea of the passion that was signaled, if only because convention and social learning play influential roles in determining the meaning of emotional gestures. A smile may thus be misconstrued as a threat because we know that people have learned how to smile at people that they hate. Or a kiss blown to signal contempt may be misconstrued as expressing love because the conventions we assumed to be necessary for a blown kiss to

<sup>12</sup> See Adam Smith, *The Essential Adam Smith*, ed. Robert L. Heilbroner (New York: Norton, 1986), 23.

<sup>13</sup> Hume, *Treatise*, 207.

express contempt were not followed. Alternatively, even if conventions for contemptible kiss-blowing were followed, we might still form an idea of love because we *wanted* to think that the blown kiss expressed love. Our own psychological set, especially our desires, thus also greatly affects the ideas that emotional signals convey to us.

Adam Smith pressed yet a further challenge. Smith allowed that what Hume described and called "sympathy" was possible, for example, that "grief and joy strongly expressed" might "at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion," but cautioned that the spectator's version of the other's emotion would be "extremely imperfect" until she knew its cause, meaning by "cause" the object of the emotion, that is, what it was directed at.14 If we take "imperfect" in an ordinary sense, it follows, if Smith is right, that the idea Hume says is formed when a passion is signaled is almost always not an idea of the passion that was signaled. An example may help clarify Smith's meaning. We see someone frowning and immediately form an idea of anger. But that idea is a very imperfect idea of the person's anger because we do not know what she is angry at. Consequently we make it less imperfect when we get to know the object of her anger. The implication is that the idea of anger formed in the process of Humean sympathy is anger without its object and is an extremely imperfect idea of anger with its object. Anger with its object, anger at something, is the passion that the person who signals her passion is feeling. If we form only an idea of anger without any object, we are forming an imperfect idea of her passion. If our idea is enlivened so that we come to experience the emotion it corresponds to, we are experiencing a passion that is an imperfect version of the passion that was signaled. For brevity let us call the emotion without its object the emotion simpliciter.

Hume's description of sympathy as proceeding very quickly suggests that the signs of emotion used to signal emotions typically do

<sup>14</sup> Adam Smith, *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, ed. D. D. Raphael and A. L. Mackie (Indianapolis: Liberty Press, 1976), 11.

not indicate the objects of the passions they signal, so that the ideas we typically form of those passions will be ideas of passions simpliciter, not ideas of passions with their objects, which are the passions that the signaler of the passions experienced. If so, as our ideas are enlivened into passions, we come to experience only imperfect versions of the passions that the signaler experienced. When the sympathies of the middle-class white people in Du Bois's example were widened, they formed ideas of the fears, angers, and sorrows, all simpliciter, of the clodhoppers, and therefore came to experience these passions, only simpliciter. Since they were thoroughly familiar with such passions simpliciter, they experienced no surprise, and their widened sympathy was not Du Boisian sympathy.

What does the object of anger add to anger simpliciter? The cognitive theory of emotion suggests that emotions are constituted at least in part by sets of judgments, including evaluative judgments (other constituents may include desire, physical feelings, etc.). The theory further claims that particular emotions require particular kinds of judgments. For example, the judgment that harm is probable, even if not certain, is necessary to generate fear simpliciter. However, and crucially, fear of a definite object will also contain a large number of further judgments about the object of the fear, and these judgments will often differ radically from each other. In short, instances of the same general emotion may differ radically in virtue of differences in the number and complexity of the judgments that help to constitute them.

The upshot is that Humean sympathy can't transfer the robust, nonsimpliciter passions. Not readily anyway. Possibly if there were a specific sign for every particular instance of every emotion, Humean sympathy could proceed as quickly as Hume suggested, and the ideas formed of signaled emotions would be ideas of the emotions as the signalers experienced them—that is, in their robust forms, as opposed to merely ideas of the emotions simpliciter. But that possibility could never be realized. Our capacity to keep generating judgments of increasing complexity about the objects of our passions as our circumstances and beliefs expand or change, guarantees that different instances of the same emotion will differ drastically, even in the same person.

Hume's suggestion that we are more or less familiar with all human emotions is therefore right in one sense and wrong in another. We are more or less familiar with the emotions Humean sympathy transmits; but these are only passions simpliciter. We are not familiar with all emotions with their objects and consequently with all the judgments that help constitute them. The distinction enables us to account for the surprise that accompanies Du Boisian sympathy. Humean sympathy may not surprise us because it transmits passions simpliciter, and we are familiar with all or most such passions. But Du Boisian sympathy will surprise us because it transmits passions with all their objects and judgments and we cannot be familiar with all these objects or with the judgments that help constitute the passions. For example, the ordinary middle-class white people in Du Bois's example may have been surprised when they encountered the sophisticated and complex judgments that they found in the sorrows of clodhoppers because they had assumed that clodhoppers were too stupid to make such judgments. As Rousseau put it, "The rich are consoled about the ill they do to the poor, because they assume the latter to be stupid enough to feel nothing of it."15 If Humean sympathy did not have to be deliberately enhanced into Du Boisian sympathy, the rich could never maintain such assumptions. Thomas Jefferson could maintain his belief that the love of his black slaves for one another was "more an ardent desire" than "a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation,"16 because Humean sympathy transmitted to him only the love simpliciter of his slaves.

How do we make a widened Humean sympathy transmitting passions simpliciter into a Du Boisian sympathy transmitting passions with their objects? The answer may seem easy: identify the objects of the passions simpliciter that Humean sympathy transmitted into us. According to Smith we do so by spontaneously putting ourselves in the place of the person who expressed or signaled the emotion, and as a result we come to form some idea of the *object* of her emotion and therefore come to imagine feeling an emotion that is a more perfect version of her emotion than the passion simpliciter that we first felt. Alas, this process will often not get us Du Boisian sympathy. Consider Smith's example: "We blush for the impudence of another, though he himself appears to have no sense of the impropriety of his own behavior; because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we ourselves should be covered, had we behaved in so absurd a manner."17 In other words when someone behaves impudently and we spontaneously put ourselves in his place, instead of getting a fuller view or experience of *his* passion, we get instead a view of how *we* would feel if we had behaved as he did. This is not Du Boisian sympathy. Du Boisian sympathy wants to get deeper into the *agent's* passion by giving us a fuller account of the judgments that help to constitute it; Smith's proposal does not do that. Instead it gets us deeper into a different passion—the *spectator's*. She identifies the object of the agent's passion and makes judgments about it, using her own reason and background beliefs, and since these judgments will be different from the agent's, and help to constitute her passion, her passion will be different from the agent's. Smith also writes as if he believes that spectator will correctly identify the object of the agent's passion by putting herself in his place; in his example the agent is proud of his behavior, and the spectator is shamed by that same behavior. But since the spectator relies on her own experience, it may happen that what she thinks is the object of the agent's passion is not the object of his passion at all. He may fear a rabid dog,

<sup>17</sup> Smith, *Theory of Moral Sentiments*, 12.

but she may suppose that he fears a puppy. Although Smith was not trying to explain the genesis of moral approval and disapproval, his account of how we react to the imperfections of Humean sympathy emphasizes the difficulty of achieving a Du Boisian sympathy, and even intimates that nature works against our achieving it.

Du Bois's declaration, "All art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda, for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda," suggests that he thought that art could make Du Boisian sympathy possible.18 Perhaps he was inspired by Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, popularly credited with helping to doom slavery. The novel is indeed a plausible means to Du Boisian sympathy. It gives the novelist the space she needs not only to describe her characters' passions simpliciter but to describe them together with their objects; if she describes her characters to resemble her readers, the vivacity of their conceptions of themselves could change their ideas of her characters' emotions into those very emotions, and they would have a Du Boisian sympathy for her characters.

But blacks especially objected that Stowe missed crucial details in her accounts of the slaves' sorrow. Martin Delany, for example, complained that although she portrayed "some of the suffering" of the slaves she really had no "sympathy" for them, and that her "sneers" at "independent" Haiti and esteem for the "dependent" colony in Liberia betrayed her failure to perceive that the slaves sorrowed most deeply for the loss of their independence and freedom.19

Stowe's failure may represent a general tendency. Frederick Douglass relates that the melancholy of the slaves singing matched that of

<sup>18</sup> Du Bois, "Criteria of Negro Art," in *W. E. B. DuBois: A Reader*, ed. David Levering Lewis (New York: Henry Holt, 1995), 511, 513, 514.

<sup>19</sup> Martin Delany, letter to Frederick Douglass in *Martin Delany: A Documentary Reader*, ed. Robert S. Levine (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 232.

the wailing of the starving Irish in the famine of 1845–1846.20 But although the melancholy of the dirge singers regularly reduced people to tears—they were hired to sing at wakes—those tears were not for the sorrow of either black slaves or the victims of famine. Similarly, according to Rousseau, Alexander of Pherae "dared not attend the performance of a single tragedy for fear that he might be seen to moan with Andromache and Priam," but "listened without emotion to the cries of so many citizens daily being murdered on his orders."21

Considerations like these might have suggested to Du Bois that he could make Humean sympathy into Du Boisian sympathy, and art into propaganda, if he accurately described the sorrows of real people, and used *beauty* in the expression of emotion to enliven his readers' ideas of these sorrows into real sorrows. In fact Du Bois claimed that he had always sought "to set the world right" with "beauty";22 and suggested that the beauty of the sorrow songs, as rendered by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, had facilitated the transmission of the slaves' "message" to the world.23 Alas, beauty in the expression of an emotion may attract attention to itself and away from the emotion and thus impede rather than facilitate the emotion's transmission. Perhaps the Fisk Singers earned money for Fisk because people paid to enjoy the beauty of their singing while ignoring the sentiments that their songs expressed.

## *Douglass on Du Boisian Sympathy*

Douglass agreed with Du Bois that the sorrow songs could be powerful means of reform. The "mere hearing of these songs," he claimed, "would do more to impress truly spiritual minded men and women of the soul-crushing and death-dealing characters of slavery, than

the reading of whole volumes of its mere physical cruelties."24 But he pointedly refrained from claiming any beauty for the sorrow songs, describing them instead as "rude," "wild," and "apparently incoherent."25 To be clear, Douglass was not referring to the same thing as Du Bois. Du Bois was referring to the sorrow songs as they were sung by trained singers mainly for white audiences—and sung to be beautiful to attract such audiences. Douglass was referring to the sorrow songs as they were sung by slaves. Still his discussion suggests how and why expressions of sentiments do not have to be beautiful to be reformative.

Douglass's comments suggest three points. First, like Delany, Douglass clearly agreed that white observers who write their "volumes" on slavery's "mere physical cruelties" miss the more elusive though ultimately more important misery that slavery causes by the theft of slaves' liberty. Second, his comments suggest that the slaves expressed and revealed that misery in their singing. And third, he proposes that only the "spiritual minded" would understand that misery. However, Douglass added a crucial fourth point. He claimed that such a "spiritual minded" person must "place himself in the deep, pine woods."26 In other words, slaves must not know that anyone is listening to their singing with an eye to understanding—through that singing—how or what they (the slaves) are thinking and feeling.

In his novelette *The Heroic Slave* Douglass repeated these points and added a fifth. In the story, a gentleman (significantly named Listwell), who "had long desired to sound the mysterious depths of the thoughts and feelings of a slave," becomes an abolitionist after overhearing a slave, Madison Washington, earnestly debating aloud with himself about what he ought to do given his circumstances.27 Crucially,

<sup>24</sup> Douglass, *My Bondage and My Freedom*, 65.

<sup>25</sup> Douglass, *My Bondage and My Freedom*, 65–66.

<sup>26</sup> Douglass, *My Bondage and My Freedom*, 66.

<sup>27</sup> Frederick Douglass, *The Oxford Frederick Douglass Reader*, ed. William L. Andrews (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 135. The name Listwell is significant because it emphasizes that a person who achieves Du Boisian sympathy must *listen* well; not hasten to put himself in the other's place.

Washington is completely unaware that anyone is listening. Indeed, he is in the woods when Listwell hears him. The fifth point thus seems to be that listening to slaves singing is, or at least can be like, listening to a person debating aloud with himself about what he ought to do.

How can such singing be anything like Washington's rational discourse? After all, Washington was considering various reasons for and against ends he could pursue, evidently hoping that he would thereby arrive at a decision about what he ought to do. By contrast, as already noted, in the slaves' singing we simply hear "rude," "wild," and "apparently incoherent songs."

The answer, it seems, is that in both cases—Washington talking to himself and the singing slaves—the actors are in a sense "unaware" that they have an audience. They are both in the "deep pine woods." Indeed, as if replying to an objection that the two activities are *not* similar, Douglass seems to argue that the slaves' singing is only not *obviously* a debate. Thus, although he grants that when he himself was a slave and sang those same songs, he did not know what he was really doing (those songs, he says, were at that point "altogether beyond my feeble comprehension"), Douglass goes on to assert that the truly "thoughtful" and "spiritual minded" who wanted to "sound the mysterious depths" of the slaves' thoughts and feelings *could* understand what the slaves were doing in those songs. Moreover, Douglass not only makes clear that he is referring to the slaves singing at a time when the slaves were "comparatively free; and if thoughtful, had time to think"; he explicitly warns that the songs are only *apparently* incoherent. Though the slaves used "improvised" words that were "jargon to others," Douglass argues, these words were nevertheless "full of … meaning" *to* the slaves.

Taken all together, Douglass seems to have been telling his readers that "thoughtful" and "spiritual minded" men and women would

indeed hear in the slaves' singing something like a debate among people bewildered by their extraordinary circumstances, perplexed about what they ought to do, and inventing a vocabulary to express their perplexities to each other, in order to decide how best to deal with their predicament. They chose the medium of song to do this partly because singing was the only manifestly expressive activity they were allowed to engage in, and partly because it contains resources that can compensate for a paucity of vocabulary.

A person debating with herself or others about what she ought to do understands that sometimes what she does is up to her; that though she may in those cases do what she pleases, she ought to do what is best; that what is best is determined by reasons; that such reasons are usually discovered by close examination of her circumstances and her sentiments; and that reasons often have to be weighed against each other. Kantians tend to refer to the capacity to engage in such activities as the ground of an unforfeitable human dignity. Douglass wanted to suggest that it showed a capacity for freedom and that the fact that the slaves preferred to engage in the arduous activity of exercising that capacity in the rare moments that they were spared a short respite from pain and toil, over simply enjoying the respite, would reveal to their thoughtful, spiritual-minded listeners that they sorrowed more for the loss of their freedom than for their physical ills. If so, those listeners would secure an idea of the slaves' sorrow *with its proper object*, and then in accordance with Hume's theory of sympathy, that idea in the listeners would be enlivened into actual sorrow, (both because of their human resemblance to the slaves and because they too would be inclined to sorrow more for the loss of freedom than for physical ills).

According to Douglass, then, "spiritual minded" men and women could achieve a Du Boisian sympathy with the slaves, not by putting themselves in the slaves' place, but by "thoughtfully" analyzing the sounds that passed through the chambers their souls. This suggests that he believed that emotions expressed in soliloquy can carry

far more information about the details of the emotion than Smith and probably Hume seemed to allow. In particular, Smith's view that observers tend almost automatically to put themselves in the place of the agent, in order to fill out details for the emotion they observe, implies that expressions of emotion normally carry minimal information that would explain the emotion in question. Douglass warns, however, that yielding to the tendency to put oneself into the place of those whom we are observing probably *prevents* understanding the slaves' expressions of emotion. In the case at hand the observers who imagined themselves in the slaves' place, but using their own ideologically shaped reason and judgment, would believe that the slaves sang sorrowfully because of the physical cruelties of slavery. If Delany was right, for example, Stowe got caught in Smith's trap when she misunderstood the slaves' sorrow and pitied them for the physical cruelties they suffered rather than for the loss of their liberty. By contrast, Douglass put his thoughtful and spiritual-minded listener in the "deep pine woods" because people are normally tempted to do more, or other, than express their feelings when they know they have an attentive audience, even if they believe that the audience is on their side. For example, the slaves might try to impress their listener by decorating their singing with beauty, which might draw her attention away from the feelings that they were expressing. The Fisk Jubilee Singers did this and as a result may have foiled the Du Boisian sympathy for the slaves that their singing might have otherwise encouraged.

## *Du Bois's Two Projects*

Douglass's views suggest that Du Bois failed in his primary goal of creating a Du Boisian sympathy for Crummell in his white readers, at least if we assume that they were not among the thoughtful and spiritual-minded persons Douglass spoke of. Du Bois wrote at greatest length on three of Crummell's emotions, his hate even as a child, his despair, and his doubt as a young man. His choice of emotions to emphasize was reasonable given that hate, despair, and doubt are associated in various ways with sorrow and the loss of dignity. But again, if Douglass is right, then sympathy would not suffice to infuse these emotions into readers. Indeed, Du Bois's comment that his white readers would find hate a "strange temptation for a child"28 already concedes this about Crummell's hate. And Du Bois's description of Crummell's despair must have fared even worse. Du Bois relates that Crummell despaired when the Episcopal Seminary rejected his application to study for the priesthood because he was a Negro, thus suggesting that he despaired because the seminary's decision reduced his chances of becoming a priest. But Du Bois's white readers would think that if they were in his place, a black man living in nineteenth-century America, they would know before they applied for admission to the seminary that it would very likely reject his application. Consequently, they would not see its rejection as drastically reducing his chances to complete his plans. So it is hard to see how they would sympathize with his falling into despair as a result. Finally, Du Bois's story, that Crummell doubted his people's moral capacities when his first attempt to educate them failed, misrepresents Crummell's doubt, making it impossible for sympathy to transfuse that doubt into his white readers. Putting themselves in his place, white readers would think, "No sensible person doubts that a cherished goal is achievable just because his *first* attempt to achieve it fails."

And yet, it would be wrong to conclude from the foregoing that Du Bois did better at his second project simply because his black readers were more "spiritual minded" than his white readers. Du Bois succeeded in this second project because his black readers were liable to

read the essay with passions that resembled Crummell's. This follows from Hume's comment that "we never remark any passion in others, of which in some degree or other, we may not find a parallel in ourselves," and that "resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others." Presumably, this is partly because such "parallel passions" between observer and agent help supply detail to the idea that the observer forms of the agent's passion. At a minimum, the resemblance between parallel passions must enable the observer to make educated guesses about the causes of the agent's passion even if the agent's expressions are concealed or muted or simply not accompanied by much explicit explanation. Du Bois's comment that "a thousand thousand black children brood" in hate in circumstances similar to Crummell's suggests that he was relying on parallel passions in his black readers and in Crummell to enable those readers to get accurate ideas of Crummell's passions. For similar reasons, Du Bois's black readers would not think that Crummell despaired because the seminary's rejection of his application lowered his chances of becoming a priest. Relying on their own parallel despairs, they would see that he despaired because the rejection brought vividly to his mind the sheer improbability of his ever reaching his goal.

## *Dignity*

As we have seen, Du Bois's tale showed Crummell fighting losing battles against the enemies of his visions of life; tempted sorely by hate, despair, and doubt; driven into wandering the world in search of knowledge of himself; and finally after twenty years returning home from Africa, "out of the temptation of Hate," "burned by the fire of Despair," and "triumphant over doubt." Du Bois's exultant tone suggests that Crummell had not only fought his menacing vices to a draw, but routed them and returned home invulnerable to them. If so, he returned home with faith, hope, and love, the virtues tradition and logic suggest are incompatible with hate, despair, and doubt. Given that he also returned home with dignity—and Du Bois told his tale of Crummell's struggles with the vices to suggest how they too could return home with dignity—we may reasonably conclude that faith, hope, and love are among the parts of dignity. But they cannot wholly constitute it. Du Bois presented Crummell with faith, hope, and love only *after* he had triumphed over hate, despair, and doubt. Therefore something other than those virtues must have accounted for his triumph, and consequently may also be a part of dignity.

Presumably Du Bois took care to display it conspicuously given the nature of his second project, and supposing that the first sentence of his tale is conspicuous enough and announces that that even as a boy Crummell "struggled with life that he might know the world and know himself."29 I will assume that this struggle accounted for his triumph over hate, despair, and doubt, and was therefore a part of his dignity. Let us therefore get clearer on that struggle.

Presumably it was motivated by a perplexity about who, or what, he was. According to Du Bois such a perplexity was common among thoughtful black people. Every such person, he observed, has asked himself the question "What after all am I?" Since asking the question cannot lead to dignity, given that most do not get there, we must suppose that it led Crummell to dignity because of the consequences of his persistence in trying to answer it. In that case Du Bois suggests that if Crummell reasoned soundly, he would encounter three further questions that Du Bois implied would lead him to the correct answer to the first fundamental question, "What after all am I?" These three questions were "Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my duty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible, and be an American?"30

<sup>29</sup> Du Bois, "Of Alexander Crummell," *Souls of Black Folk*, 134.

<sup>30</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 180.

The first of these three questions may suggest that in trying to know what he was, Crummell would try to know who his biological ancestors were. But the third indicates that if Crummell was reasoning soundly, efforts to know what he was would never lead him to seek to know who his biological ancestors were; no one can have a duty to choose her ancestors because no one can choose her ancestors. The third question about a duty to cease or not to cease being a Negro therefore implies that Du Bois was not thinking of race as a biological category but as a category you could choose to join or leave, although one could be born into it too; and something that one could have a duty to join or to leave, and as we shall see presently something that entails having certain duties. In short Du Bois's third question implied that being a Negro was somewhat like being an American. And if that third question was an elucidation of the first, then Du Bois implied that Crummell's search for self-knowledge—if he reasoned correctly—would eventually turn out to be basically a search for certain of his duties: did he have a duty to be a Negro or an American? And did he have duties as a Negro or as American?

Du Bois implied that if Crummell answered these questions correctly he would conclude that he had duties to be *both* American and Negro, and consequently duties as a Negro and as an American. He could consistently have those two sets of duties. His duties as a Negro were to pursue the distinctive cultural and moral ideals of his race. His duties as an American had their source in a liberalism that guaranteed him a right to pursue a variety of cultural and moral ideals. Therefore he could consistently pursue his duties as a Negro and as an American. Du Bois's comment that there was no reason why "men of different races might not strive together for their race ideals as well, perhaps even better, than in isolation" makes the point.31

<sup>31</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 181.

Crummell did not agree with Du Bois. Perhaps his return home suggests that he agreed that he had a duty to be an American and duties as an American. And perhaps his devoting his life there to the education of his people suggests that he agreed that he had duties as a Negro. But he did not agree that he had a duty *to be* a Negro because he believed that Negroes were a biological category and that he therefore had no choice and so no duty to be a Negro. And he did not agree with Du Bois about what his duties as a Negro were. He could not because Du Bois believed that those duties were to pursue and perfect the distinctive cultural and moral ideals of the race, and he believed that slavery had so thoroughly corrupted the Negro race that it had no cultural and moral ideals worth preserving. In his view his duty as a Negro was to educate Negroes, morally inculcating in them the ideals that slavery had torn from them. And when his early attempts at such education failed, he began to suspect that the Negro's corruption was not after all caused by slavery, but went deeper, and had its source in Africa. A letter written after his residence there suggests that he eventually moderated that suspicion. It reads: "Our ancestors were unfortunate, miserable, and benighted, but nothing more. Their history was a history, not of ignominy and disgrace, but of heathenism and benightedness. And even in that state they exhibited a nobleness of native character, they cherished such virtues, and manifested … manliness and bravery."32 But it does not follow that he had also moderated his view that slavery had thoroughly corrupted Africans in America. Indeed he insisted after its abolition that blacks should avoid even recalling it, since it was a "degrading thing," and recalling it led "by the law of association" to degradation.33

Du Bois's love of the sorrow songs indicates that he scouted this view. He agreed that slavery was a degrading thing, but insisted that

the sorrow songs, the most beautiful music composed in America, conceived and realized by Negroes in slavery, proved that if slavery had corrupted them, it had not corrupted them completely, leaving them still capable of great moral and aesthetic creativity. Moreover, in his view the sorrow songs were not a fluke, but a consequence of human beings in great adversity and more generally an aspect of the processes that create races. Races are created when groups of individuals struggle together for generations to survive in distinctive circumstances that often involve great adversity. These individuals may be, but are not necessarily, biologically related. Rather they are related and bound together by the fact that later members of the group learn from and improve on the findings of earlier members about how to deal with adversity and to survive in the circumstances they find and make for themselves. Supposing that values are discovered or invented through such processes, and differ if the findings of the different races differ, every race will eventually discover or invent some distinctive values, or as Du Bois often put it, distinctive "ideals of life."

Even if he was right it does not follow that the members of a race have duties to pursue the distinctive ideals of their race. The liberalism that Du Bois appealed to earlier to show the compatibility of American and Negro duties insists that the members of a race in a liberal state are free to pursue a variety of ideals, as long as they fulfill their duties to the state. To answer that challenge Du Bois moved the issue to a larger stage. The members of a race have duties to pursue the distinctive ideals of their race because they have duties to help perfect humanity. Like Kant, whose concern for the prospects of humanity led him to claim that individuals have duties to seek peace so that humanity can perfect its talents, Du Bois claimed that individuals have duties to perfect their racial ideals in order to help guide humanity "nearer and nearer that perfection of life for which we all long," that "one far off Divine Event."34

<sup>34</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 176.

The idea that such ideals could help guide humanity in this way is not implausible. Ideals useful to humanity are not exclusively the handiwork of seers, but also that of people conducting "experiments in living" in order to find good ways to live. Since the races are precisely such people organized into groups, then given generally egalitarian assumptions, the ideals that races glean from their "experiments" may very well help humanity to better itself. Liberals might still object that individuals do not have duties to perfect humanity, and therefore cannot have duties to perfect their racial ideals. But Du Bois was not that kind of liberal. On the contrary, Du Bois's definition of race as a group of people "always of common … impulses" and "both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together for the accomplishment" of their "more or less vividly conceived," implies that individuals do have imperfect duties to not merely perfect humanity, but specifically to perfect their racial ideals.35

Of course, it might be objected that if the members of a race have such powerful impulses to strive to perfect their racial ideals voluntarily or involuntarily, they will inevitably strive to perfect their racial ideals and consequently cannot have duties to do so. But the fact that people have strong impulses to act in one way does not mean that they cannot also have strong impulses to act in opposite ways. Nor does it mean that they cannot for some reason resist their own impulses. Moreover, people may strive for their racial ideals not intending to do so, because they do not know that the ideals they strive for are their racial ideals; and in that case, since they only strive for their racial ideals involuntarily, they cannot strive for them as duties they have as members of the race. In other words, Du Bois was not saying that Crummell and black people generally would or should strive for their racial ideals for any old reason. He meant

<sup>35</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 176.

that they had duties to perfect their racial ideals, and they have they duties because they are black people. Crummell's story illustrates the point. As a youth stirred by sympathy with his schoolmates and the distant slaves, he had a "vision" in which he was called to lead the slaves "out of the house of bondage." In his striving to do so he was striving to realize the ideals of his race, since freedom was in fact among its ideals, but he did not understand what he was doing since, as we have seen, he believed that slavery had so corrupted his race that it had no ideals worth striving for. Consequently his striving for his ideals was "involuntary" and not undertaken as a duty. Further, he did not see his striving for the freedom of his race as a duty that he had as a Negro. Since he believed that Negroes were simply people of common blood, when he thought that he had a duty to lead them to freedom, he was supposing—mistakenly—that he had such duties simply because he shared ancestors with them. He did not see that he had such duties because of a further greater duty to help guide humanity to its perfection, and that in fulfilling these duties he was being true to his—and his people's—own deepest and most valuable impulses and ideals.

Though Crummell never understood or truly acknowledged his racial impulses and ideals, they helped save him from the vices of hate, despair, and doubt, and eventually led him to dignity. The conflicts of those impulses with the deep and opposing impulses and ideals that he inevitably acquired as a Negro living in America made him feel that he was divided into two different warring individuals, provoked him to ask vainly which of these individuals he really was, and left him with a double consciousness, wandering the world, a "soul in search of itself." He got nowhere near finding himself until he understood that, to do so, he first had to answer another question that had ever "gnawed" as him: "What, in God's name, am I on earth for?"36

<sup>36</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 141.

In other words he eventually came to understand that the question "What am I really?" was a moral question, requiring that he stand back from, and reflect on, his two warring selves and ask himself the question "Which of the two warring individuals within myself do I have a *duty* to be?"

He never arrived at the correct answer to it, according to Du Bois, namely that he had a duty to be both. He might have come to see that he was an American with the duties of an American, and that he had duties as a Negro. But he never understood what it meant to be a Negro, or therefore why he had duties as a Negro. But he got closer to the right answer than it might at first appear. When he failed abjectly at his first attempt at moral education and mourned in despair and doubt that his people were "dumb driven cattle," corrupted even before the disaster of slavery, he was on the verge of acknowledging that he could choose whether to distance himself from them morally, whether to contemn them, whether to be one of them. And he remained on that verge until he lived in Africa and concluded that his ancestors "exhibited a nobleness of native character, … cherished such virtues, and manifested … manliness and bravery." At that point he was in fact finally choosing irrevocably to be a Negro, not because he shared their "blood," for this he had always known, but because he shared their ideals through sharing a considerable part of their history. Consequently, when he returned home and devoted himself to the education of his people, it was not as if he was inculcating in them ideals that were altogether foreign to them. It was as if he was arousing awareness of ideals that they might have learned from their ancestors that slavery had driven underground, but that could with proper education be brought to full consciousness. This position was not identical to Du Bois's, for it did not admit that Negroes had continued the process of building ideals even in slavery, but it was close enough to lead to his triumph over hate, despair, and doubt and ultimately to

achieve dignity. For it meant that he had found his place in the world and answered the question why he was on earth. He was on earth to educate his people back into virtue. And he was assured of eventual victory, for he was educating a people who though outwardly corrupted still heard echoes of the learned virtues of their ancestors and could be made virtuous again.
