# Series Foreword

Oxford Philosophical Concepts (OPC) offers an innovative approach to philosophy's past and its relation to other disciplines. As a series, it is unique in exploring the transformations of central philosophical concepts from their ancient sources to their modern use.

OPC has several goals: to make it easier for historians to contextualize key concepts in the history of philosophy, to render that history accessible to a wide audience, and to enliven contemporary discussions by displaying the rich and varied sources of philosophical concepts still in use today. The means to these goals are simple enough: eminent scholars come together to rethink a central concept in philosophy's past. The point of this rethinking is not to offer a broad overview, but to identify problems the concept was originally supposed to solve and investigate how approaches to them shifted over time, sometimes radically. Recent scholarship has made evident the benefits of re-examining the standard narratives about western philosophy. OPC's editors look beyond the canon and explore their concepts over a wide philosophical landscape. Each volume traces a notion from its inception as a solution to specific problems through its historical transformations to its modern use, all the while acknowledging its historical context. Each OPC volume is a history of its concept in that it tells a story about changing solutions to its well-defined problem. Many editors have found it appropriate to include long-ignored writings drawn from the Islamic and Jewish traditions and the philosophical contributions of women. Volumes also explore ideas drawn from Buddhist, Chinese, Indian, and other philosophical cultures when doing so adds an especially helpful new perspective. By combining scholarly innovation with focused and astute analysis, OPC encourages a deeper understanding of our philosophical past and present.

One of the most innovative features of OPC is its recognition that philosophy bears a rich relation to art, music, literature, religion, science, and other cultural practices. The series speaks to the need for informed interdisciplinary exchanges. Its editors assume that the most difficult and profound philosophical ideas can be made comprehensible to a large audience and that materials not strictly philosophical often bear a significant relevance to philosophy. To this end, each OPC volume includes "reflections." These are short, stand-alone essays written by specialists in art, music, literature, theology, science, or cultural studies that reflect on the concept from their own disciplinary perspectives. The goal of these essays is to enliven, enrich, and exemplify the volume's concept and reconsider the boundary between philosophical and extraphilosophical materials. OPC's reflections display the benefits of using philosophical concepts and distinctions in areas that are not strictly philosophical, and encourage philosophers to move beyond the borders of their discipline as presently conceived.

The volumes of OPC arrive at an auspicious moment. Many philosophers are keen to invigorate the discipline. OPC aims to provoke philosophical imaginations by uncovering the brilliant twists and unforeseen turns of philosophy's past.

# Acknowledgments

Five years ago, Christia Mercer casually asked me over dinner what I'd choose to investigate, were I were to contribute to her (then) new series of books, Oxford Philosophical Concepts. I hadn't anticipated the question, and yet my reply was immediate. "Dignity."

The truth is, I had already been mulling over the idea of writing a history of human dignity. I had been working on the subject since 2006, but with a growing dissatisfaction over the lack of any concerted historical treatment of the concept. However, I had also concluded that it was foolish to think I could write dignity's history by myself. I had wanted to write the history of dignity from its origins: From ancient honor cultures and Greco-Roman philosophical ethics, through early Christian, Islamic, and medieval theology, across the revolutionary eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, right up to the doorstep of our contemporary worldview. But to do that myself, and to do it well, ended up seeming like hubris to me. The history of dignity needed a collection of scholars with an array of languages and specializations. And thus it was a stroke of high fortune to have met Christia Mercer when I did. She gave me the opportunity to produce what I alone could not make possible. I owe her a debt I cannot repay, though I hope the book before you proves some reward for her faith in my vision, her wise guidance, and her unfailing encouragement over the intervening years.

For similar reasons I am indebted to the authors of this volume. It is their expertise and creative talents, as well as their admirable patience, that made this book possible. Moreover, many of the authors willingly traveled to the University of Memphis for a workshop during the drafting stage. I am grateful for this extra effort, which led to many invaluable improvements in all our work. I am likewise grateful to the Department of Philosophy at the University of Memphis for its generous support of this workshop and to the various students and faculty from Memphis who participated in it.

I owe a special debt to Peter Ohlin at Oxford University Press for adding his enthusiasm for this project to mine, and to his entire team for their support and practical advice during the publishing process. I'm grateful to Andy Britton for assistance with the index, and to my colleagues at the University of Memphis for their steady encouragement of my work on human dignity over the years, especially Stephan Blatti, Bill Lawson, John Tienson, and Deb Tollefsen. I also wish to give special thanks to Simone Zurbuchen, Christian Maurer, and the Université de Lausanne for organizing the 2014 conference, "Dignity, Respect, and Esteem in Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Moral Philosophy before Kant," which afforded me the opportunity to present a full draft of my own chapter. I received excellent feedback, especially from my fellow presenters Lisa Broussois, Knud Haakonssen, James A. Harris, Christian Maurer, James Moore, Michael Seidler, Jacqueline Taylor, and Simone Zurbuchen. An unplanned post dinner discussion with Knud Haakonssen over generously sized beers was especially valuable. My chapter also benefited during its final stages from written feedback from Charles Griswold, Ryan Hanley, and Christia Mercer. And, of course, I am grateful to my wife and daughters for their encouragement of all my work, but also their priceless ability to whisk me away from the realities of this work, and give my mind a chance to rest.

Finally, I am grateful to the real historical champions of human dignity—to the men and women who, often at great, even ultimate risk, pressed into the world's conscience an ever greater appreciation of equal human worth. My greatest hope is that this book will somehow aid in this cause. However, I confess a new anxiety over the prospects of these lofty ambitions. Writing these acknowledgments, at the close of 2016, and looking into a suddenly uncertain future, I worry we shall witness an erosion of social justice in precisely those areas where human dignity is most salient. I thus close with a kind of promissory acknowledgment: for all those who, in the years to come, will ensure that the cry of human dignity is never silenced, I am humbly, and deeply, grateful.

# Introduction

The meaning of "dignity" today would surprise our modern ancestors. For us, dignity—that is, human dignity—refers to the fundamental moral worth or status supposedly belonging to all persons equally. It is correspondingly a precious concept, especially in western society. It marks a line in the moral sand that most of us think should never be crossed. Oppressed and marginalized people cry out on behalf of dignity. Humanitarian organizations lobby in its name. And state constitutions around the word claim dignity as the explicit grounds of their most fundamental entitlements and protections.

But all this is relatively new. Until about 1830–1850, neither the English term "dignity," nor its Latin root *dignitas*, nor the French counterpart *dignité*, had any currency as meaning the "inherent or unearned worth of all persons." Instead, in everything from Hobbes's *Leviathan* (1651) to Samuel Johnson's *Dictionary* (1755) to Webster's *Compendious Dictionary* (1806), "dignity" had a conventional merit connotation, something like the "rank of elevation" that Johnson officially gave it.1 In other words, until a little over a century ago, dignity connoted *social* status of the kind associated with nobility, power, gentlemanly comportment, or preferment within the church—not some fundamental, unearned, equally shared *moral* status among humans.

The poignancy of this change is reflected in the progress of human rights during the same time period. Consider: In the modern world, circa 1750 to the present, few if any moral or political claims have garnered more agreement than the claim that humans enjoy certain "unalienable" rights, as the US Declaration of Independence famously described them in 1776. And if we pause to ask, "In virtue of what do we have such rights?"—the answer most of us reach is that these rights derive from the fundamental moral worth of humans, which, moreover, is an answer that *today* we all recognize as synonymous with a claim about human dignity. And yet the US Declaration nowhere explicitly uses the term "dignity" to support its famed rights claim.2 Nor does the US Constitution. In fact, unlike rights terminology, which became common in constitutional contexts during the 1700s, and in western use stretches at least as far back as England's Magna Carta in 1215, dignity terminology does not appear in such a context until the Mexican constitution of 1917, and shortly thereafter the 1919 Weimer constitution. And even then, it isn't clear that these documents understand dignity in the moralized sense, or use it to ground rights.3 "Dignity" *might* have this moralized connotation in the preamble to the Constitution of Ireland of 1937, which declares, among many reasons for adopting it, "so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured."4 But ultimately it wasn't until the 1948

Lebech, *On the Problem of Human Dignity: A Hermeneutical and Phenomenological Investigation* (Würzburg: Königshausen and Neumann, 2008).

Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which uses the term twice in the preamble to justify itself, that "dignity" began to feature clearly and commonly in official political declarations with the kind of moralized meaning we ascribe to it today (after which point the use of "dignity" in such contexts expanded dramatically).5

So how did this sea change between the merit and moral meanings of "dignity" come about? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a clear reflection of the fact that dignity's moralized meaning had become normalized by 1948. But what happened before 1948 that explains this? And even if we can answer this question, and thereby clarify dignity's nineteenth- and early twentieth-century history, we must wonder—is the moralized meaning of dignity, which is so fundamental to our lives today, really only two centuries old? Or might the moralized concept of equal, fundamental human worth be older, albeit existing under different terminology? If so, just how old is the moralized concept of dignity? On the other hand, who were the innovators of the modern conception? Many readers of this volume will immediately think of Immanuel Kant, the German Enlightenment philosopher who, in 1785, famously claimed we have a categorical duty to treat persons only as "ends in themselves" and never as "mere means."6 This is because, Kant argued, humans do not have a "price," only *Würde* often translated as "dignity." But did Kant really construct his argument for dignity out of whole cloth? Or were there even earlier innovators of

But it was not made explicit until a 1966 convention amending that Charter ("United Nations Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights," adopted by GA Res. 2200A [XXI] of December 16, 1966). Ensuing political declarations include the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany (1949), the Final Act of the Helsinki Conference (1975), and the constitutions of India (1949), Portugal (1976), and South Africa (1993), just to name a few.

the modern concept? If so, how did these various early modern ideas about dignity connect up to the moralized notion we use today? And, finally, how do we reconcile the ever-growing ubiquity of dignity talk in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries with its equally manifest violation, as, for example, occurred in America during its slavery years and subsequent Jim Crow era; but also as seems reflected in the ongoing economic disparity between whites and blacks in America today, in America's practice of mass incarceration of black men, in its blind eye for black-on-black gun violence, and, most recently, in the so far judicially vindicated but wildly suspect police killings of black men?7

This volume tries to answer these questions, and thereby to deliver the first dedicated conceptual history of dignity in its moralized sense. I start with a brief overview.

## A Basic Distinction

In order to make sense of the history of dignity, it helps to keep the following distinction in mind. When we speak of dignity, there are two different kinds, or levels, of claims we tend to make. First, we make *substantive* claims about what it takes to have dignity. That is, we hypothesize what it is about being human that makes it true that we have dignity. Perhaps it is our autonomy, or our rationality, or our soul, or our "likeness" to God, or our capacity to form caring relationships, or our bodily form, and so on. Each of these would be a way of answering the question: In virtue of what do humans *have* dignity?

Second, we make *formal* claims about dignity. That is, we identify the general conceptual features or conditions that we think apply to any suitable substantive claim. For example, regardless of what we

<sup>7</sup> In 2015, American police killed unarmed black people at five times the rate of unarmed white men—102 in all. As of the writing of this introduction in July 2016, 136 black people have been killed by American officers already this year. Some of the most controversial cases are Philando Castille and Alton Sterling in 2016, Walter Scott and Freddie Gray in 2015, and Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and Michael Brown (in 2014)—though tragically there are so many, many more names.

think makes it true that we have dignity (such as rationality), we often speak of dignity as something humans don't have to earn. If we accept this, then this feature of being "unearned" would be formal. And it would constrain what we are willing to accept as far as substantive claims go. Thus, one might sensibly say, "I'm not sure what it is about being human that makes it true that we have dignity. Maybe it is our capacity for rationality. Maybe it is something else. But whatever it is, it better be something we don't have to earn. Or I won't call it dignity."

Now, any substantive claim (that is, any answer to the "in virtue of what" question) eventually requires defense; likewise for formal claims. And of course some of these claims will be more contentious than others. Furthermore, some claims will raise new questions. For example, if we claim that humans have dignity in virtue of our capacity to form caring relationships, then we must wonder whether dignity is enjoyed by nonhuman animals, whether primates, pigeons, pandas, or poodles. Finally, note that it is perfectly possible that distinct claims about the nature of dignity, substantive or formal, will be compatible. This is easy to see in the formal case. For example, dignity is often said to be not only an *unearned* value but also a *distinctive* value, in the sense that the worth of a human being is not straightforwardly comparable to other values, whether this other value is the (nonmoral) worth of a good apple or the (moral) worth of a good action. But compatibility is also possible for different answers to the substantive "in virtue of what" question. Thus, there is no pretheoretical reason to deny that we have dignity in virtue of, say, *both* our autonomy *and* our ability to form caring relationships. In other words, the substance of dignity might be plural.

Having said all this, also keep in mind that the chapters in this volume do not primarily aim to defend any given theory of dignity. By and in large, they aim to analyze past theories and their defenses. Correspondingly, most of the questions I just articulated—such as whether a given account of dignity extends to animals—are not much discussed here. Moreover, the reader should note that most of the authors in this volume do not stop to explicitly distinguish substantive claims about dignity from formal ones, as I just did. This substantive-formal distinction is my own ahistorical observation, which I offer as a tool for the reader, to help her digest the various chapters on their own terms, as well as synthesize conclusions about the volume as a whole.

## Dignity Now

In retrospect, there were signs in the eighteenth-century usage that predicted a revision from the merit sense of dignity to the moralized sense. For example, although Samuel Johnson defined *worthy* as "valuable; noble; illustrious; having dignity or excellence," Johnson's definition of the primitive term, *worth*, was dominated by fungible, extrinsic, and economic notions of value. Thus "dignity," as opposed to "worth," must have presented itself to Kant's first translators as an attractive choice for Kant's term *Würde* (at least, in the specific context of *human* worth, which Kant was trying to explain).8 After all, as I noted already, Kant claimed that to have dignity is to be "raised above all price"—so a term essentially connoting interchangeable value, as "worth" did at the time, would have been a poor choice.9

Also interesting are elements internal to Johnson's *Dictionary* that suggest some drift in the concept of dignity, namely, toward a *non*fungible sense of worth. Thus, consider Johnson's first two definitions of *equality*:

- 1. Likeness to any qualities compared
- 2. The same degree of dignity10

<sup>8</sup> The fungibility of value was also true of the German *Werth*, which translators would have been trying to distinguish from *Würde*.

<sup>9</sup> Kant, *Groundwork*, 4:434.

<sup>10</sup> "Page View, Page 714," in Johnson, *Dictionary*.

Given the range of egalitarian agitation across all elements of mideighteenth-century European culture, this is a remarkable definition. To suggest that true equality means *equal* human *dignity* is to challenge the then-dominant use of "dignity" to indicate *un*equal measures of social distinction, such as existed between gentry and commoners. This impression is buttressed by the usage example Johnson selected from Milton for the second definition noted above, of "the same degree of dignity":

> One shall rise, Of proud ambition; who, not content With fair *equality*, fraternal slate, Will arrogate dominion undeserv'd, Over his brethren.11

Or consider another of Johnson's usage examples, this time from Shakespeare, for the first definition of "man" as "human being":

The king is but a *man* as I am.12

In a day where divine right and absolute sovereignty were live ideas, and dictionaries and encyclopedias had become clandestine means for the expression of irreverent ideas, we definitely miss something if we dismiss Johnson's usage choices as politically and philosophically unimportant. Instead, I suggest Johnson's choices mark a deeper story about a general rethinking of human worth during the European Enlightenment—a story that somehow explains, at least partly, how we got to the moralized sense of dignity common today.13

<sup>11</sup> "Page View, Page 714," in Johnson, *Dictionary*.

<sup>12</sup> "Page View, Page 1252," in Johnson, *Dictionary*.

<sup>13</sup> Boswell's famous biography of Johnson led to the impression that Johnson was deeply conservative. This view is no longer uncritically accepted. Indeed, Johnson opposed slavery on moral grounds, and, as Boswell himself related, once proposed a toast to the "next rebellion of the negroes in the West Indies."

None of this is to suggest, however, that we enjoy a unified concept of dignity today, as if there was a clean transition from the older merit connotation of social rank to a contemporary moralized one of unearned, equal worth of persons. Obviously this isn't true. We still speak of the dignity of queens and kings; we speak of dignitaries; and we speak of people acting in dignified ways. All these have social merit connotations. Moreover, there are connotations of "dignity" that don't fit easily with either the merit or the moralized meaning. The term sometimes connotes poise, gravitas, beauty, grace, personality, and integrity. We also talk of one's "sense" of dignity and call people out when we think such a sense lacking, as when we say to someone who lives under the boss's thumb, "Where is your sense of dignity?" In these cases we seem to mean something like (though not exactly like), psychological self-esteem.14

This complexity is a problem for those interested in the moralized concept of dignity for two connected reasons. First, relative to other areas of philosophical inquiry, the study of dignity is very thin. There is, to be sure, a considerable body of literature on Kant's particular view of dignity. And dignity is often marshaled by name to justify various arguments in contemporary moral and political philosophy. But there hasn't been much study of dignity itself. There hasn't been much independent theory about what dignity *is*—let alone a serious, comprehensive history of the concept. Admittedly, this has started to change, and this change is welcome. However, given the weight the concept bears in western value systems today as the implicit or explicit grounds for egalitarianism and theories of human rights, as well as a principle of legal theory, judicial reasoning, and even written law—the paucity of research into dignity is odd.

Second, the conceptual complexity surrounding dignity has sparked disagreement about the utility of the concept just as research into it

<sup>14</sup> Strictly speaking, "dignity" can even denote the apex of planetary astrological influence.

seems ready to blossom. In particular, some have argued that the complexity of "dignity" is either cumbersome messiness or essential ambiguity, either of which constitutes a sufficient reason to jettison the notion from practical discourse. The Yale bioethicist Ruth Macklin made this complaint in a widely read 2002 editorial: "Dignity," Macklin asserted, "is a useless concept. It means no more than respect for persons or their autonomy."15 Initially, Macklin was answered by blunt contradiction. For example, in their 2007 anthology, *Perspectives on Human Dignity* one of the first anthologies devoted to the topic of dignity—Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss spoke *not* of ambiguity, but instead of the conceptual "breadth" of dignity. And they argued this breadth is evidence of the fundamental importance of the concept of dignity to our lives.16 However, in the ensuing years the kind of skepticism Macklin expressed has proven to have staying power. Correspondingly, scholars hoping to vindicate the utility of dignity have increasingly thought it necessary to unravel its knotted ball of meanings, not simply admire them. And yet this interest in unraveling the meanings of dignity has not generally corresponded with serious history of these meanings; hence my motivation for the volume of essays before you.

To be clear, there have been some good starts at history. Some of these have come as part of contemporary projects primarily aimed at delivering new constructive theories of human dignity. For example, feminist theory has occasionally connected up with historical reflection about dignity, especially in the work of Martha Nussbaum. Nussbaum has argued for a "capabilities" conception of human dignity, which she has partly drawn from ancient Stoic cosmopolitism.17 Or there is George

Kateb's *Human Dignity* (2011), which suggests that human dignity is partly constituted by a unique role humans have—or should have—as "stewards" of the earth. Kateb's argument plays off some illuminating historical reflections on classical liberal conceptions of human worth.18 And then there is Jeremy Waldron's short but important 2012 essay, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights.* Waldron's argument necessarily involves some history in as much as he claims that our moralized concept of dignity is really still a merit concept, that is, *apiece with* its early modern meaning.19 The twist, according to Waldron, is that the political, social, and moral revolutions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries led to a uniform "leveling up" of social rank. Today, he claims, we all have the same elevated *social* rank.

More explicit history also exists. One doesn't have to dig hard, for example, to find historical research on dignity in legal and constitutional theory. But then again, the bulk of this research has dealt only with early to middle twentieth-century history.20 By contrast, the volume I am offering you explores much farther back. An important exception, in the legal context, is Christopher McCrudden's "Human Dignity and Judicial Interpretation of Human Rights" (2008), the opening of which offers a wonderfully concise history of the idea of dignity in legal theory reaching back to the ancient world. Still, McCrudden's history is only meant to set up a larger nonhistorical

inquiry. Correspondingly, he covers the entire pre-nineteenth-century legal history of dignity in just a few pages. The volume I am offering does not hurry.21

Michael Rosen's *Dignity: Its History and Meaning* (2012) is another important entry into explicit history. Rosen's book is even predicated on Macklin's skeptical utility challenge to dignity, thus fitting nicely into the dialectic I've been sketching.22 And yet Rosen's book is also intentionally breezy in the sense that it self-consciously doesn't pretend at expertise on every era of history it covers, but rather attempts to offer a bird's-eye view on the concept of dignity in general. By contrast, this volume does aim at expertise in each of the historical periods it examines, and its focus is not dignity in general, but dignity in the moralized sense. Finally, there is the *Cambridge Handbook of Human Dignity* (2014)—a massive book with a sweeping overview of dignity and its historical development. As such, it is an important resource for serious scholars. But it is a very different book from the volume now before you. The volume before you is not a handbook. It does not pretend to be an encyclopedia of dignity's origins, historical meaning, and import. It is not an accounting of "all" that dignity once meant.

<sup>21</sup> McCrudden gave history another shake in his impressive edited volume *Understanding Human Dignity*. But little in the six historical chapters of that volume look backs before the nineteenth century.

<sup>22</sup> Rosen nicely points out, however, that Macklin's criticism isn't novel. Thus, as part of an attack on the Kantian legacy, Rosen notes, the nineteenth-century philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer called human dignity the "shibboleth of all the perplexed and empty headed moralists." See A. Schopenhauer, *On the Basis of Morality*, trans. E. F. J. Payne (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1965), 100, cited in Michael Rosen, *Dignity: Its History and Meaning* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012), 1. Rosen further points out that for Schopenhauer it wasn't simply the ambiguity of the concept that made it useless. Rather, Schopenhauer thought that the moralized notion of an inherent or distinctive *human* worth won and continues to win our credence only because the notion flatters our pride. It is an interestingly hypothesis, though in the context of this volume it is worth noting that the hypothesis is still older than Rosen (or Schopenhauer for that matter) noticed. In his *Fable of the Bees* (1714), Bernard Mandeville essentially made the same argument. Speaking conjecturally about the origins of morality, Mandeville wrote, "Making use of this bewitching Engine [of flattery], they [the Politicians] extoll'd the excellency of our Nature above other Animals…. Which being done, they laid before them how unbecoming it was the Dignity of such sublime Creatures to be solicitous about gratifying those Appetites, which they had in common with Brutes, and at the same time unmindful of those higher Qualities that gave them the preeminence over all visible Beings" (*The Fable of the Bees*, 2 vols. [1714; repr. Indianapolis: Liberty Fund Press, 1988], 43).

On the contrary, as I said before, this volume is constrained to being a history of dignity in its moralized sense. Moreover, what follows in this volume is not a series of descriptions recording dignity's history, as would be typical in a handbook. Instead, what follows is a series of arguments that aims to set that record straight—at least with respect to dignity's moralized sense. In each chapter, historical assumptions are challenged, platitudes overturned, and new historical possibilities staked out.

## Dignity Then?

In what ways does the history of dignity need straightening out? Frankly, in more ways than this volume can address. Indeed, even between the main chapters of this volume the reader will find shorter reflection pieces that extend its critical approach. Thus, David Wong briefly wonders whether dignity really had a place in ancient Chinese traditions, as some have suggested. Edward Town asks how the rise of a moralized dignity ethos in Europe was reflected in the art of its day. Charles Mills challenges us to consider the degree to which the dignity ethos is indexed to a particular historical time and, as a consequence, turns on hidden assumptions about "whiteness." Somogy Varga thinks about dignity and its relation to labor, challenging us to reconsider Marx's worry that the dignity ethos is just way of beguiling us into accepting the drudgery and alienating life of capitalist society. Marcus Duwell discusses dignity in the context of medicine, specifically to warn about overeager applications of dignity in bioethics. And Emma Kaufman confronts us with the stark injustices of the American penal system and its use of the death penalty, ultimately posing this unsettling question about the western sermon of human dignity: Could it be that dignity is a relationship between people and polities, one that disappears when governments incarcerate and kill?

Meanwhile, there are at least four major platitudes about dignity's history, which the main chapters of this volume end up proving false

or at least highly exaggerated. Depending on your background, each of these may ring more or less true—that is, as being a platitude about the history of dignity. But I assure you that each has its quarter in contemporary discussion.

- 1. Platitude: The western creed of human dignity stems from the wisdom of eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century revolutionary thinkers, who at the founding of new liberal states like America, or the reformation of existing ones like France and England, sagely propounded the inviolable value of individual human beings. In fact, as Mika LaVaque-Manty shows, the universalization of a moralized sense of dignity did not turn on a few moments of moral serendipity about the inherent worth of human persons, which was then writ large into formative constitutional documents. Instead, the process by which the moralized sense of dignity was universalized was a complex political process that relied on "making *contingent* and *noninherent* attributes of persons the grounds for why someone should be regarded as having dignity." Relatedly, in her contribution, Christine Henderson argues that this process was intimately connected to the "bourgeoisie" social class that began to emerge in later eighteenth century. As a result of the interplay of changing economic roles and the social virtues that became associated with those roles, Henderson argues, the "workingman" began to rethink himself and his social place in a way consistent with the moralized sense of dignity. Finally, Bernard Boxill reminds us that romantic idealizations of the universalization of human dignity in the modern world are belied by the social paradoxes faced by marginalized peoples during the same period. Boxill takes as his foil W. E. B. Du Bois's efforts to endorse emergent ideas of human equality in the face of the gross inequity facing black people in the western world. Through this foil Boxill further explores the lamentable
burden of other early modern Africana philosophers: to reconcile the bourgeoning ethos of dignity with the lived experience of oppression.

- 2. Platitude: The early modern concept of dignity originates with Immanuel Kant, who argued that all persons have an inherent value, or dignity, stemming from their capacity for rationality, which value commands moral respect from others. In fact, this dogma—perhaps the greatest platitude of the bunch—is seriously suspect. In the first place, Oliver Sensen argues that it is a long-standing interpretive mistake to think Kant grounds the obligation to respect others on a value the *other* possesses, and, moreover, that "dignity" is not the name Kant gives to such a value anyway. Sensen also details Kant's indebtedness to Rousseau for his own thinking about human worth and respect. Stephen Darwall also examines the connection between dignity and respect, but now to show that only certain conceptions of dignity will support the kind of inference about respect that could justify using dignity to ground human rights. Moreover, Darwall argues, even if Kant was on the right track on this score, the ultimate credit goes to the natural law philosopher Samuel Pufendorf, who was writing a century before Kant. Finally, in my own contribution to the volume, I argue that Pufendorf 's lead was followed by another pre-Kantian thinker, the French *luminaire* Denis Diderot. More important, according to Diderot dignity did not consist (substantively) in our *rational* nature, but in our *passionate* nature. This suggests a radical historical alternative to the stale rationalist mantra about dignity in philosophical ethics.
- 3. Platitude: The moralized concept of dignity does not originate with Kant. It was explicitly celebrated as early as the Renaissance, in Giovanni Pico della Mirandola's *Oration on the Dignity of Man* from 1486. Moreover, Pico's oration is drawn from the older, medieval Christian doctrine of *imago*

*Dei*—which tells us that we are made in God's likeness ("in the image of God"), and this likeness grounds our distinctive moral worth or status. In fact, though Christian theologians will be disappointed to hear it, once again these claims are at best misleading and at worst simply false. First, Brian Copenhaver flatly contradicts the claim that Pico was talking about dignity in the moralized sense. Besides reminding us that the title of Pico's speech postdates Pico, Cophenaver points out that the speech uses the Latin *dignitas* only twice, and that "in neither case does *dignitas* belong to humans, except aspirationally, and neither justifies 'dignity' as a translation, with all the Kantian baggage of the modern English word." On the contrary, if there was a Renaissance source for dignity, Copenhaver argues, it comes from Pico's predecessor, Giannozzo Manetti. Adding to this reversal of fortunes, Bonnie Kent marshals extensive evidence against the claim that *imago Dei* was conceived (at least in the tradition of the Latin West) in a way that could be reconciled with today's moralized concept of dignity. She acknowledges that dignity was widely discussed by medieval Christian scholars; likewise for the doctrine of *imago Dei*. However, Kent argues, the stark truth is that these discussions did not intersect in a way that supports an inference to our moralized notion of dignity. In fact, if there was a live medieval religious doctrine of dignity, it seems we would be better served looking to Arabic traditions. Thus, in his contribution, Mustafa Shah argues that a moralized concept of dignity *can* be attributed to Islamic scholarship during the same period—though it must be untangled from merit conceptions that also loomed large. In the Islamic tradition, Shah explains, legislation of law deals with ritual and non-ritual: "A perfect distinction is not drawn between the realm of the spiritual and the realm of the temporal: the field of law, or Sharīʿah, focuses on the systematic regulation of *all* aspects of human conduct and interaction."

Hence, discussions of respect between persons and all that goes with it, from station and rank to integrity and inalienable worth, were *constitutive* topics in the religious scholarship of the day.

- 4. Platitude: "Dignity" derives from the Latin *dignitas*; and *dignitas*, which was a major subject of ancient Roman discussion, is the true origin of our concept of dignity. For, although some Roman thinkers thought of *dignitas* only in its merit sense, others, and most importantly, Cicero, had a proleptic understanding of *dignitas* that anticipated today's moralized sense. In fact, the textual support for this increasingly popular interpretation of Roman thought is very thin, as Miriam Griffin demonstrates in her contribution to this volume. On the one hand, she argues, straightforward lexical analysis offers very little support for connecting *dignitas* to our present-day, moralized sense of dignity. On the other hand, when we branch out to other ancient Roman concepts in an effort to see if dignity might be simply hiding under different terminology, we run into a fundamental challenge. "Stoics and Roman moralists," Griffin explains, "think in terms of *officia*, obligations or duties or functions that our nature, properly understood, imposes on *us*." Correspondingly, "The entitlements and rights of those at the *receiving end* of our actions are far less prominent in their thinking" (emphases added). So, Griffin warns, in looking for a Roman precursor to our modern notion of dignity, "we are swimming against the current." And yet once again there is a constructive irony. For, even if Roman thought was not as forward-thinking as some have claimed, Patrice Rankine suggests that a moralized notion of dignity does have a place in the even older Homeric epics and some of the poetic tradition that followed. To be clear, Rankine does not suggest that Homer and his heirs espoused anything like a *doctrine* of dignity. "Instead," he argues, in the ancient poetic tradition,

"human dignity is a substantive given … In particular, it is literally *put into practice* throughout the literature from Homer to the playwrights."

Of course, the foregoing is superficial summary. The real action lies in what comes next—that is, in the actual chapters and reflections of this volume. Indeed, we have now arrived at the beginning. For it is in the ancient poems of Homer that this volume begins, moving step by step in the opposite direction to the one in which I've just led us, tracing the concept of dignity from Homer through Roman and medieval thought, into the Renaissance and Enlightenment, and finally to the socially tumultuous nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. So let these prefatory remarks cease. I won't be blamed for further postponing the thrills.

# Chapter 1: Dignity in Homer and Classical Greece
*Patrice Rankine*

> War is war, but dinner should be served on time.  
> — Ukrainian saying

Woven into the distress of Homeric epic, which often laments the terrors of war, the violence of passion, and the desperation of life, are records of ancient customs that hint at a deep respect for culture and human worth. To take but one example, recall Hector's refusal to take wine from his mother when he is bloody from battle. This moment is apt to strike modern readers as trivial. In fact, it reifies important ancient distinctions between war and peace, home and battlefield, and the equally ancient sentiment that to everything, there is a season. In this case, no matter what has occurred in war in Homer's *Iliad*, the poem makes clear there is a time to put away unrest, eat together, and, afterward, revere humanity. That is, there is an injunction to make space for acting in ways that acknowledge mutual value. Thus a

repeated formula throughout the epics to affirm that "after they [often male warriors] had put away their desire for eating and drinking," then comes a time for the bard's entertainment, games, or strategic discussions (e.g., book 12.310).1 As Jasper Griffin describes this element of the epics, "Eating together is a universal mark of union, creating a bond."2

Given such a framework, one begins to wonder whether a concept of human dignity existed as early as Homeric society (twelfth through the eighth centuries bce). Admittedly, there are reasons to balk. Homeric Greeks engaged in ruthless war and acts of pillage, and at times mundanely bought and sold persons at a price, as slaves. Moreover, nowhere do the epics offer anything like explicit, formal criteria of human worth that could be aligned easily to our contemporary western notion of dignity. Homeric epics do not speak explicitly of an inherent or unearned moral status, which status all humans share equally, and which is supposed to ground fundamental human rights or protections.3 Nevertheless, I shall argue that the epics do describe an array of social practices that can be understood as precursors to such formalized criteria. Normative practices, such as sacrifice and reverence for the gods and the treatment of others, demonstrated in such moments as mealtime, suggest that there was indeed a sense in which individuals were "raised above all price," to borrow the Kantian language for human dignity (AK 4:434).

To make this argument, it will be worth framing my chapter in terms of one specific claim regarding human dignity, namely, that dignity culminates in protections through law or through universal declaration, for example, as is true in the Universal Declaration of Human

<sup>1</sup> For all translations, I have used a combination of my own reading of the Greek, along with some aspects that I like from Richmond Lattimore, western's translation, Stanley Lombardo's, and the Loeb translation by A. T. Murray.

<sup>3</sup> In speaking of "formal" criteria, I'm alluding to Remy Debes's distinction between substantive and formal claims of human dignity. Remy Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," *Philosophical Perspectives* 23 (2003): 52.

Rights of 1948. Now, on the one hand, some have thought declarations like these to be mere historical contingencies because dignity itself is contingent. Leonard Harris makes such an argument in his critique of postcoloniality.4 For Harris, postcolonial theorists would make claims like this to restore historically "impotent agents"—blacks, women, non-Europeans—with a kind of dignity, as if dignity itself were not always contingent (255). Harris argues that there are only "casual agents" within contingent contexts, and thus even seeming fundamental moral "truths" like human dignity are correspondingly limited (254). On the other hand, of course, many others think declarations of fundamental protections and rights reflect an important reality about the "true" inner worth of humans.5 But which side of this particular debate is correct doesn't concern me here. For my purposes, it suffices to highlight the tendency to run together the existence of a concept of dignity with its explicit enshrinement in something like a formal declaration of rights. I will show that this tendency risks misleading us when it comes to the Greeks. Thus, consider my hypothesis again, now reformulated: The Greeks *expressed* a belief in human dignity. Although they made no explicit (or philosophical) claim such as the Universal Declaration asserts, they endorsed what Remy Debes calls a "substantive" concept of dignity implicitly in practice; that is, they *treated* human nature as being something that made it the basis of a fundamental worth or status, though they did not theorize about the

<sup>5</sup> As the prevailing view, examples of this alternative claim are in the offing. Thus, consider that "posthuman" theories now speak of the "indignity" that we, as human subjects, might someday avoid by using technological advancement to overcome disease, deprivation, decay, and even death. These posthuman theories strike many as wrongheaded precisely because they turn on a basic misunderstanding of what dignity is. As Charles T. Rubin argues, such an approach takes a "contemptuous attitude to what we actually are" (161), as if to be limited in any way is to suffer the loss of dignity (making a "dignified death" an oxymoron). Charles T. Rubin, "Human Dignity and the Future of Man," in *Human Dignity and Bioethics*, ed. Edmund D. Pellegrino, Adam Schulman, and Thomas W. Merrill (Notre Dame, IN: Notre Dame University Press, 2009), 155–72.

general conceptual features of that status.6 In particular, they typically did not see the dishonor of others—such as non-Greeks or enemies in terms of either impotence (as one might see an orphan in ancient times) or the hyperhuman (giants, Cyclops, etc., which also is to deny humanity to an other). On the contrary, the Greeks asserted a substance of dignity to be offered to others, even to those unlike themselves. The substance of this dignity is a precursor to a formal claim such as Kant's.

To be perfectly clear, then, the goal is not to argue for some hitherto unnoticed explicit *doctrine* of dignity in Greek thought. Despite the formalization of so many philosophical concepts by ancient Greek philosophers, especially Plato and Aristotle, human dignity was not one of them.7 Indeed, there is simply no succinct language for such a concept. The Greek adjective *axios* is the closest approximation to the Latin word that will come to be translated as "dignity," *dignus* (adjective), or *dignitas* (abstract noun) (which itself does not go as far as a universal or legal claim).8 And yet the word *axios*, derived from the verb *agō*, "lead," "carry," "hold," has to do with the value *given* to persons and things, as with "worth" in English. It is no surprise, then, that what has "worth" (*axios*) in Greek is something with an equivalence to other things, in terms of value. The advent of coinage in Greece allowed for a correspondence of the item of worth to a monetary value. Thus a diamond, of a certain monetary value, also has *worth* within society, in terms of those things with which it can be exchanged. And the same connotation of *axios* is applied to people in Homer. This is only a connotation because it is clear that human reason and emotions

<sup>6</sup> See Debes's introduction to this volume.

<sup>7</sup> See George Kateb, *Human Dignity* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2011). When formalization of human dignity first occurred is as yet an open question and one being explored in this volume. The philosophical formalization might be attributed to Kant (see Sensen in this volume), but the legal claim of universal human dignity does not occur until after World War II, as LaVaque-Manty argues in this volume.

<sup>8</sup> See Griffin in this volume.

differentiate us from inanimate things. At the same time, the listener hears that a handful of heroes are not worth—not equal in value to— Hector.9 The statement is an evaluation of Hector's military prowess and, from what we know of Hector throughout the poem, his own system of values, which prioritizes the gods, family, the city, and his fellow man. Because of these values, Hector is worth much to his city, Troy—more than money, more than other men. In short, persons, like material objects, have value in comparison to other objects—and even to other persons.10 Moreover, "worth" is cognate to the Sanskrit *vart-*, Latin *verteri*, "to turn," which takes on the meaning of "to become," as in changing or "turning" into something else. The link between "worth" and "becoming" (*verteri*, and also *ago*) already hints at *axios* in Greek as *not* an intrinsic value but as something one moves toward, something even earned, further buttressing a sense of value that comes about in relation to other things. *Axios* is thus not the equivalent to human dignity as that concept is generally understood today. Instead, *axios* points to the complex of words linked to human value in Homeric society. Such value is always contingent, comparative, not intrinsic. It might be argued that each individual *was* raised above price, such that a slave in Homer (Eumaeus) is understood to be (and to have been) noble. Conversely, a noble could become a slave. Yet there was no widespread threat to human dignity that necessitated the philosophical position.

Indeed, the Greek *axios* slowly became an attribute linked to social class or rank in society. By the fifth century, for example, abstract forms of *axios* (e.g., *axiōma* and *axiōsis*) began to appear in Herodotus and the playwrights and were clearly references to the "honor" or reputation of persons, making its ultimate meaning very close to the later

<sup>9</sup> Liddell and Scott's entry for Homer 8.234.

<sup>10</sup> The parallel passage cited in Liddell and Scott is from Herodotus, where Solon implicitly corrects Croesus's sense of what is valuable—namely, noble stock—for the worth of common Athenian youth, Cleobis and Biton, who sacrificed their lives by taking on the yoke of oxen to make sure their mother arrived at the temple of Delphi. See Herodotus 1.31–32. Whether their good behavior is a result of their Athenianness begs the question of human dignity, despite the emphasis on their low social standing that might evidence universal dignity.

Latin *dignus*/*dignitas. Dignus*, which is used in Latin much the way *axios* was used in Greek, stems from a complex of words having to do with appearance: Greek *doceō, doxa*, and Latin *decet, decus*, "seemly," "comely," derived from the Sanskrit word having to do with fame, *daças*. And obviously nothing in this family of meaning points to a sense of dignity as a moral worth or stature that transcends contingencies, with which a person might perhaps be born.

Despite the absence of a universal or formal claim to human dignity, however, or even the explicit language that would support such a claim, it would be a mistake to conclude that the substance of a concept of dignity did not exist in Homeric Greece. In other words, just because we don't find a *theory* of dignity in Homer, we should not think the *content* is completely absent. Dignity is a concept similar to what Orlando Patterson argues regarding "freedom," in *Freedom in the Making of Western Civilization*, if only in the following respect: like freedom, dignity is a widespread human value that is not articulated, argued for, or formalized until extensive threats to it arise, along with the possibility of its loss.11 Certainly honor can be lost in Patterson's analysis, and slavery brings its indignity. Here I am simply echoing Patterson's argument for "freedom" as that argument pertains to dignity: widespread threats to Greek freedom, according to Patterson, occur in the fifth century bce, when the rise of chattel slavery suddenly made peoples vulnerable who hitherto had not faced the possibility of enslavement.12 Although the Greeks (from 1600 bce to at least the Hellenistic period) were not immune to violations of human dignity—which is to say, they did act in ways that today we would say violate dignity—still, there was no cultural catastrophe so devastating as to require its formal amplification *for all Greeks*, whether in legal or other discursive terms. The incidental slave, captured enemy, or fall of a city were not enough to cause these casual agents to come to a universal

<sup>12</sup> Patterson, *Freedom*.

formulation of what they had lost. Instead, human dignity is a substantive given, and it is evident in several respects, from Homeric epic through the classical period in Greece. In particular, it is literally *put into practice* throughout the literature from Homer to the playwrights.

Thus, while it might seem that the treatment of Achilles or Hector and their peers in Homeric epic stems only from their elevated status within society, their nobility, or their fame, I will argue that a close inspection of how the wider world is treated belies such a reading. Alongside the representation of these high-ranked individuals, the treatment of slaves, animals, and the material world shows that the value extended to the noble classes is to a great extent also afforded to others.

## The Homeric Context: Achilles's Treatment of Hector in the *Iliad*

The last book of Homer's *Iliad* has as its centerpiece a scene that is one of the most poignant expressions of human dignity. The eighth century bce epic poem opens with Achilles's *menis*, a cursed (*oulomenēn*) "anger" that "brought countless pains on the Achaians, and hurled the strong souls of many heroes into the depths." The immediate reason for Achilles's anger is that he feels he has suffered the violation of his honor (*timē*), his contextual claim as a chieftain, at the hands of Agamemnon, who has come to Troy on behalf of Agamemnon's brother Menelaus to retrieve Helen. In Homer, Helen is the cause of the conflict, whereas the classical Athenian historian Thucydides attributes the war to Agamemnon's ambition, which his formidable navy affirmed.13 Archaeological remains corroborate ongoing conflict at the site of Troy leading into the twelfth century bce. Whatever the cause of the culminating battles, Homer allows a focus on a culture and its

<sup>13</sup> See Thucydides 1.1–23.

values, the violation of which leads to Achilles's anger within the epic, poetic frame. This context allows for a focus on what human dignity might look like in the hands of the Greeks.

By the opening of book 1 of Homer's *Iliad*, the Greek forces have sacked the stronghold of Eëtion, and Agamemnon has taken as his war prize (*geras*) Chryseis, the daughter of a priest of Apollo. When her father Chryses comes to retrieve Chryseis, Agamemnon not only insults the holy man, but later threatens to take Achilles's *geras*, Briseis, should he be forced to return his. The threat to Achilles—of the loss of Briseis—is the first of a series of slights—perceived or real—to Achilles (breaches of his honor) in the *Iliad*. The audience soon discovers (later in book 1 and in book 9) that Achilles's excessive reaction is really about his own mortality, the poignancy of war revealing both the fundamentally human reality of impending death and the few consolations that living might bring in the meanwhile: the esteem that others can grant, rewards for our labor, trust in social, cultural, and legal processes, to name only a few. Charles Rubin's framework of the "hyperhuman" would see indignity in mortality and death itself; for the Greeks, the treatment of the person in light of these realities is where dignity is preserved.

If book 1 establishes the motif of Achilles's *menis*, then the twentyfourth and final book of the *Iliad* resolves this central theme. Whatever the deeper causes, Achilles immediately refuses to fight the Trojans because of Agamemnon's theft of Briseis, and the result is the loss of the best warrior on the battlefield. The enemy brings fire to the ships of Achilles's forces, the Myrmidons, and this in turn incites Patroclus to enter the battle (in book 16), dressed as Achilles. In book 1 and throughout, we learn that along with Briseis, Patroclus is the only other person at Troy dear to Achilles; some aspects of the reception tradition (pottery, for example) even have Patroclus as Achilles's lover. The intimate friendship or love relationship sets up a catastrophic loss for Achilles when Hector, the most beloved of king Priam's fifty sons and the foremost fighter of the Trojans, kills Patroclus. Patroclus' death sets the stage for the central battle of the *Iliad*, that between Achilles

and Hector (book 22), which Achilles wins. By this point in the narrative, Achilles's cursed and overweening anger first at Agamemnon, then at Hector, but essentially a struggle with his own mortality—is such that he begins to drag the corpse of Hector around the city of Troy to exact vengeance for Patroclus's death. He drags Hector's body three times initially, when he first kills Hector, and continues to do so for twelve days. He refuses to eat or drink during that time.

My argument, in light of the foregoing summary, is that the violation of a substantive human dignity is evident in Achilles's implicit rejection of the idea of forgiveness and reconciliation. He would express remorse—or at least cessation of his activities—in his willingness to eat and to allow Hector's family to bury their son. Instead, he performs actions roundly repudiated throughout the culture, whether we look to the actions that the gods model, or normative behaviors that demonstrate where Achilles has gone wrong.

Book 24 opens with Achilles's wayward ritual, one that replaces the normative processes that preserve a sense of value (or dignity), practices of assembly, meals, and sleep:

Patroclus' funeral games were done, and the hosts scattered, each and every man going to his own ship. Surely they provided for food and delighted in sleep. Not Achilles. He wept at the memory of his beloved companion, nor did sleep that tames all take him, but he turned this way and that, longing for the manhood and valiant might of Patroclus. He wound through the memories of all he had done with Patroclus and all the pain he had borne. Achilles thought about his own experiences in men's wars in grievous waves. Remembering these things he would cry profusely, turning to and fro in his bed, now on his side, now on his back, and now on his face. Then again he would get up and roam along the shore of the sea, distraught.

At daybreak, as the sun shone over the sea and the beaches, he'd be ready. Every time, he would yoke his swift horses to the chariot, and bind Hector behind the chariot and drag him. When he had hauled him three times around the dirt heap coving [Patroclus] the dead son of Menoetius, he would pause again in his tent, but he would allow Hector to be outstretched on his face down in the dirt. (24.1–18)

Into this madness of Achilles's sacrilegious ritual enters Priam, an aged, wise, and highly esteemed ruler, to retrieve the body of his son. The fact of this juxtaposition of dead and living, defeated and victorious, is the crux of why the scene matters to the substantive discussion of human dignity. Dignity as a substantive virtue in Homeric society underpins the passage. Achilles has, for a time, ignored the ritual economy of war and peace—enemies, but human—and has violated the worth of his adversary. It is precisely a restoration of worth that Priam would seem to request. Thus, Priam slips unseen, with the help of the gods, who support the restoration of dignity, into enemy territory.14 Arriving at Achilles's hut, Priam "clasped in his hands [Achilles'] knees, and kissed his hands, the terrible (*deinas*), man-slaying hands that had slain his many sons."15

This phrasing of Priam's plea, along with many aspects of the passage, is easily read as a substantive entry into the subject of human dignity for the Greeks. In "Dignity's Gauntlet," Remy Debes cites the chorus of *Antigone* on the wondrousness of human beings, who are "*supremely* valuable." The use of *deinos*—which I translate above as "terrible" in both the choral ode of *Antigone* and this passage is not accidental. "Many are the wonders," the *deina*, but none is more "terrible" or wondrous than the human being, as the chorus of *Antigone* puts it. Similar to the human being (*anthropos*) in the chorus of *Antigone*, Achilles's

<sup>14</sup> I am perhaps evading an important aspect of the passage, namely the role of the gods in dignity and its restoration. I hope to handle this to some extent through the notion of reverence.

hands are not simply *deinas* because of the terrible damage they can cause. Rather, these terrible hands are a sign of humankind's capacity for both the destructive and the wondrous, a range conveyed in a word with no parallel, *deinos*. As Debes puts it with regard to the tragic chorus, "Of course, those lines [from *Antigone* pertaining to man's distinctiveness] are juxtaposed against the tragic plot of that play and all of Creon's folly and hubris."16 Similarly, the word *deinas* in *Iliad* 24 conveys the damage that Achilles has done, but like the choral ode in *Antigone*, it does so against the backdrop of awe.

So consider again Priam's approach to Achilles in a fuller context:

Great Priam slipped into the tent without being noticed. He went right up to Achilles and clasped in his hands his knees, and kissed his hands, the terrible (*deinas*), man-slaying hands that had slain his many sons. As when confusion (*atē*) comes on a man, who in his country killed another human being and goes to the home of others, to some rich man, and amazement comes on those who look on him, so was Achilles struck with wonder at the sight of godlike Priam. They marveled (*thambēsin*) at each other. They stared at each other. (24.477–84)

The simile compares human to human, whereas most Homeric similes are human to animal. The poet compares the sight of Priam to that of a murderer, and by extension Achilles to that of a man of wealth. The inversion is telling from the standpoint of human value. Achilles, the murderer, is an object of wonder, as if a rich man; Priam, a rich man, is likened to the murderer but also evokes wonder. In normative terms the murderer is *removed* from a place of value in society; he leaves his community, cast out, for a time of purification. The rich man, in those same terms, could be said to be in an *elevated*

<sup>16</sup> Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," 52.

place of value, that is, of greater "worth," at least within community. The community values a rich man more than it does a murderer, and rightly so. We might return here to the concern expressed earlier in this chapter that perhaps only some, for example, the elite, the rich, have a high comparative worth, or are *axios*, in Homeric society. Nevertheless, the juxtaposition of the one removed from society, the murderer, with the rich man, who has *axios* measurable in monetary terms, does not in this passage point to comparative value. That is, the murder is *worth* no less. Rather, the comparison shows that both the rich man and the murderer are *deinos*. Awe is what equalizes both. Though removed from his local community or *ethnos*, the murderer is not removed from a space of *human* worth: he in fact arrives elsewhere, though outside of his own community, to a place of care. Nor *because of his money* is the rich man "raised above all price," the Kantian claim of incommensurable value to which Debes returns in his discussions of human dignity. Rather, the rich man embodies a kind of value that approximates virtue, as only a person (as opposed to an animal) can achieve wealth and has the power to wield it well or destructively. The rich man is *deinos*. The murderer, though, is also *deinos* and is valued simultaneously, in spite of his act—counterintuitively, in fact is valued *because* of it. Many the wonders, but nothing is more *deinos* than humankind, in the ability both to build and to destroy, to be awesome, and awful.

Similar to the rich man, Priam is a ruler of a kingdom who has enough wealth to have attained concubines for fifty sons and as many slaves. Given the depletion of energy and resources that comes with war, which is a wielding of wealth and power to destructive ends, Priam is on the brink of losing all, not unlike the murderer. Paradoxically, given his former status, Priam—virtually a pauper in terms of his loss stares at Achilles in the same way one would stare at the man of means. Achilles, though, is in fact not a rich man but herein the murderer, even if the killing occurs within the sanctioned context of war. What an unlikely comparison! Each man is *deinos* for the way in which the

condition of each—belonging and the loss of belonging, elevation and demotion—illuminates broader aspects of a shared, human condition.

Throughout the passage the language of wonder is repeated: *deinos, thambos*. Achilles, now like the rich man, is something *deinos*, something rare in nature. If an expression of human dignity is the extent to which we treat others as an object of wonder, or reverence, then the wonder with which Priam and Achilles stare at each other is telling; they marvel *at each other, thambeō*. The emphasis in the passage on their visual regard for one another gives pause, as they momentarily interrupt the normal course of things—war, their mutual loss, their status as enemies—to take in all that it means for enemies to inhabit the same space and status. It might sound odd to reverence a murderer, whether the one within the simile, or Achilles himself, but this is just the right term. Reverence might be defined as "the well-developed capacity to have the feelings of awe, respect, and shame when these are the right feelings to have."17 Many the awe-inspiring and awful things, but nothing is more awe-inspiring or awful than a person.

From the passage, three interlinked aspects of the substance of human dignity, that is, what it looks like in practice even if Homer never formulates a thesis on what it is, are evident. First, that Achilles and Priam regard each other as one would wonder at the rich man or the murderer—is telling. They share the status of enemies, but this very fact is why the moment is poignant. Achilles's and Priam's common status as enemies paradoxically points to their *stature* as human beings.18 Each person has lost a loved one in war, and their common *loss* unites them, momentarily, in grief.

If regard, wonder, or reverence, is the first clue to human dignity in this passage, then "stature" as the reason for this wonder is the second. Although the idea of the *imago Dei*, the human being as made in the

<sup>17</sup> Paul Woodruff, *Reverence: Renewing a Forgotten Virtue* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 8.

<sup>18</sup> Kateb, *Human Dignity*.

"image of God," cannot be said to be operative here in the same way that it is in a Judeo-Christian context, the wonder, the *deinos*, is a result of a certain stature even in Homer.19 It is telling that the same epithets denoting godlikeness are used of Hector upon his death. Jasper Griffin's comments are relevant here:

The immediate juxtaposition of "god-like Hector" and "acts of humiliation" enables the poet to bring out, without sentimentality, the pathos of the greatest possible fall for a man, from god-like status to humiliation and helplessness.20

In an oral context where epithets often do not add meaning and sometimes serve merely metrical considerations, it is important to add that Priam is *consistently* "in the image of a god," *theoeidēs*, or great, *megas*, throughout the passage. Griffin's comments regarding Hector extend both to Priam and to Achilles in this passage. The "godlike" reminds us of how far they have fallen in status, and yet their stature as worthy of value has not changed.

So what accounts for this stature: the fact that even those who have individual status as enemies, as murderers, as kings, are to be treated in a certain way? The answer to this is the third aspect of dignity in the passage: the men *share* in reason, a sense of shame (akin to reverence), and an ability to pity one another. While reason might be privileged in some contexts (*cogito ergo sum*), the interplay between reason and shame in the ancient world is critical to Greek selfhood. Dignity discourse often focuses on the first of these, reason, and yet shame and pity are linked to reason in the Homeric text.21 Because Priam and Achilles have shared human stature, evidenced in reason, pity, and shame—all of which led to a *mutual* reverence—they are part

<sup>19</sup> Later in this volume, Bonnie Kent addresses dignity vis-à-vis the *imago Dei*.

of a moral community of unearned worth.22 "Remember your father," Priam says to Achilles, also, tellingly, *theoeidēs*, in the "image of a god." Given their shared stature and loss (ontological and experiential), it is fitting that Achilles have a sense of shame toward the gods, *aideio theous*, and pity (*eleeō*) Priam. These men are human not only because they reason, but also because they have a developed and cultivated sense of pity and shame. The wonder that comes from reciprocally recognizing in the other—from reason, awe, and a sense of mutual suffering—a human condition reflects the substance of dignity in Homer as a "special value to humans."23 Achilles and Priam: each has human dignity, qua status, as a unique individual with special circumstances of loss, and qua stature, as beings of equal, unearned value. Recognizing this, Achilles must now return Hector's body.

The poignant exchange between Achilles and Priam is one of three types of human relationships in the Homeric poems that evidence a regard for what might be identified as the substance of human dignity in archaic Greece. This first relationship, one that Achilles and Priam represent, is that of enemies toward each other. Similar to the other two relationships, the treatment of enemies throughout the poems points to the possibility of dignity's opposite, the possibility of the "erasure from the space of value."24 Burial and other ritual aspects of the treatment of enemies hint at a substantive sense of the value of all human life. In fact, if the exchange between Achilles and Priam is a moment of reconciliation and the high point of the epic, it is possible to find dignity's opposite in Achilles's treatment of Hector, the desecration of his body. The gods, particularly Apollo, express how appalled they are at Achilles's behavior in language that anticipates the right order of things at the epic's close. Apollo argues that Hector honored the gods

<sup>24</sup> Debes, "Human Dignity," on Kateb.

in life, and thus they are to feel shame in holding back from helping him now. Achilles is clearly out of step with the norms of Homeric society, which include the value given to one who had reason, felt pain and pleasure (emotions), and is *deinos* (had loved ones, did wonderful and destructive things):

His mind is not right (*phrenes, enaisimoi*), and his intentions (*noēma*) are bent, like a wild lion, who goes among the sacrificial beasts of men with great force and fierceness in order to take his feast. In this way Achilles has destroyed pity (*eleos*) and has no shame (*aidos*). This condition harms men greatly and does not profit them. (24.40–45)

The human-to-animal simile that follows offsets the human-to-human simile of the exchange between Achilles and Priam. Reason, the thoughts and intentions of a human being, it might be said, separates people from raging lions and other animals. Reason, of course, is the "uniqueness claim" associated with human dignity. Similar to a lion, a raging Achilles lacks the "inwardness" that makes of a beast a sacrificial animal (*mēlon*), something more than food. But reason does not stand alone. It enables a developed sense of shame, and pity. Whereas Priam asked Achilles to have pity (*eleos*) and a sense of shame (*aidos*) toward him, Apollo notes that Achilles lacks *eleos* or *aidos* toward Hector. Put in terms of dignity, Achilles has erased Hector from the space of value. His treatment of his enemy has reached a point of no return, the type of crisis that prompts divine intervention throughout Homeric epic.

Thus the example of Achilles makes a positive case for a substantive understanding of human dignity in Homeric society. His mistreatment of Hector, whom Achilles wants to give to dogs and birds of prey to devour, demonstrates what it would mean for a person within this social setting to dip below normative value, being now not worthy, *axios*, of good treatment. Through the gods, the presence of Priam, and Achilles's capitulation, the poet establishes this treatment as a violation

of the norm. The example of Achilles is emblematic of an approach to human dignity found throughout the Homeric poems.

Although space here does not allow for an exhaustive study, I will briefly move from the arguments for a substantive claim to human dignity in Homer to an overview of other cases of the claim. These cases are the (1) treatment of slaves and the treatment of the less-thanhuman, which would include animals, and (2) the natural landscape, the environment.

## Examples of Violations to Dignity from the *Odyssey*

There are slaves in Homeric society, and this fact calls human dignity into question. Briseis and Chryseis are slaves, prizes won in battle and not free to come and go at their own will and pleasure. At the same time, the contrast in their treatment—the former loved by Achilles and the latter merely Agamemnon's possession—demonstrates in brief the contrast in dignity studies between "unearned worth" (to love, cherish, value) and "equal worth" (to rule, to be able to enslave, to be able to have different social statuses within a class structure). As Debes explains, unearned worth is a metaphysical or conceptual claim, whereas equal worth is a normative claim.25 As a normative standard, a society might not extend equal worth to every individual—a king is in tangible ways worth more than a beggar—while at the same time recognizing certain claims for all (slaves, women, and so on). In Homeric society as much as in modern parallels, how one treats the slave—the pauper, the beggar—is critical to the question of whether the person is reverenced or erased from the space of value. It is difficult to make this point without giving an impression of condoning slavery. Nevertheless, evidence abounds that slavery, at least as it pertains

<sup>25</sup> Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," 59.

to the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, was at times the best recourse available to many members of society, such as the poor, the orphaned, and the defeated in war.26 Whereas the battlefield context of the *Iliad* does not feature slaves and therefore does not give abundant examples of their treatment, notwithstanding the women won in battle, Homer's *Odyssey* allows entry into domestic spaces where slaves abound in ancient Greece and even in Homeric society. In this context, the slave Eumaeus and his reflections are of critical value.

In the discussion of Hector above, his mistreatment was only for a time, a result of a momentary lapse on the part of Achilles. In contrast to this, Eumaeus endures years of mistreatment at the hands of the suitors, in the absence of his master Odysseus. Upon Odysseus's return to his homeland of Ithaca from ten years of war and ten years of wandering, Eumaeus, his slave, secures Odysseus's entry into his own home. The story of how Eumaeus became a slave points to human dignity and its erasure. Unlike his current handlers, Odysseus treated Eumaeus well, and despite his current condition, Eumaeus seems to believe that Odysseus, although disguised as a beggar, is deserving of good treatment. Similar to Odysseus's incidental status, slavery for Eumaeus is a condition into which he has simply fallen. His current status belies his true worth. Eumaeus's father, Ctesius, was a man of status *epieikelos athanatoisin*, "like the gods." Ctesius is a ruler of not one but two cities in Syria, but the advent of Phoenician traders disrupts domestic bliss. These greedy men (*trōktoi*) seduce Eumaeus's nursemaid, who is also Phoenician and eager to reconnect to her group. The traders take the Phoenician woman and the young Eumaeus away from his homeland and sell them for profit (more money, more food).

Given the distinctiveness or moral specialness claim in discussions of human dignity (which has been evident thus far from Homer's *Iliad*),

<sup>26</sup> Patrice Rankine, "Odysseus as Slave: The Ritual of Domination and Social Death in Homeric Society," in *Reading Ancient Slavery*, ed. Richard Alston, Edith Hall, and Laura Proffitt (New York: Bristol, 2011), 34–50.

it should not be surprising that *trōktoi*, the greedy Phoenician men, is linguistically rooted in eating: for example, animals eating meat raw. The connection to Achilles, who threatens to eat Hector's body raw, is easily drawn. Like Achilles, the Phoenicians practice a vice; they do not know limits. They are out of step with their broader human community. This is in fact the problem with traders as they are represented in Homeric society: they disrupt a value system by conferring value on coinage and trade based on approximate value.

Eumaeus, like anyone in human society, finds himself at some point at the mercy of others. If one is bereft of homeland or a means of reentry (like the murderer in the Iliadic passage), in a frontier outside of cities and their civic order, the kindness of strangers (e.g., kings, rich men, that is, persons of higher material worth and those of more stable statuses in society) is paramount. The poet describes Eumaeus as a man "who could have commanded a platoon in war" (14.25). In other words, his unequal status in society as a slave does not destroy his unearned worth as a person. Slavery disrupts only his human *potential*, not his *humanness*. One might go as far as to say that Eumaeus, if not "esteemed beyond all price," is richly valued, despite the suitors' treatment of him. His father certainly richly valued him. He has noble birth, and the poet addresses him by apostrophe, the second-person address reserved for a few beloved characters in Homeric poetry. The fact that Eumaeus spends his time as a slave "cutting the tanned leather to size" does not make him any less godlike (*dios*), even as he speaks of his master Odysseus with an awe similar to that which is owed to Eumaeus (*antitheos*).

Odysseus's disguise as a beggar, necessary for his re-entry into Ithaca, allows the audience some view of the domestic space in Homeric society, where slaves and other dependents are present. Odysseus's disguise and his lies about having been a slave express a set of cultural truths, and in particular underline his shared humanity with Eumaeus.27

<sup>27</sup> Rankine, "Odysseus as Slave," 34–50.

Odysseus's higher social value—his status—as a king does not ultimately protect him from the potential violation of his unearned membership in a moral community. That is, he is now similar to a slave. What protects him from mistreatment, now that he is not a ruler? On the other side, Eumaeus has undergone both kind and unkind treatment, and he chooses to extend hospitality to the stranger whom he does not yet recognize as his own master:

Stranger (*xenos*), even if someone worse than you came, it would not be right (*themis*) for me to dishonor a *xenos*. From Zeus come all *xenoi* and beggars. Our gifts to them are small but dear. This is how it is with slaves because we are always in fear, especially when young kings rule. (14.56–61)

A sense of what is right (*themis*) even toward those of lesser social status ("someone worse than you," *kakiōn*) drives Eumaeus's thinking, intention, and practice toward strangers (*xenos*). Strangers and beggars are like slaves because they are dependent upon the kindness of those of higher social status or those more tightly woven into the community. Odysseus weaves a false tale of how he too was sold into slavery and made to work (*ergon*) as the telos of his value. These stories of Odysseus as slave, though lies, link up with Eumaeus's narrative and thus express the deeper truth regarding human value in the Homeric poems.28

The treatment of enemies emblematic of the exchange between Achilles and Priam, along with the treatment of slaves and all those of lesser rank in society (strangers, beggars, the poor, the orphaned), is a case for the substance of human dignity in Homeric society. Both kinds of treatment point to the human being's unearned worth, and specifically, something like unearned membership in a shared (human) moral community.

<sup>28</sup> Rankine, “Odysseus as Slave.”

The third and final relationship to consider in Homeric lore is the treatment of the less-than-human, which is an aspect of the philosophical discourse of dignity attributable to Kateb.29 As he argues, because of the stature of the human being, which is linked to reason, the ability to express reverence and pity, and even the ability to protect others, we are given stewardship of nature, namely "the impossible task of making nature be *to* itself."30 Stewardship of nature is an expression of reverence, or awe, a sense that nature, like man, is itself *deinon*, a "marvelous thing." As it pertains to the Greek context, the Homeric poems show a profound regard for this aspect of dignity. The presence of dogs in the domestic space of the *Odyssey*, for example, is canny because of what it might be read to signal about the way the stature of a person impacts his or her surroundings.

In one of the passages discussed above, where Odysseus first appears in Eumaeus's hut, dogs rush the stranger. Eumaeus shoos them. While the incident could be treated as one of those throwaway, possible subplots that Eric Auerbach talks about in terms of the "retarding" style of epic narrative (with all possible plots foregrounded and none subordinated),31 Eumaeus's shooing of the dogs is more telling than it might seem at first glance. As Eumaeus himself puts it, he is accountable (*elenchō*) for the hounds. Had the dogs mauled the stranger of low status, Eumaeus (or his master) would have been liable, and he already has enough grief (*algea, stonachas*) in his life, having been bereft of homeland, family, the safety of status, and even Odysseus over the foregoing twenty years.

Of course, Eumaeus's relationship to these nameless dogs parallels that of Odysseus to Argus, the faithful dog that the master left behind for twenty years, who now lies in lice and disregarded in dung that

could have been used to fertilize the land. (There is such an economizing of resources in the Homeric worldview.) And yet Argus cannot die until he recognizes that his master, even disguised, has returned (17.290–305). Such is his loyalty. Through the animal, the third expression of how human beings treat others, the poet makes a deliberate though as yet untheorized point about dignity.

## Precursors to Universal Dignity in Classical Greece after Homer

My aim here has been to raise the premise of a substantive claim to human dignity in Homeric society, the fictive context from which much of our sense of preclassical Greek society after the Bronze Age derives. Rather than a history of the emergence of dignity, the Homeric poems and context show dignity operating as a substantive claim from the beginnings of Near Eastern and early European societies.32 What would be left for philosophers is the theorization of dignity as a formal or theoretical concern. In the pages that follow, I would like to suggest that there are further seeds of the discourse of dignity in classical Greece. It will be left to other scholars to amply these claims or reject them.

In many areas of thought, Homer, as Eric Havelock argues, is a kind of preface to Plato.33 The moral, ethical, and social arrangements in these poems are a baseline to which the Greek playwrights and, later, Plato and Aristotle will return. Greek popular morality can to a great extent be derived from these poems, and examples abound: the playwrights' indirect references to Homer in such plays as Euripides's *Hecuba*; Socrates's citation of Hector's bravery in death, in the *Apology*; or Aristotle's use of examples for moral persuasion, in *Rhetoric*. Thus if there is any substantive evidence of human dignity in the Greek

<sup>32</sup> Rankine, "Odysseus as Slave."

<sup>33</sup> Eric Havelock, *Preface to Plato* (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1982).

context, finding that evidence would mean starting with Homer. From there, we might draw examples from the playwrights for places where a demonstration of what looks like dignity might be found. Each of the playwrights presents ample evidence of dignity and, what is more, its violation, given the context of ritual sacrifice and loss at the festival of Dionysus.

Examples from Aeschylus might include Agamemnon's violation of a certain reverence for the life of his daughter Iphigenia (*Oresteia*), a sacrifice that resounds even as far off as the Roman poet Lucretius in the first century bce as an instance of religion's failure "to guard and protect what has dignity";34 In the *Oresteia* (458 bce), Aeschylus is interested in the shift from greatness to defeat, such as is found in Agamemnon's downfall. This concern perhaps parallels the decline of great aristocratic families that marks the historical advent of democratic society. If Agamemnon loses his status and faces the violation of his dignity in his manner of death in the first play of the *Oresteia*, by the end of the trilogy Orestes has not only restored his family's honor in his slaughter of his mother Clytemnestra, his father's killer, but he has also yielded to the power of the Athenian state, where the Furies protect the ancient blood-price for Clytemnestra's death at the court of the Areopagus. Aeschylus's *Persians* is also important to the discussion, as a play that reifies the deep divide between Greek and non-Greek, what Edith Hall calls the invention of the barbarian (the beginning of an ancient orientalism),35 which would continue throughout the classical period. And yet, despite the inadvertent inscription of the Persians as "other" in the play, the profound humanity of their plight—the groaning, Atossa's lamentations, the general sense of this foreign people's loss in status as a result of the Persian Wars—is central to Aeschylus's representation.

<sup>34</sup> Debes, "Human Dignity," 60.

<sup>35</sup> Edith Hall, *Inventing the Barbarian: Greek Self-Definition through Tragedy* (Oxford University Press), 1989.

Any place where a shift in status attends, the substance of dignity can be felt because such a shift calls into question the worth of the person, his or her stature as raised above all price. If there were a moral community of unearned worth that transcends the local community (the *ethnos*) or the city-state (the *polis*), a shift in status would exposes the limits of the local context. For example, Euripides's *Hecuba* (424 bce) has been one play that features the degradation of the captive, slave woman, but it is only one of many.36 Hecuba's shift from queen to slave, similar to Eumaeus's experience, disrupts how *axia* or "worth it" she might be to her own society, but it also enables her to claim a value that transcends her local environment. How a society treats enemies, slaves, and the less-than-human matters to dignity, and thus Hecuba indicts the Greeks because of their poor treatment of her. In fact, the playwrights could be said to be working through the very problem of human dignity, even though the historical circumstances of fifthcentury Athens engendered no deeper reaction, no more profound theorization, than they offered.

Similar to Eumaeus and even Odysseus in Homer's *Odyssey*, Hecuba has happened into a shift in status, from queen to slave, as a result of the fall of Troy. The circumstances of the play have been read as an ongoing dehumanization of Hecuba. As if slavery were not enough, pressure is put on her throughout the play, such that continued insult leads to behavior not becoming of a queen. First, in addition to suffering a shift in status to slave, she learns that the Greeks will kill her daughter, Polyxena, in a sacrifice over the tomb of Achilles. The externalization of a process of reason comes in the Greeks' debate about whether or not to conduct this sacrifice, until Odysseus, a *democharistes* ("crowd-pleaser"), casts the dice. Euripides, similar to Thucydides in his treatment of Cleon (a *demagogos* or "demagogue" who sways the community with arguments toward questionable ends), casts

<sup>36</sup> Patrice Rankine, *Ulysses in Black: Ralph Ellison, Classicism, and African American Literature* (University of Wisconsin Press), 2006.

Odysseus in a complicated role, that of a sophist who might be making the weaker argument appear the stronger. Hecuba appeals to the same question of how far the ethical community extends to what Philoctetes prompts in that play. She claims to have once saved Odysseus's life at Troy, respecting his stature as human being over his status as an enemy in war. Odysseus rejects the argument, offering no friendship in war, no treaty among enemies. In the play, Hecuba suffers what might be deemed to be existential harm because she is outside of any and every community: her Trojan community is lost, and the Greeks respect no treaty or bond with her. What is more, she discovers that her ally and friend in Troy, Polymester, has killed her son Polydorus, whom she and Priam sent away from Troy to him for safekeeping at the beginning of the war. Now all is lost, and Hecuba resorts to the primitive justice of vengeance with which the *Oresteia* opened (that is, an appeal to human rights, *laws* that extend to strangers and slaves, more than the *ethical* practices we saw in Homer, etc.). In the absence of dignity as part of ethics, Hecuba is subject to existential harm, but this is a tragic frame, a space of crisis, not the normal state of things in classical Greece.

The impact of the democratic shift on ethics—the treatment of enemies, friendships, and relationships to the state, which Hecuba calls "equality under the law"—continue to be felt throughout the playwrights. In Sophocles's *Philoctetes* (409 bce), Neoptolemus, son of the late Achilles, faces a moral dilemma in his attempt to retrieve Herakles's bow and arrow from Philoctetes, whom the Greeks, led by Odysseus, abandoned on a deserted island at the beginning of the Trojan War because of his festering wound. They have left him there for ten years, but a prophecy now reveals that they cannot defeat Troy without the bow and arrows. The moral dilemma comes when Odysseus enjoins Neoptolemus to retrieve the bow and arrows. Spending time with Philoctetes causes a shift for Neoptolemus, what amounts to an *ephebic* rite of passage that challenges his ethics. Not only has he come to pity Philoctetes, with *pathos* as a starting point for the regard of the other, but Neoptolemus has also come to regard Philoctetes as a friend because of the man's friendship with his own father. That is, if Greek popular morality, as Kenneth Dover put it, calls for helping friends and harming enemies, why would Neoptolemus continue the ongoing harm that the Greeks have done to Philoctetes, who is a friend of his friends?37 Where human friendships end—how far the civic community extends to a broader human community—is unsolvable in the play's final resolution, as it is in *Hecuba. Philoctetes* attempts a solution through a deus ex machina, in which Herakles, now a god, appears to tell the Greek community that they need his bow and arrow *as well as* Philoctetes himself. No warrior should be left behind; Philoctetes has worth, despite the decade of devaluation that left him bereft of friends, food, and shelter, and a legacy commensurate to his former status. The loss of worth that a Greek noble can endure challenges the system of values in the classical texts, just as it did in the Homeric context.

## Epilogue

It is worth returning to the search for a formal claim to dignity among the Greeks with which I opened. The evidence of dignity as a substantive reality in Homeric society and in classical Greece should be clear. People have dignity throughout the ancient Mediterranean and Near East, if we base this on the cultural standards for how enemies are treated; how strangers, slaves, and beggars are to be treated; and how these societies regard the less-than-human. Thus, while the Homeric epics represent Greek society at its best—even in the context of war, wandering, and the bad behavior of rulers in the absence of the kind king—the representation of violations to human dignity in tragedy gives deliberate pause to the emerging concern of a widespread dehumanization of others. This existential threat to human dignity results from the premise of imperialism that marks the classical

period. The playwrights, along with Thucydides, whose descriptive and diagnostic treatment of Athenian imperialism falls short of a theory of human dignity, nevertheless continue the epic tradition of asking where the human and ethical community begins and ends. Following Thucydides's analysis of such events as plague and civil strife, it is clear that the good treatment of everyone within and outside of particular local communities is an ideal to be guarded jealously. Human dignity, in practice, is clearly a virtue that can easily slip away, or as Thucydides puts it of war, plague, and civil strife, human nature, being what it is, these things will happen again.

# Chapter 2: Dignity in Roman and Stoic Thought
*Miriam Griffin*

In his recent book *Dignity*, Michael Rosen writes: "To untangle the idea of dignity, the best way, I think, is to reach back to its roots, and these—like all concepts of significant interest in political life—are historical."1 But how historically deep are these roots? Given the obvious etymological connection of "dignity" with the Latin term *dignitas*, it seems sensible to ask if this Roman notion, which was originally based on merit, was somehow expanded by Roman writers to yield something like our contemporary notion of an unearned, distinctive, inalienable human value. Some Roman writers—those influenced by the tradition of Stoicism, like Cicero—already enjoy something of a reputation for exactly this. It thus makes sense to examine their views. We might also pursue a related witness to dignity—rights, given that the contemporary notion of human dignity is frequently used as a basis for the idea of human rights.

## Difficulties with the Enquiry

Three lexical problems confront us from the start. First, *dignitas* was a word that possessed many possible strands of meaning. As Rosen points out, we still make use of many of these strands.2 Here, however, our focus is on the contribution made by one possible strand to one important modern notion. We are searching for the roots of the idea of human dignity in the sense of a universal and inalienable property of human beings, which can serve as the foundation of basic human rights. We may find it, just as some prominent scholars like Martha Nussbaum have suggested. But, as will emerge, it is clearly not the central ancient meaning, or even a particularly common one. Which is to say, if it *is* there, no easy and straightforward lexical analysis will suffice.

Second, the reputed Stoic concept of dignity that those like Nussbaum highlight, and which figures in later Roman discussions of *dignitas*, opens up the question about vocabulary, both in Greek, the original language of Stoicism, and also in Latin. There is no Greek word that translates *dignitas* specifically. *Axiōma*—sometimes suggested as a candidate—is also the word used for *auctoritas* (the quality that gives one authority and influence). Nor is *axiōma* an important term in Stoic ethics, though it is one in logic, where it means "judgment" or "proposition." Therefore, we cannot expect to find the concept of dignity under that term (*axiōma*) in our Greek Stoic sources. We may well assume, however, that Panaetius, a Stoic philosopher of the Roman period and Cicero's Greek "source" for *On Duties*, had a word for the concept, unless all the passages in which *dignitas* occurs in that work were additions by Cicero (which is possible, of course). Possibly Panaetius used *timē* (usually translated as "honor"), since Aristotle, an author Panaetius admired, uses that term in the *Nicomachean Ethics* as the end of the life in politics, saying that it appears to depend on those

<sup>2</sup> Rosen, *Dignity*, 163.

who confer it and that men seek to be honored by men of practical wisdom on the ground of their virtue (1.5.1095b23–30). As we shall see, the notion of outside approval and of approval that is deserved both belong to the Latin *dignitas.*

Finally, the fullest source for the Roman sense of *dignitas* is, in fact, Cicero, who was particularly interested in philosophy. However, it is also a fact that we cannot tell how far his influence in this respect extended. Indeed, what evidence we have suggests his interest in the moral sense of *dignitas* was, and remained, unusual. Of course, given that the eighteenth-century thinker Immanuel Kant is often taken to be the main architect of the modern meaning of dignity, and he was particularly influenced by *On Duties*, as has also been argued by Nussbaum and others, then perhaps the unusualness of Cicero's formulation is of concern only to historians.

Given these lexical difficulties (especially the first two), it is clear that we must extend our enquiry beyond the word *dignitas* to related concepts. But this carries the great danger of taking isolated statements out of context and stretching the ideas in an untypical direction from that in which we want them to go. This problem will surface often in the following discussion, but here I shall give one striking example. Stoics and Roman moralists think in terms of *officia*, obligations or duties or functions that our nature, properly understood, imposes on us, and whose fulfillment will lead to flourishing, or the *vita beata* ("happy life"). The entitlements and rights of those at the receiving end of our actions are far less prominent in their thinking than the obligations of the doers, and even the obligations of the recipients. So, in our enquiry, we are swimming against the current.

## The Different Nuances of *Dignitas*

Let us start with the primary sense of the term *dignitas*, particularly as it took shape in the late Republic, which is the period for which we have most literary evidence.

*Dignitas* is an attribute signifying a certain standing or rank in the community; it rests on a particular office or status, and on the prestige that accrues to its holder. It includes the idea of worthiness and the respect inspired by that worthiness. It is long term, and it is inheritable by descendants. But it is neither inalienable nor unmerited.

It is an outward-looking quality, in that it depends on the view taken of one by others, and it also comprises outward or perceivable behavior. As Seneca was to say, (*Tranq. an*. 1.3), *dignitas* is one of the virtues "that work to make an impression" and "depend on the judgement of others" (*quae in speciem laborant; quidquid ad alienum suffragium venit*). It is, probably, etymologically connected with *decus*, comely and fitting appearance.3

*Dignitas* is inherently comparative. Thus, the individual or collective to which it attaches is understood to be superior to other individuals or collectives. The *dignitas* of a *gens* implies that family's superiority over other families. The *dignitas* of the senate implies the senate's superiority over other orders, such as the equestrian order. The *dignitas* of the equestrian order implies its superiority over the rest of the citizenry. The *dignitas* of the Roman people implies its superiority over other peoples. When *human* dignity as such is mentioned, it is in comparison to animals and to the other elements of creation. But it is not only human beings who can possess *dignitas*. Vines can; houses can; dogs can; and the virtues themselves possess it (*Tusc. Disp.* 5.85; *Fin.* 2.51).

This Roman sense of *dignitas,* merited, outward looking, and comparative, fitted admirably with the political character of the late Republic, which was held, in the Optimate tradition to which Cicero subscribed, to combine equality before the law with grades of *dignitas* (*gradus dignitatis*). As Cicero says (*Rep.* 1.69, 2.40): no one was

<sup>3</sup> Robert Kaster, *Emotion, Restraint, and Community in Ancient Rome* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005).

deprived of suffrage, but the majority of votes was in the hands of those to whom the welfare of the state was most important. The mixed constitution was based on distributive justice, using geometrical proportion, unlike democracy, which used arithmetical proportion (1.43, 1.53).4 The tradition about grades of *dignitas* survived the Republic: it turns up in a letter of Pliny to a provincial governor, written a century and a half after Cicero's *De Re Publica*, where Pliny urges the governor, in his administration of justice, to go on preserving the distinctions of rank and *dignitas*; "Once these are thrown into confusion and destroyed," he writes, "nothing is more unequal than the resultant 'equality'" *Ep.* 9.5). To look ahead for a minute, this conception of *dignitas* also fits with the Stoic conception of justice, taken over from Aristotle's distributive justice, that is, a disposition to distribute things *kat'axian*, or "according to the recipients'" worth (*SVF* 3.267, *hexis aponemētikē tou kat'axian hekastōi*). Cicero in fact renders this Stoic definition of justice as *habitus animi* … *suam cuique tribuens dignitatem* (*Inv.* 2.160, cf. *Off.* 1.42).

If we want to see this Roman political sense of *dignitas* in the raw, however, we can turn to other Romans more representative than Cicero. Caesar urges his troops, while waiting at Ravenna, before crossing the Rubicon,

to defend from his enemies the reputation and *dignity* of the commander under whose leadership they have conducted the state's business with unfailing good fortune for nine years, fought many successful battles, and pacified the whole of Gaul and Germany. (*BC* 1.7)

And Pompey, in negotiating with him, tells him that he should lay aside his anger "for the sake of the commonwealth" in keeping with his

<sup>4</sup> Valentina Arena, *Libertas* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2012), 80–116.

*dignitas* (*pro sua dignitate*) (1.8.3). Catiline, according to Sallust, writes a letter to a man of similarly high birth,

Maddened by wrongs and insults, since I was robbed of the fruits of my toil and industry and was unable to attain to a position of *dignitas*, … because I saw the unworthy elevated to honors, … in order to preserve what *dignitas* I have left, I have adopted measures honorable enough for my situation. (*Bellum Catilinae* 35)5

The emphasis for all three ambitious Romans is on personal achievement and the reputation and standing acquired by it.

But Cicero, too, could stand on his *dignitas*, and his political ideal of *otium cum dignitate* combined domestic tranquility, that is, the maintenance of the established form of republican government, with the worthy standing (*dignitas*) of the best people (*Pro Sestio* 98). Cicero spells out the strands of the term *dignitas* in a famous letter written during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. It is addressed to Cn. Plancius, a Pompeian in exile, during Caesar's Spanish campaign of 45, which was to end in his final victory (*Fam*. 4.14.1). Plancius had congratulated Cicero on maintaining his former *dignitas*:

Well, if *dignitas* means to feel loyal to the commonwealth and to have one's sentiments approved by good men, then I do maintain my *dignitas*. But if it consists in the power to translate those loyal feelings into action, or even to speak freely in their defense, not a vestige of *dignitas* is left to us.

*Dignitas* for Cicero should incorporate *auctoritas*, the ability to use one's authority and influence to get things done; as he says in *De Inventione*

<sup>5</sup> Note also an inscription, *ILS* 7298, probably of the early third century ad, commemorating a woman called Cominia Vipsania Dignitas who, appropriately, is called *clarissima femina* (abbreviated as *c.f.*).

2.166, "*Dignitas* is honourable *auctoritas*, deserving of respect, honor, and reverence."6 This he, and his peers, had lost under Caesar's dictatorship. But the loyal sentiments about the commonwealth that Pompey had urged on Caesar, Cicero still had, as well as the approval of men.

Though, when speaking to Plancius, Cicero concentrates on patriotism, which often seems, for an aristocratic Roman, to be the supreme moral good, something broader seems to be involved in Cicero's famous comment to Atticus (*Att*. 7.11.1) about Caesar's invasion of Italy: "And he says he is doing all this for the sake of his *dignitas.* Where is *dignitas* except where there is *honestas*?" *Honestas* here is clearly "moral good," since it was glossed, in the sentence above, as Good (*to kalon*). Cicero in fact accuses Caesar here of crimes (*scelera*), albeit political crimes. But the link of *dignitas* with morality is not confined to Cicero. The younger Scipio, in the second century bc, is credited with saying, "From innocence arises dignity; from dignity honor" (*ex innocentia nascitur dignitas, ex dignitate honor*) (Malcovati, *ORF*, p. 241, no. 22),7 and Caesar's associate Cornelius Balbus links *dignitas* with *fides* (good faith), in urging Cicero to remain neutral in the civil war between Caesar and Pompey (*Att.* 9.7A). Nonetheless, Cicero probably gives the term more of a moral and philosophical tinge than most of his political friends would have allowed it.8 Thus, in the oratorical treatise *On the Classification of Rhetoric* (*De Partitione Oratoria*), addressed to his son, he says, of persons who are humane and cultivated, that they put *dignitas* above utility, which involves giving first place to "praise, honor, glory good faith, justice, and all the forms of virtue" (90). And in his philosophical works he is very prone to ascribe *dignitas* to virtue in general (*Tusc. Disp.* 5.85), to the *honestum* (*Fin.* 3.21), as well as to particular virtues (*Fin.* 2.51), and Seneca follows him (*Ben.* 4.16.3). This is an allusion

<sup>6</sup> On the relation of *auctoritas* to *dignitas*, see Jean Hellegouarc'h, *Vocabulaire latin des relations et des partis politiques sous la république* (Paris: les Belles lettres, 1972), 403, 406 n. 1, 408.

<sup>7</sup> The quotation goes on: *ex honore imperium, ex imperio libertas*, which links the moral grounding of *dignitas* to its outcome in freedom of action, as Cicero's letter does.

<sup>8</sup> Hellegouarc'h, *Vocabulaire latin,* 409.

to the etymological connection of *dignitas* with *decus* and goes with the Stoic idea of *to prepon* or, in Latin, *decorum*, the essence of which is that what is seemly is honorable, and what is honorable is seemly (*Off.* 1.93; cf. *Fin.*2.47). Seneca spells out the visual attraction of virtue and ascribes it to Providence: "Of all the benefits that we have from Nature this is the greatest: the fact that Virtue causes her light to penetrate into the minds of all; even those who do not follow her, see her" (*Ben.* 4.17.4).

## *Dignitas* with Philosophical Overtones

This brings us to *dignitas* as it features in Roman philosophy of Stoic inspiration. Cicero wrote about Stoic ethics systematically in two works: *On Ends* (*De finibus*) and *On Duties* (*De officiis*). In these works, he uses the term *dignitas* in the senses we have outlined, but in *On Duties* he also associates the term with the dignity of human beings *in general*, which rests on their superiority to other creatures. As Cancik observed, this is the first appearance we have of the formula "the dignity of man."9 It occurs in two contexts:

- 1. Discussion of the duties that follow from the specific virtue that Cicero likes to call *decorum* or seemliness, that is, the fourth of the cardinal virtues, usually called temperance or moderation.
- 2. Discussion of how to practice liberality, which falls under the virtue of justice.

## *Duties of Decorum*

In *On Duties*, after a very complex discussion of *decorum* as a characteristic inseparable from virtue in general (as we saw previously) and

<sup>9</sup> H. Cancik, "'Dignity of Man' and 'Persona' in Stoic Anthropology: Some Remarks on Cicero, *De Officiis* I 105–107," in *The Concept of Human Dignity in Human Rights Discourse*, ed. D. Kretzmer, and E. Klein (The Hague: Kluwer Law International, 1972), 19–40, esp. 21, 24, 27.

of *decorum* as the fourth virtue of moderation and restraint, Cicero turns to the duties or obligations that arise from this specific *decorum.* Prominent in this discussion is the doctrine of the four *personae*, the word *persona* (meaning "role") being borrowed from the world of drama and rhetoric, where characters need to be assigned words and deeds appropriate to their role. So the four *personae* determine our duties, of which the first two concern us here. Nature imposes on us, first, a role consonant with universal human nature, which has made us possessors of reason and thus superior to other creatures (1.97, 1.107). The second *persona* we are given is that of our individual natures, our temperament and talents. Cicero cautions, "For we must act in such a way that we attempt nothing contrary to universal nature, that is, the first *persona*; but, while conserving that, let us follow our own nature" (1.110).

In discussing the superiority of human beings, the first *decorum*, Cicero is keen to emphasize that this is a status we must live up to. "If we wish to reflect on the excellence and *dignitas* in our nature, we shall realize how dishonorable it is to sink into luxury and live a soft and effeminate lifestyle, but how honorable it is to live thriftily and strictly, with self-restraint, severely and soberly" (1.106). So we should give our bodies the care needed for health, not for pleasure, which is what mere instinct leads animals to pursue. If a person is too susceptible to pleasure, he will conceal his inclination, because of a sense of shame—that is, provided he is not actually one of the beasts, "for," Cicero says, "some are men, not in fact, but in name only" (1.105). Human beings then do not have an *automatic* and *inalienable* dignity. Nature gives them a role to play, and they must strive to play that role.

Let us now spread the net wider, to include discussions where the actual word *dignitas* does not feature, but which are important for this Stoic notion of humanity. Before returning to Cicero, it is illuminating to look at the letter of Seneca (*Ep.* 41) in which, according to Nussbaum,10 he is eloquent in his description of the beauty of the

<sup>10</sup> Martha Nussbaum, "Kant and Stoic Cosmopolitanism," *Journal of Political Philosophy* 5 (1997): 8.

moral substance of humanity in each person, and of the attitudes of quasi-religious awe with which he is inspired by his contemplation of a human being's rational and moral purpose. Nussbaum omits to mention that Seneca is describing, not any ordinary man, but the sage. He points out that, just as we are sensible of the presence of the deity in unusually tall trees, in mighty rivers, and in exceptionally deep pools, so "If you see a man who is unterrified in the midst of dangers, untouched by desires, happy in adversity, peaceful amid the storm, who looks down upon men from a higher plane, and views the gods on a footing of equality, will not a feeling of reverence for him steal over you?" "When a soul rises superior to other souls, when it is under control, when it passes through every experience as if it were of small account, when it smiles at our fears and at our prayers, it is stirred by a force from heaven" (par. 4). Toward the close of the letter (pars. 8–9), Seneca says, "For a human being is a reasoning animal. Therefore, a human being's highest good is attained if he has fulfilled the good for which nature designed him at birth. And what is it that this reason demands of him? The easiest thing in the world—to live in accordance with his own nature. But this is turned into a hard task by the general madness of humankind: we push each other into vice."

Nussbaum suggests that this letter influenced Kant. In that case, it must be a passage like the page in the *Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals* (*Ak.* 4.439–40) that, according to Rosen,11 contains a minor aspect of Kant's use of the term "dignity": here, "Rather than dignity being an intrinsic quality of all human beings in so far as they carry the moral law within themselves, it is a feature of those who follow the moral law's command." This is the dignity of the person "who fulfils all his duties."12

<sup>11</sup> Rosen, *Dignity*, 29.

<sup>12</sup> In fact, in the passage Cancik, "Dignity of Man," 34, cites from *Über Pädagogik*, Kant speaks of the duty of the individual human not to *verleugnen* (belie or violate) the dignity of humankind (*Würde der Menschheit*) that is in him, by acting like an animal—a clear allusion to the passage of Cicero in which the formula "dignity of man" is first found.

The superiority of human nature does, however, result, for the Stoics, in a social bond involving all men. For reason is shared only by gods and human beings, and it is a bond between them. Since right reason is law and those who share law share justice, they are members of the same *civitas* (*On the Laws* 1.22). More exactly, we are citizens of the universe *quasi unius Urbis* ("as it were, of a single city)" (*On the Laws* 1.61; *On Ends* 3.64). This is a metaphysical community comprising all rational beings, gods as well as humans, meaning all human beings, whether or not they are virtuous.13 The emphasis in the Roman Stoics is on the bond between humans (e.g., *Off.* 1.100, 3.27–28)—though the bond is sanctioned by the gods (Marcus 10.36.2; Sen. *Ep.* 95.52–54), because that is where practical obligations arise. As Cicero puts it in *On Duties* 3.27, "If nature prescribes that a human being should be concerned for a human being, *whoever he may be*, for the very reason that he is a human being, it is necessary, according to the same nature, that what is beneficial to all is something common" (emphasis added). In the same work, Cicero adopts as a *formula* or rule of procedure, against which every act must be measured, "For one person to take something from another, and to increase one's own advantage at the cost of another's disadvantage, is more contrary to nature than death, than poverty, than pain, than anything else that may happen to his body or to his external possessions" (3.21, cf. 3.27). "This principle is the tightest bond of the fellowship of the human race" (3.28).

Rosemary Wright and Richard Sorabji have suggested that Cicero's emphasis, both in *On Ends* and here, is closer to modern conceptions of human rights than most Stoic texts.14 As Sorabji says, the emphasis is on the recipient, not just on the material for the agent's exercise of virtue; hence "a little more like an end in itself," in that a right imposes

<sup>13</sup> Peter A. Brunt, *Studies in Stoicism* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), 29.

<sup>14</sup> M. Rosemary Wright, *On Stoic Good and Evil: "De Finibus 3" and "Paradoxa Stoicorum"* (Warminster: Aris & Phillips, 1991), 175–76; Richard Sorabji, *Animal Mind and Human Morals* (London: Duckworth, 1993), 45.

a duty on agents because of something about the recipients. But he rightly urges caution, because the Stoics still devalued material things, regarding them merely as "indifferents" (some positive, some negative, and some purely indifferent), so that our main duty to other human beings, according to Cicero, seems to be teaching them morality (*Fin.* 3.65; *Leg.* 1.33). In fact Seneca, while emphasizing that one can serve humankind either as a citizen of one's own state or as a citizen of the world state, says that the latter service consists mostly in philosophical contemplation (*Otio* 4, 6.4.5). Moreover, the Stoics thought that Providence has already ensured a benign condition of humankind, so that great strides in social improvement are not to be sought. A key example of this is that, although the Stoa did not think there were slaves by nature (*SVF* 3.352), slavery being a condition imposed by fortune (*Off.* 1.41), they did not go beyond preaching good treatment for slaves. By contrast a UN resolution of 1986 prescribed that instruments of human rights should not only "derive from the inherent dignity and worth of the human person" but "provide realistic and effective implementation machinery."

There are other ideas connected with the Stoic notion of the social bond that are relevant to our enquiry. Humans have a "social instinct," the Stoics claimed, which has been implanted by providential nature, in order to compensate for humankind's relative weakness and its lack of protective covering or natural weapons, like claws or horns. The mechanism by which nature has instilled the social instinct is *oikeiōsis*, usually translated as "appropriation." This is making one's own, or coming to treat as belonging to oneself, a widening circle of people, starting with one's own person, extending first to one's offspring and relatives, then to the members of one's community, then to one's fellow countrymen, and finally to the whole human race, so that the mere fact of their common humanity means that no person feels alien to another (*Fin.* 3.63). Cicero and Seneca like to allude to the famous line of the comic poet Terence, "I am a man and think nothing human alien to me" (*homo sum, humani nil a me alienum* 

*puto: Heautontimorumenos*, 77). Hierocles circa 100 ad (L-S 57 G) set this out as a system of concentric circles, enjoining us to draw the circles further and further toward the center. The idea is to reduce the sense of distance in all our relationships with other people, and to reflect this in our behavior toward each other. However, these other relationships are still there and are still important. Thus Cicero in *On Duties* 1.160 says, of the obligations that fall under the "social virtue" (as he calls "justice"), that it is not difficult to see which should take precedence over another. First, duties are owed to the gods, then to our country, then to our parents and "down the scale to the others."15 No reference is made in any of these lists (see also 1.53) to humankind as a whole. But in *On Ends* 5.65, spoken by the representative of Antiochus's Old Academy (whose ethical views are close to Stoicism), not only are friendships and neighbors inserted between relations and *cives*, but the list extends beyond fellow citizens, first to allies and friends of our city, and finally to the whole sweep of the human race (*totius gentis humanae complexus*), just as it does in Hierocles's circles. Justice is said both to give each his own and to maintain that human solidarity and alliance with generosity and equity.

*On Duties* is a work that gives priority to obligations to the *res publica*, so nothing is allowed to trump that. But, even in this passage in *On Ends*, the allusions to giving each his own make it clear that our obligations to these groups are proportional, not equivalent (cf. below on *Off.* 1.42). In *On Duties* Cicero will explicitly say, "The fellowship between human beings and their common bonding will best be preserved if, the closer someone is to you, the more kindness (*benignitas*) you confer on him" (1.50).16 In *On Ends* 3.64 Cicero is a bit more generous: he goes so far as to make Cato, the Stoic spokesman, say that the

<sup>15</sup> At 1.58 he omits the gods, because he is speaking of providing material necessities, and Cicero gives priority to our country, then our parents, next our children and our household, then other relations. 
<sup>16</sup> This follows the definition of justice, as Cicero gives it in *On Invention* 2.161: *habitus animi communi utilitate conservata suam cuique tribuens dignitatem*. In Marcus Aurelius 3.11 we find the combination of the idea of treating someone justly and kindly in accordance with the natural law of companionship with the notion of giving the person what is deserved or appropriate (*kat'axian*) out of the material things that are positive indifferents (though not goods). See Christopher Gill, *Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations", Books 1–6* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), xl–xlvi.

traitor to his country does not deserve *greater* reprobation than the man who betrays the common advantage or security for the sake of his own advantage and security.

## *How to Practice Liberality*

The ranking of obligations in *On Duties* concerns justice, and all the lists, except the one mentioning the gods, occur in Cicero's discussion of beneficence, a subcategory of justice. This brings us to the second context in which human dignity is mentioned. At the start of his discussion of beneficence, the term *dignitas* occurs in the advice that kindness (*benignitas*) should be bestowed upon each person according to his *dignitas*, for that is fundamental to justice, to which all these matters should be referred (*Off.* 1.42).17 Cicero spells out what choosing "according to standing" means here (1.45): we should consider the character of the person on whom the benefit is conferred, looking for indications of virtue but not imposing too high a standard (1.45–46); the person's attitude toward us, looking for affection that goes with reliable goodwill (1.47); and, finally, the person's past services to us and the degree of fellowship with us (1.47–50). This is not a matter of *dignitas* in the sense of rank or social standing, but it clearly relates to merit and worth in a particular relationship, not to any quality that all men have in common. Cicero does say that we should help the poor, but only "other things being equal" (1.49: *si cetera paria sunt*). In other words, having screened possible recipients for *dignitas* in the sense just described, we choose the poorest of those who qualify.

<sup>17</sup> Dyck ad loc. seems surprised at this comment, but it follows the standard definition of justice. Andrew R. Dyck, *A Commentary on Cicero, "De Officiis"* (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1996).

Cicero does, however, think that we have some obligations to members of the fellowship of the entire human race (1.50: *universi generis humani societas*), not only the negative one of the *formula*—not to harm another human being for our own advantage—but also positive obligations to show people the way if they are lost, and to provide them with fire and water. Cicero's conception of these obligations is very restricted though. Quoting the poet Ennius:

A man who kindly shows the path to someone who is lost lights another's light, so to speak, from his own.

For his own shines no less because he has lit another's. (313–15 Jocelyn)

Cicero puts great emphasis on the last line, saying of the poet, "With this one instance, he advises us that if any assistance can be provided without detriment to oneself, it should be given even to a stranger" (1.51). The limitation "without detriment to oneself " is justified on the ground that the resources of individuals are small, but the mass of those in need is infinitely great. If we accept the limitation on general liberality, we shall still be able to be liberal to those close to us (1.52).

Cicero even accepts that there can be exceptions to applying the *formula* about not serving one's own advantage by disadvantaging another human being. If a good person is dying of cold, can he steal clothes from a monstrous tyrant? The answer is yes, because tyrants have put themselves outside the bonds of human fellowship, so it is honorable to rob him, and indeed to kill him (3.32). (Cicero was writing in the shadow of Caesar's assassination, which is never far from his thoughts in *On Duties*.) Even more telling is his answer to the question, "If a sage is dying of hunger can he steal food from another person, if he is a useless person?" The answer here is more complex: if the sage steals the food for his own benefit out of self-love, then he will have acted inhumanly and against the law of nature, but if he takes the food for the reason that he is the kind of person to bring great benefit to the fellowship of mankind if he remained alive, that is not a matter for rebuke (3.30–31).

Seneca too is keen to emphasize discrimination in giving benefits. In his treatise of that name, he emphasizes that we should choose as recipients those who will respond with gratitude (*Ben.* 1.10.5). But we should do something for those who we think will be, or even know have been, ungrateful. "For example, if I shall be able to restore to someone his sons by rescuing them from danger without any risk to myself, I shall not hesitate to do so." Seneca goes on to say that he will defend a deserving person (*dignum*), even at the cost of his life, but even an undeserving person he will rescue from robbers by uttering a cry (clearly at no risk to himself ), in order to save a human being.

Later on in *On Benefits*, he returns to the question of ungrateful recipients (4.29). Here he is asked if we will not give an ungrateful person advice when he is perplexed, nor a drink of water, nor show him the way when he is lost. Seneca now makes it clear that these minimal services and others, like tossing a person a coin or giving him a light, are not *benefits*, however useful they may be at the time, because they are too trivial and because they are bestowed carelessly, not with the thought that the recipients are worthy. "We are giving," he concludes, "not to a human being, but to humanity" (*non homini damus, sed humanitati*).

We recognize here the minimal services that Cicero had mentioned. They occur again in Seneca's *Letter* 95.51–52, where the general argument is that honorable conduct and the happy life cannot be achieved by precepts alone: we need to know the underlying doctrines, in order to interpret the precepts properly and know how to apply them. So, in dealing with other human beings, precepts can tell us to refrain from bloodshed, or to help a shipwrecked sailor, or to point out the way to a wanderer, or to share a crust with the starving, but they do not cover

everything that we should give or withhold. Instead, Seneca produces his own *formula* for our duty:

All that you behold, that which comprises the divine and the human, is one; we are the parts of one great body. Nature produced us related to each other, since she created us from the same source and to the same end. She engendered in us mutual affection and made us sociable. She established fairness and justice; according to her ruling it is more wretched to commit than to suffer injury. Through her orders, let our hands be ready for all that need to be helped.

He then quotes the famous lines of Terence and ends, "Let us possess things in common; for birth is ours in common." We can compare this to Cicero's "One should treat common goods as common and private goods as one's own" (*Off.* 1.20), and if, in the prohibition on doing injury, we recognize Cicero's *formula*, we also register in Seneca's *formula* that Seneca wants us to go further, and to be ready to give help wherever it is needed.

Again, here we may seem close to the idea of recipients receiving things by right of being human, but we need to consider what response Seneca's recipients are expected to give. Seneca thinks that some form of gratitude is expected, even when one is in receipt of communal benefits, where one is not chosen as an individual recipient, but only not excluded as a member of a group (*Ben.* 6.18–19). However, if a benefit is directed at one person and incidentally works to the advantage of someone else, only the former owes gratitude. Thus if one saves a son's life, the benefit was given to the son, though the father may be so delighted that he wishes to give something—not because he is under an obligation to do so, not as an act of gratitude, but because he wants to confer a benefit himself as an act of justice (i.e., giving to a worthy person).

In 5.20.4–6 Seneca deals with the difficult question of burying the corpse of an unknown person, whom one does not recognize. Clearly, this cannot be a benefit to the corpse, who will be unaware of the act. It can be a benefit to his son, but only if the person burying the corpse recognized it as the son's father and intended to render a service to the son by performing for him a customary and necessary duty. Otherwise, the act is done out of pity and humanity, sentiments that could lead the person to hide away anyone's dead body.18 There is no one indebted for his doing what he did—he was being *humanus in publicum*, "humane" or "in the public interest."

Does this act of humanity, falling outside the exchange of benefit and gratitude, imply a right? It seems to me closer to *that* notion than to Michael Rosen's idea that burying an anonymous corpse is a duty expressive of respect for humanity, and, since we also are human, "fundamentally a duty towards ourselves."19

Then again, there are perhaps traces of the idea of rights when *dignitas* is coupled with verbs like *postulare* (to demand or claim). So Cicero will say to his patrician friend Manlius Torquatus, who asks about his own chances of pardon in 45 (*Fam.* 6.1.2), that Caesar has up to now been more unjust than your *dignitas* demanded, or as Shackleton-Bailey translates it, "than your personal eminence made incumbent." Again, Cicero says of a friend he has recommended, "I am not surprised that you value our friend Furnius as highly as his own *humanitas* and *dignitas* demand," translated by Shackleton-Bailey with "as highly as his own goodness and high standing deserve" (*Fam*. 10.1.4 in 44 bc to Plancus). But these cases, we observe, even if they approach the idea of "rights," attach it to the primary Roman meaning of *dignitas* as social standing, not the worth of a human being per se.

<sup>18</sup> It is important to remember that pity is not a good motive for a Stoic (see Seneca's *De Clemetia I*). So the social instinct does not lead us to have this feeling. We help fellow humans out of virtue that includes concern for the communal welfare.

<sup>19</sup> Rosen, *Dignity*, 140, 128, 157.

I close with a passage in Cicero's speech in defense of Murena (1.2), where he speaks of the *dignitas* of the *res publica* and what it demands. Speaking of the traditional election prayer that the consuls make for the good fortune of the successful candidates, their successors, Cicero suggests that the prayer "contains as much force and religious power as the *dignity of the commonwealth demands*" (emphasis added). I suspect that, for the Romans, the *res publica*, with its *dignitas*, came nearer to having rights than any single human being.

# *Reflection*: Dignity in Confucian and Buddhist Thought 
*David B. Wong*

The concept of dignity in the western tradition may be understood as the concept of inherent and unearned worth that entitles each person respectful attitudes and treatment. Classical Confucian and Buddhist thought contain concepts that overlap in meaning with this concept, making possible a three-way dialogue. The parties discuss dignity in sufficiently different ways to make their dialogue challenging to all concerned.

Mencius (fourth century bce) arguably employs the clearest indication of something like a moral concept of dignity in Confucianism. In 6A10 Mencius asserts that a wayfarer will reject even at the risk of death a basketful of rice and a bowlful of soup when offered contemptuously. A beggar will not demean himself by taking them if they have been trampled upon. In each case, the man is plausibly construed as defending his dignity. Mencius holds that such reactions emerge from inborn dispositions he calls *duan* (beginnings or sprouts).1 These are inborn dispositions to think and feel in response to certain kinds of events. If nurtured

<sup>1</sup> Mencius seems to have originated the idea of moral sprouts in human nature.

appropriately, the *duan* will make one an exemplary person, a *junzi.* The term originally had an aristocratic meaning—"son of a prince"—but later evolved with considerable influence to mean a kind of moral nobility that could be achieved by a person from any background. There are hints, but only hints, of this change in the *Zhou yi* (a divination text that contains references as early as the eleventh century bce and that was later incorporated into the *I Ching*, or Book of Changes). A more clearly moral meaning emerges in the *Shijing*, or *Book of Poetry* (with material dating from the seventh century to eleventh century bce), and the change comes to fruition in the *Lunyu* or *Analects* of Confucius (551–479 bce). The development of the Confucian concept of dignity, then, parallels the development of the western tradition from basing dignity on social rank to something that everyone has.

A person's disposition to reject demeaning treatment belongs to the *duan* that feels shame and dislike. One could dislike and regard as shameful something that one could do or has done or what others could do or have done. To accept demeaning treatment would be shameful, but to treat others in a demeaning way would also be shameful. One's responsibility to treat others as having worth is often put as the responsibility to *jing* others. In the Confucian literature, especially the texts of Mencius and Xunzi (fourth–third century bce), to *jing* others is to respect them as having worth, in virtue of which they are due careful regard or attention (indeed, one of the related and primary meanings of *jing* is seriousness;2 see Chan 2006). Among those mentioned as appropriate objects of *jing* are one's parents (*Analects* 4.18), one's master (*Mencius* 4B31), one's elders (6A5), and the virtuous (*Xunzi* 51/13/40). However, there are mentions of *jing*-ing everyone (*Mencius* 4B28; *Xunzi* 16/6/31).

<sup>2 <</sup>i>Jing as seriousness seems to predominate in the *Analects*, while in Mencius and Xunzi, *jing* turns more toward the meaning of an attitude one can take toward persons and other things that have worth.

This disposition is the beginning of the virtue of *yi*, which is most often translated as "righteousness," and should be understood as the virtue of being able to identify and act according to what is right and wrong.3 The other beginnings are the feeling of *bu ren ren zhi xin*, "not being able to bear the suffering of others" (most often translated as "compassion"), which can grow into the virtue of *ren* (translated variously as "humanity," "benevolence," and "humanheartedness"), which involves attitudes and conduct that express care for and love of others), the feeling of deference for others such as one's parents and elders, which grows into *li* (observing ritual propriety in ceremonies such as weddings and funerals and daily social rituals such as greeting others and the appropriate way of taking meals with them), and the feeling of approval/disapproval, which grows into *zhi* (wisdom, which includes the ability to identify the appropriate means to the appropriate ends in the various realms of life, including governing and advising rulers).

It is crucial to understanding Mencius that the sprouts be recognized *only* as the beginnings of virtue. They require nurturing through education, through the provision of opportunity for secure livelihood that will spare people the physical and psychic resources to develop their beginnings, and through the personal effort of each person to develop his or her beginnings. In Confucianism, that which confers dignity on the individual also confers responsibility on that same person to develop it. As indicated above, Mencius holds that a secure material livelihood and ethical education are conditions for moral development. In 1A7, he clearly holds King Xuan responsible for realizing these conditions for his people,

<sup>3</sup> The similarity between this feature of Mencius's theory and modern moral sense theory as developed by Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, Hume, and Smith has not escaped some scholars. See, e.g., Alejandra Mancilla, "The Bridge of Benevolence: Hutcheson and Mencius," *Dao* 12 (2013): 57–72; David Morrow, "Moral Psychology and the 'Mencian Creature,'" *Philosophical Psychology* 22 (2009): 281– 304; and Bongrae Seok, *Embodied Moral Psychology and Confucian Moral Philosophy* (Lanham, MD: Lexington Books, 2012).

and if he does not, Mencius says, there will be no dissoluteness, depravity, deviance, or excess to which people will not succumb (see also 6A7). Moreover, to punish them for crimes committed under these conditions is to entrap them.

The idea that the qualities conferring dignity also confer responsibility on their possessor to develop them is not highlighted in the western tradition, but it may appear eminently reasonable once one is confronted with it in the Confucian tradition. Furthermore, one cannot only fail to fulfill one's responsibility. One can neglect and abuse the moral sprouts so that they wither and die, and it will be as if they were never there in the first place (6A7–8). Such a person will be reduced to the condition of being on a par with animals and become unworthy of what one was given. Again, this idea does not seem to have been highlighted in the western tradition, but once posed, it can be hard to avoid its force.

But should the proper response to those who have abused their *duan* be the revocation of dignity for offenders, and where is the threshold that justifies such a severe response? There is no direct response to these hard questions in the Confucian tradition, and one reason for this is that the tradition spreads the responsibility to develop one's moral potentials to others. Both the self and others share responsibility to develop one's sprouts, and this is appropriate in a philosophy that emphasizes the relational nature of persons. One only becomes the person one is through the help, or lack of it, of others. Thus, one may deserve a great deal of blame for failing to develop one's moral potentials, but much of the time that blame will be shared with others.

In Buddhism, human beings are not fundamentally different from other sentient beings. In the karmic cycle of birth, death, and rebirth, a human being at one time may become or may have been an animal at another. In virtue of their capability for suffering, all sentient beings should be treated with compassion and loving kindness. What makes human beings special is their capability for

awakening to the way the world is and the conventional reality of their selves. According to the Buddhist doctrine of "no-self " (in Pāli, *anattā*; in Sanskrit, *anātman*), there is no substantial self only a stream of mental-physical phenomena inextricably related to the other streams constituting sentient beings and to nonsentient beings as well. Awakening includes recognizing that one's self is merely conventionally real, that is, existing as an individual only when conceived as such in the way that the parts of a chariot are conceived by human beings as parts of a single thing, given the purposes they have in mind for it. Such an awakening leads to shedding attachment to the self, and most importantly, to be free of the suffering of the self (the *Milindapanha* "Questions of Milinda," question 1, approximately 100 bce; see also sermons of the Buddha, especially verse 7 of the *Dhammapada*, third century bce). One becomes free when one awakens to the conventionality of what makes one a distinct individual as opposed to others, and that makes the suffering of others equally important. That is why, in the Mahayana tradition, the highest ideal is not simply to liberate oneself from suffering and exit the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth to enter Nirvana, but to become a bodhisattva, one who has awakened but elects not to enter into nirvana until all others are released from their suffering (Śāntideva, *Śikṣā-samuccaya* 12, seventh–eighth centuries ce).

Insofar as dignity implies a substantial, nonconventional self or attaching importance to such a self, Buddhism does not support dignity. But insofar as equality and universality are part of the concept of dignity, Buddhism has the concept. A possible basis for a distinctively human kind of dignity lies in the distinctively human capability for awakening. However, this capability involves realizing that one's individuality is not as real or as important as one thought it was, and that this is the key to being free from the suffering that any being, human or animal, should be free from. This is not the basis for the kind of dignity arising from the western tradition.

Confucianism forthrightly asserts the special value of the individual, but that special value lies in one's capacity and responsibility to connect with others and to create a truly human and worthwhile life of relationship. Buddhism also asserts the special value of the individual, but only as a conventional individual, and that value lies in the ability to awaken to the conventionality of selves and the importance of freeing every sentient being from suffering. Those who see the tradition of western thinking about dignity as too closely associated with a fragmenting and hard-edged individualism or with an inflated and unsustainable view of humanity as the center of the universe will do well to look to these other traditions.

# Chapter 3: In the Image of God - Human Dignity after the Fall
*Bonnie Kent*

Christian writings from late antiquity through the Middle Ages have a great deal to say about the biblical account of creation, including the passage declaring that God made humans in his image (Gen. 1:26–27). The literature from the Latin West also has much to say about the dignity (*dignitas*) of various beings and things.1 Many texts discuss the dignity of God or Christ, the angels, Christ's followers, or kings, bishops, priests, and other people with special offices. Other texts discuss the dignity of the soul, various powers of the soul, or different virtues or gifts of the Holy Spirit. On the other hand, very few works expatiate on some dignity that all people have just because we are human, or because humans are created in God's image. Rarely do patristic and medieval authors argue for the species-wide, species-specific human

<sup>1</sup> All translations in this chapter are my own.

dignity we often hear about today, especially in debates about human rights.

Consider, for example, Peter Lombard's *Sentences*, the standard theology textbook for universities from the thirteenth century all the way to the sixteenth. It discusses whether the soul has more dignity when not united to the body, whether the Incarnation diminished God's dignity, and whether God created some angels with more dignity than others, to mention only a few contexts where issues of dignity arise. The *Sentences* says nothing about a dignity that all humans have just because we are human, or because humans are created in the image of God. Medieval commentaries on the *Sentences* usually follow the same pattern, but not because of any special reverence for Peter Lombard's opinions. While most thirteenth-century commentators labored to cover all the problems Peter himself raised, they felt free to argue against his positions. By the early fourteenth century, commentators felt equally free to ignore issues Peter raised and explore issues they themselves considered more important. The dignity of all human beings, qua human, was not among them.

I do not mean to suggest that no patristic or medieval texts focus on the dignity of human beings as such, only that it takes scholars effort to unearth them. The list of works so far produced is quite short. It includes two brief, anonymous texts from the Carolingian era, circulated mainly as a composite treatise; a couple of works by John Scotus Eriugena (d. ca. 877), *De spiritu et anima*, an anonymous treatise believed to date from the twelfth century; and various passages from the writings of Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253). Notable by their absence are works by the bestknown and most influential thinkers of the Latin West.

Thomas Aquinas (d. 1274) is no exception: only on rare occasion does he discuss the dignity of human beings as such. Aquinas's *Summa theologiae* even argues that people can fall away from human dignity by sinning, becoming in a way like mindless animals, so that it can be good to kill them.2 Contemporary readers are often surprised by

<sup>2</sup> This argument is discussed below in the text.

this passage, less because Aquinas supports capital punishment than because of the reasons he gives. The argument leads some to conclude that Leo the Great, a fifth-century pope, gave a more robust account of human dignity than Aquinas produced eight hundred years later. Leo, we are told, taught that all humans have dignity because all are made in the image of God—in contrast to Aquinas, who regarded dignity as "an ethical, not an ontological category."3

It is easy to see why contemporary readers might find Leo's work attractive. Dignity is a recurring theme in his sermons. As we will see, though, the similarities between his views and those of Aquinas far exceed the differences. As Leo thinks that people lose dignity when they commit serious sins, so Aquinas thinks that all humans have a dignity that comes from capacities of the soul lacking in nonhuman animals. Neither argues for the species-wide, species-specific human dignity often discussed today. The dignity Leo celebrates is one he thinks all human beings *can* have, but that only Christians actually have.

Why does the patristic and medieval literature, which has so much to say about the image-of-God passage, have so little to say about human dignity? In this chapter I argue that two factors do much to explain why human dignity gets far less attention than modern readers might expect:

- 1. As most authors interpreted scripture, human beings were not the apex of creation. While they believed that God made humans in his image, they believed that he also made angels, and with even greater dignity. Angels were created immortal, so that, by their very nature, they cannot die. The same is true of the human soul but not of human beings as a whole, body and soul together. Equally important, God gave angels as well
<sup>3</sup> Milton Lewis, "A Brief History of Human Dignity: Idea and Application," in *Perspectives on Human Dignity: A Conversation*, ed. Jeff Malpas and Norelle Lickiss (Dordrecht: Springer, 2007), 94; Carlos Ruiz Miguel, "Human Dignity: History of an Idea," *Jahrbuch des öffentlichen Rechts der Gegenwart* 22 (2002): 285–86.

as humans understanding, will, and free choice. The kind of dignity that comes from having such capacities, then, belongs to all rational creatures, not to humans alone.

- 2. As the creation story came to be understood in the Latin West, it was only the beginning of a narrative of humankind's sin and redemption. The narrative is predicated on the assumption that human nature is mutable. It was so badly deformed by the Fall that it needs to be reformed in the likeness of Christ, the second Adam. So even if humans alone had been made in the image of God, being made in the image of God has less importance than being remade in the likeness of Christ. Christians have a dignity that no other humans do, and they alone can attain eternal happiness; but even Christians must still struggle with lingering effects of the Fall. They must take care not to lose their dignity by committing serious sins.
To understand the basis for these views, we need to consider how patristic and medieval authors interpreted scripture. The account of creation alone raises more exegetical puzzles than a casual reader would notice. Read farther, to the story of the first humans' disobedience and punishment, and the problems quickly multiply. To solve them Christian thinkers looked to other parts of the Bible, including and especially Paul's epistles. How one ought to interpret Paul itself became a topic of controversy.

I will pay particular attention to works by Augustine (d. 430) because the dominant narrative of sin and redemption was largely of his devising. Its popularity in the Latin West during the Middle Ages owes something to the respect that later Christian thinkers had for his teachings, but also something to official church doctrine. Beginning with the condemnations of Pelagian teachings in the early fifth century, anyone who insisted that human nature as it exists now is in the same condition that it was before the Fall could be charged with heresy.

The idea that Adam merely set a bad example for his descendants was firmly rejected.

The dominant narrative grants that even fallen human beings have rational capacities lacking in animals. By nature humans also have a higher end than animals: to know and love God for all eternity, thereby enjoying perfect, everlasting happiness. In these respects human beings never degenerate to the level of beasts. At the same time, the narrative denies that people's rational capacities alone enable them to attain the ultimate end, and it focuses much more on salvation than creation. Ultimately, the only alternative to eternal happiness is eternal suffering in hell, a fate that pigs and chickens need not fear.

Besides rational capacities, what do people need to attain the ultimate end? According to the dominant narrative, we need the grace of baptism to remove the guilt of original sin and make us members of Christ's church. With the possible exception of infants, we also need spiritual dispositions and virtues that make us more Christlike. Although these dispositions and virtues give people the greatest dignity it is possible for humans to have, they can be lost by sinning and restored only through penance and God's grace. Obviously, this is not a narrative that present-day advocates for human rights would find helpful. It places too little weight on creation, too much weight on Christ's sacrifice and God's grace, and thoroughly resists secularization.

Let me issue a couple of caveats before proceeding. First, this chapter focuses on Christian writings from the Latin West. It does not consider works by the Greek Fathers or explore differences between the eastern and western church. Second, this chapter does not take up a good many issues that theologians consider important. I write on the assumption that most readers have a limited tolerance for theology, so that it is best to stay out of the weeds insofar as I possibly can.

## Between Angels and Beasts

For at least the first fourteen hundred years of Christian thought in the West, *dignitas* had the same meanings that it did in Roman literature and philosophy. It did not signify a special kind of worth possessed only by human beings, or even only by living beings. It was an ordinary Latin word with a wide range of meanings, including a purely aesthetic one, so that people spoke of the *dignitas* of speeches, poems, and buildings as well as the *dignitas* of God, angels, and humans. While the word was often used to signify high value or worth, there was nothing incoherent about the claim that everything created by God has *dignitas*, from the angels of heaven all the way down to the lowest earthly things.4 Readers may underestimate just how common *dignitas* is in Latin texts because it often appears in English translations as "worth," "honor," or something other than the cognate "dignity."

The Latin Bible represents a notable exception to the liberal use of *dignitas.* Very seldom is any form of this noun used in the Vulgate.5 It does not appear anywhere in the New Testament, nor does it appear anywhere in the book of Genesis. The account of creation, now often seen as evidence of human dignity, actually says nothing about dignity of any kind. Perhaps this is for the best, because the text raises so many other problems.

One problem is that the creation story says nothing explicit about God's making angels; yet there are over two hundred references to angels in the Bible, some of them even in later chapters of Genesis (Gen. 19:1–15, 48:16). Since God plainly created angels at some point, biblical scholars were left wondering when he created them. On the first day, when he created the heavens? Is the creation of light an

oblique reference to God's creation of the angels? When God says, "Let us make a human being to our image and likeness" (Gen. 1:26), is he speaking to the angels, so that the plural includes them, or is the plural instead a reference to the Trinity?

Regardless of when God made the angels, scriptural passages referring to them suggest that they occupy a higher place than humans in the hierarchy of creation. Angels serve as both the messengers and warriors of God. Sometimes he sends them to guide and protect humans; sometimes he sends them simply to enforce his will, as when he stations angels at the east of Eden to prevent Adam and Eve from returning (Gen. 3:24). Indeed, Psalm 8 expresses wonder that God cares about human beings as much as he does. In the Vulgate it reads:

For I will look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars that you have established; What is a human being, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you visit him?

Yet you have made him a little less than the angels, and you have crowned him with glory and honor. (Ps. 8:4–6)

The author of Hebrews, interpreting "the son of man" as a reference to Christ, concludes that Christ was a little less than the angels during his life as a human being, but is now crowned with glory and honor in heaven (Heb. 2:7–9). According to the gospel of Luke, Christ himself promised his followers that, in the resurrection, they will become "equal to the angels." No longer will they be able to die (Luke 20:36). Notice, though, that Christ's promise does not answer an important question: did humans become inferior to angels only because of Adam's sin, or did God make humans inferior from the outset?

Augustine argues that God gave Adam and Eve immortal souls, so that in this respect they were equal to angels. Their bodies, however, were inferior—not so constituted that they were doomed from the outset to die, but still in need of food and drink to survive. If Adam

and Eve had obeyed God, eventually their bodies would have been transformed into spiritual, immortal bodies. Because they disobeyed, human bodies from then on would inevitably age and die.6 In contrast, God made angels spiritual beings unable to die, so that they have greater natural dignity or worth than even the first humans did. Augustine describes them as having spiritual bodies needing no nourishment and "full of light."7

In book 12 of *City of God* Augustine gives a memorable summary of his position. Although humans were created below angels in the cosmic hierarchy, they were also given free will, so that they could either rise to the level of angels or sink to living like animals:

[God] created the human being's nature as a kind of intermediate between angels and beasts, so that if he submitted to his creator as to his true lord, and kept his commandments with pious obedience, he would pass over into the fellowship of the angels, attaining without an intervening death blessed immortality without end; but if he offended the Lord his God by exercising his free will arrogantly and disobediently, he would live like the beasts, sentenced to death, the slave of his own appetites, and destined after death for eternal punishment.8

Of course, even fallen human nature remains human. When scripture speaks of being sentenced to "live like the beasts," Augustine does not take it to mean that humans become beasts, as they sometimes do in ancient mythology.9 Humans can suffer eternal punishment precisely because we have immortal souls, not the mortal souls that animals do. We also still have capacities of the soul, however damaged, that animals

lack. So even sinful human beings, enslaved to our own desires and destined for hell, have more dignity than animals.

Aquinas agrees that even sinful human beings have more dignity than animals. In his works, though, the differences between angels and humans become greater than they are in Augustine's. Most thirteenth-century theologians share Augustine's view that everything other than God is a composite of matter and form. Aquinas argues, to the contrary, that angels are entirely incorporeal. Like other created things, they are composites of essence and existence, but they are not composites of form and matter. Given Aquinas's conception of matter as the principal of individuation, it follows that there cannot be different angels of the same species. Each one is sui generis.10 Furthermore, angels do not think discursively, as humans do; they immediately grasp truths that the human intellect could grasp only with time and effort. As angels have superior minds, Aquinas argues, so too do they enjoy more perfect freedom than we do.11 Thus he concludes that angels were created more in God's image than humans and have more dignity than humans.12 Even if Adam and Eve had not sinned, they would have remained below angels in the cosmic hierarchy.

The thesis that angels were created more in God's image than humans raises a more basic question: what does it mean to be created in God's image? Since the account of creation in Genesis gives no explanation, answers varied. Even if two thinkers were in complete agreement about how Adam and Eve were originally in God's image, they might still disagree about the consequences of the first humans' disobedience. Does the image of God remain intact in their descendants? Or has it been disfigured, perhaps even entirely lost?

## God's Image, Deformed and Reformed

As biblical scholars commonly point out, Genesis gives two accounts of the creation of Adam and Eve: the first in chapter 1 and the second in chapter 2. The two differ significantly. According to the first account, God created both Adam and Eve in his image. The text says nothing about God's making one before the other or making them from material he had already created (Gen. 1:26–27). According to the second account, Adam is primary and Eve derivative. God made Adam first, from "the slime of the earth," and breathed life into him. Later God decided it was not good for Adam to be alone; so he sent Adam to sleep and proceeded to make Eve from one of Adam's ribs (Gen. 2:7, 18, 21–23). We see here some of the scriptural basis for debates, running from late antiquity all the way to the present, about whether men alone are made in the image of God (*imago Dei*).13

Even considered on its own, the first account of creation provided plenty of fuel for debate. The text reads:

And [God] said: Let us make a human being to our image and likeness: and let him have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts, and the whole earth, and every creeping creature.

And God created the human to his image: to the image of God he created him: male and female he created them. (Gen. 1:26–27)

In book 2 of his *Sentences,* where Peter Lombard (d. 1160) grapples with this passage, he raises what he took to be standard questions about it. Is "likeness" just a synonym for "image," or do these words have different meanings? Is Christ alone truly the image of God? Most important, at least for present purposes, *in which respects* were the first

<sup>13</sup> For a helpful historical survey see Kari Elisabeth Børresen, ed., *The Image of God: Gender Models in Judaeo-Christian Tradition* (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995), esp. 187–235.

human beings created in God's image and likeness?14 Finding different opinions in patristic writings about which features belong to the image and which to the likeness, Peter settles for reciting some of them without saying explicitly which he favors. In book 1 of the *Sentences*, however, he endorsed Augustine's view that the human soul is the image of the Trinity in its capacities for memory, understanding, and will or love. Thus there is reason to think that Peter favors the first opinion he reports about the image-and-likeness passage: namely, that humankind was made in the image and likeness of God "with respect to mind, by which humans exceed nonrational beings"—"in his image, according to memory, understanding, and love; in his likeness according to innocence and righteousness, which exist naturally in the rational mind."15

While the other opinions that Peter reports differ in detail, they reflect two tendencies common in the Latin West: first, to focus on attributes of the mind or rational soul rather than attributes of the human soul as a whole or the human soul and the body together; and second, to include both rational capacities, such as understanding (*intellectus*), and traits considered spiritual dispositions, such as righteousness (*iustitia*). As we know, the focus on attributes of the rational soul reflects the belief that angels too were created in God's image, and possibly even more in God's image than humans; but why is there a mixture of rational capacities and spiritual dispositions?

When contemporary Christians argue that humans are made in God's image, they normally focus on capacities alone, such as the capacity for love or free choice.16 Since the aim is to prove that *all* human beings have dignity, it would be counterproductive to bring in spiritual or moral dispositions that human adults often lack. In contrast, the views Peter Lombard reports are so many different opinions about

human nature in its original form, as God created it in Adam and Eve. Far from assuming that human nature remains unchanged in us, they assume that it has changed for the worse because of the Fall. Although we still have capacities like understanding and will, they do not function as they should, and we have lost the spiritual dispositions God bestowed upon Adam and Eve, such as righteousness or the love of virtue. One of the most disastrous changes is in freedom of choice. Where Adam and Eve had the power to sin or not to sin, we ourselves cannot avoid sinning. Without God's healing grace, we remain enslaved to our own appetites.17 This account of the human condition reflects the doctrine of original sin presented in Augustine's later works, especially in treatises against Pelagius (d. ca. 420) and his followers. Long before Peter Lombard's time, Augustine's teachings had, at least in broad outline, become firmly entrenched in the Latin West.

At first Augustine claimed that the image of God had been totally destroyed by Adam's sin. In later works he retracted this opinion, on the grounds that humans would cease to be rational, morally responsible agents—in effect, would cease to be human—if the image were entirely destroyed. He argued instead that the image of God has been grossly deformed, so that it needs to be *re*formed in Christ, "the second Adam."18 This particular change did not reflect a more optimistic view on the human condition. On the contrary, the doctrine of original sin developed in Augustine's works from 386 onward places growing emphasis on the effects of the Fall and our need for God's grace.

According to Augustine, Adam's descendants inherit both the guilt of his sin and its effects. Only through the grace of baptism can the guilt be remitted. Without baptism, even infants are doomed to hell; but even after baptism, Christians still show the effects of original sin in their tendencies towards self-centeredness, moral blindness, and

<sup>18</sup> Augustine, *De spiritu et littera* (*On the Spirit and the Letter*), 28.48; *Retractationes* (*The Retractations*), 2.51.

weakness of will. Lacking the spiritual dispositions bestowed upon Adam and Eve, and with impaired rational capacities, Christians can never attain perfect virtue in their earthly lives. No matter how hard they try to avoid it, they are bound to sin. Hence Augustine flays pagan philosophers for teaching that humans can indeed become perfectly virtuous, and more, through their own efforts. For him all true virtues are gifts of grace. The virtues extolled by pagans are vices in disguise.19

The doctrine of original sin arises mainly from Augustine's reading of Paul's epistles. He takes them to mean that Adam's sin was not his alone: all of humankind sinned "*in* Adam" and thereby became destined to die. Only through the gift of Christ's sacrifice can people again become righteous and enjoy eternal life (Rom. 5:12–21). For this very reason Paul refers to a second Adam, of heaven rather than the earth (1 Cor. 15:45–47). From Augustine's perspective, then, people who deny original sin are bound to underestimate our need for grace and misunderstand the role of Christ. If a single human being could be righteous apart from the grace of Christ, Augustine argues, then Christ died in vain.20

There was no serious conflict among Christians about whether God became a human being in order to save sinners. Multiple passages of the New Testament deliver this message. The message is nonetheless open to various interpretations, and Augustine's understanding of it triggered objections. On his view, the sole reason for the Incarnation is that Adam's sin did such terrible damage to his descendants. The Incarnation was not a tribute to human dignity, let alone an award for human merit. It was the only way fallen human beings could be redeemed. Since every one of us shares in the guilt of Adam's sin, even

newborn babies need the grace of Christ in order to be spared eternal punishment.21

The greatest challenge to this riveting narrative came from Pelagius and his followers, the foremost defenders in the early church of human dignity. They denied that Adam's sin damaged anyone but himself, except insofar as he set a bad example. On the contrary, all people are born in the same condition as Adam and Eve before the Fall: sinless, and with an unimpaired capacity to choose either good or evil. We succeed or fail according to our individual efforts. We can therefore remain sinless if we exert ourselves to the utmost. While Pelagius and his followers agreed that people need God's grace, they rejected Augustine's idea that we need it to repair damage done to human nature. One might argue, then, that Augustine did them an injustice in casting them as "enemies of grace."22 But from his perspective, Pelagians not only underestimated the importance of Christ, they overestimated the capacities of human nature after the Fall, just as pagan philosophers did. If it is possible to be sinless merely by exerting oneself to the utmost, why has no descendant of Adam ever accomplished this feat?

Augustine's long, bitter campaign against Pelagian teachings largely succeeded. His doctrine of original sin was affirmed by African councils of the church in 416 and 418. In 431, the year following his death, an ecumenical council at Ephesus followed suit. A letter was sent to bishops of the West speaking highly of Augustine's life and works and confirming that the teachings of Pelagius and his followers had been condemned.23

While the condemnations did not explicitly prohibit or prescribe any specific opinions about human dignity, they help to explain why

the narrative of creation, Fall, and redemption became so entrenched, and with it, the idea that the image of God, now disfigured, needs to be reformed. Christians remained free to praise human dignity as God created it in Adam and Eve, or the dignity of human nature, however damaged, as it still exists after the Fall, but as aspects of a longer story culminating in the salvation of *some* humans through the grace of Christ. Nobody on earth, however, could be entirely confident about her ultimate destiny. Christians could lose their special dignity by sinning and regain it only through penance and God's grace.

## Money, Mice, and Maids: Different Kinds of Dignity

With this background, readers might better understand Augustine's remarks about human dignity in *On Free Choice,* a dialogue far more popular today than any of his anti-Pelagian treatises. When he started writing it, his chief target was Manichaean dualism. For this reason he emphasizes the dignity of God-given human nature, even in sinful human beings:

Just as a horse that strays is better than a stone that does not stray only because it has no movement or perception of its own, so a creature that sins by free will is more excellent than one that does not sin because it has no free will. And I would praise wine as something good of its kind, but blame a person who got drunk on the wine, and yet I would prefer that person, drunk and blameworthy, to the wine on which he got drunk…. Even perverse and intoxicated people—ruined by their greed for this same thing, praiseworthy on its own level—are to be preferred to it, not because of the merit of their vices but because of the dignity of their nature.24

<sup>24</sup> Augustine, *De libero arbitrio* (*On Free Choice*), 3.5.15.

Why are even sinful humans better than good horses? Augustine's answer prescinds from their individual defects and focuses on the dignity of their *nature*. Only later in the dialogue does Augustine explain that he uses "human nature" in two senses: to mean the nature with which human beings were first created, but also to mean the nature of their descendants, "mortal and ignorant and enslaved to the flesh."25 Although humans still have the rational capacities of understanding and will, capacities that animals lack, even these capacities are now impaired. Augustine was furious that Pelagians quoted selectively from the dialogue in support of their own views, ignoring the sections that contradicted them.26

In book 11 of *City of God,* a work completed over thirty years later, Augustine gives a much clearer account of dignity than he offers in *On Free Choice.* Not only does he present his distinction between natural dignity and instrumental value, he argues that righteousness trumps even natural dignity:

Among those things that in some way exist, and are distinct from the God who made them, living things are placed above nonliving things, just as those that have the power of reproducing, or even desiring it, are placed above those lacking this impulse; and among living things, the sentient are placed above the nonsentient, as animals are above trees; and among those with understanding, the immortal are placed above the mortal, as angels are above human beings. These, however, are places in the order of nature. There is another way of assessing things according to the use someone has for them, so that we sometimes prefer certain nonsentient things to sentient things…. For example, who would not prefer to have food in his house rather than mice, or money rather than fleas? Why wonder, then, that even in the

<sup>25</sup> Augustine, *De libero arbitrio*, 3.19.54.

<sup>26</sup> Augustine complains about this at some length in *Retractationes*, 1.9.

assessment of human beings themselves, whose nature is certainly of great dignity, a horse is often more precious than a servant, and a gem more precious than a maid? As far as freedom of judgment is concerned, the reason of a thoughtful person is very different from the necessity of a needy person or the pleasure of a person desiring something. For reason considers what degree of value a thing has in itself, whereas necessity thinks about that on account of which it seeks the thing; and reason considers what is shown to be true according to the light of the mind, whereas pleasure looks for what is agreeable in gratifying the bodily senses. But the will and love have such great weight in the value of rational natures that good human beings are placed above bad angels according to the law of righteousness, even though angels are above humans in the order of nature.27

There is nothing original about Augustine's description of the order of nature: the place something has depends on its God-given capacities. The closer they are to God's, the higher the thing's rank in the order of creation. Nor is Augustine original in distinguishing between natural dignity, on the one hand, and mere utility value, on the other. Yet he does not stop here. He advances his own distinction between someone who judges freely and according to reason, considering the value things have in themselves, and someone who judges them in terms of her own physical pleasure or her "necessity."

By "necessity" Augustine means the compulsion we feel to get more of something than we objectively need. Our need for air, for example, rarely influences our value judgments because we seldom perceive a need for it. As long as air is readily available and our respiratory organs work, we feel no compulsion to get more air. In contrast, we often do feel a compulsion to amass more wealth or acquire more power than we need, but not because either gives us some kind of physical

<sup>27</sup> Augustine, *De civitate Dei*, 11.16.

gratification.28 Far from seeing the lust to dominate others as something natural to us, Augustine thinks it reflects the disordering of human nature caused by the Fall.29

Even when we do value things according to their God-given natures, Augustine concludes, we should not think that this is the sole criterion for judgment. Because it matters so much what rational creatures love and how they choose to behave, human beings can, with God's grace, attain a place equal to the good angels and above the bad ones. Unlike Pelagius and his followers, Augustine sees no grounds for despair in the deep, perpetual need for God's grace. While people suffer the consequences of a sin that they did not individually commit, they can also benefit from a sacrifice that they did not individually make.

## Leo the Great and Thomas Aquinas

Anyone who reads the sermons of Leo the Great will be struck by how often he exhorts his listeners to remember the dignity of their nature.30 This can make Leo appear closer to modern proponents of human dignity than to Augustine, the tireless prosecutor of Pelagians. In fact, Leo himself strongly opposed Pelagianism. Even before his ordination as a bishop he began working to suppress it. The dignity he invokes in his sermons is primarily the dignity that Christians have through God's grace. In exhorting his congregants to remember their dignity Leo was also warning them against sliding back into old, bad habits.

<sup>28</sup> Augustine, *Contra Iulianum* (*Against Julian*), 4.14.68.

<sup>29</sup> Augustine sees *superbia—*pride, or perhaps more accurately, arrogance*—*as the source of Adam's sin and likewise the principal root of all sin in fallen human nature. But only later did Christian thinkers develop the scheme of the seven capital vices (or "deadly sins") and begin arguing about exactly where one vice or another, such as lust or anger, ranks on the list.

<sup>30</sup> I use the critical edition of the Latin texts in *Sancti Leonis Magni, Romani Pontificis, Tractatus septem et nonaginta*, ed. Antoine Chavasse, Corpus Christianorum, Series Latina, vols. 128 and 128A (Turnhout: Brepols, 1973). The chapter numbers of the *Tractatus* that I give correspond with the sermon numbers in English translations. I cite the chapter number followed by the relevant page number(s) in the critical edition.

As Christians are always capable of growing, so too are they always at risk of degenerating.31

Leo's understanding of human dignity clearly reflects Augustine's influence. He does not proclaim some universal human dignity that all people have because God made Adam and Eve in his image. Leo mourns the loss of human dignity in Adam and celebrates its restoration in Christ:

Wake up, human being, and recognize the dignity of your nature. Recall that you have been made *according to the image of God*, which, although it has been corrupted in Adam, has nevertheless been reformed in Christ.32

… The human being has been made according to the image of God in order that he might imitate his creator; and our kind has this natural dignity if the form of divine benevolence gleams in us as a kind of mirror. Certainly the Savior's grace restores us to this form on a daily basis, as long as that which fell in the first Adam is raised up in the second.33

The claim that Christ's grace restores us on a daily basis serves as a reminder that baptism is no guarantee of a place in heaven. Since people can lose their dignity by sinning, they have a continual need for grace. Leo makes the warning more explicit in a sermon he preached during Lent:

Let us seek divine help by the observance of the heavenly mandates, knowing that we cannot otherwise prevail against our enemies unless we prevail against ourselves. There are many struggles within ourselves: "the flesh lusts against the spirit," for one thing, and "the

<sup>33</sup> Leo the Great, *Tractatus*, 12, 48.

spirit lusts against the flesh," for another [Gal. 5:17]. If in this strife the desires of the body are stronger, the soul will shamefully lose the dignity proper to it, and it will be ruinous for it to be a slave to what it ought to govern.34

When we turn from Leo's sermons to the works of Thomas Aquinas, we find all the sophistication, but also all the complexities, of scholastic theology. Aquinas so often appeals to the works of Aristotle and his commentators that one can easily underestimate the extent of Augustine's influence.35 In Aquinas's treatment of original sin, though, extensive quotations from Augustine make his influence manifest. Aquinas's own teacher, Albert the Great, had ventured to suggest that God would have become incarnate even if humankind had not sinned. Aquinas reports this opinion as well as Augustine's opinion to the contrary: that if humankind had not sinned, God would not have become incarnate. Noting that scripture repeatedly gives humankind's sin as the reason for the Incarnation, Aquinas sides with Augustine. He adds that his position should not be interpreted as a limit on God's power. God *could* have become incarnate even if there had been no sin.36

This understanding of the Incarnation suggests that we should take it as (humbling) evidence of God's compassion, not as evidence that human beings have greater dignity than all other creatures. As Augustine makes this point, so too does Aquinas. He grants that humans have more dignity than nonrational animals, so that in this sense it was fitting that God become incarnate as a human; but since angels are rational as well, rationality alone cannot explain the Incarnation. Why, then, did God become incarnate as a human instead

<sup>36</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, III.1.3.

of as an angel? According to Aquinas, the answer lies not in human dignity but in human *need*. 37

At last we come to the notorious argument for capital punishment in Aquinas's *Summa theologiae*. It makes more sense when seen in the context of the work as a whole. When Aquinas discusses creation in Part 1 of the *Summa*, he defines a *person* as an individual with a rational nature. Here he defends the special dignity of all persons, ranging from God through angels to humans. As we know, he also argues that humans and angels are the only creatures made in God's image. While human nature is a less perfect image of God than angelic nature, we are still well above brute animals in the hierarchy of creation.38 At the same time Aquinas grants the point made in Augustine's *City of God*: rational beings have a value beyond the value God gave them in creation, so that some virtuous humans can ultimately come to surpass some of the angels.39

When Aquinas argues for capital punishment in the second part of Part 2, he has moved beyond the metaphysics of creation, through psychology and ethics in general, into a treatise on Christian ethics. He begins with the God-given virtues of faith, hope, and charity, then presents his account of God-given cardinal virtues, along with vices and sins opposed to them. The cardinal virtue of justice leads to a discussion of murder, including the question of whether it is lawful to kill sinners. Aquinas argues that it is lawful if the individual is not merely a sinner but a serious danger to the community, so that killing him is necessary for the common good. In subsequent articles he clarifies his position. Not only does he argue that only a publicly appointed authority may kill a sinner, he argues that someone operating as a private person cannot even kill herself without committing a mortal sin.40

<sup>37</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, III.4.1.

<sup>38</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, I.29.3 ad 2, 93.3.

<sup>39</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, I.20.4 ad 2.

<sup>40</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, II–II.64.2–3, 5.

The passage where Aquinas contends that people can become beastlike by sinning, so that it can be good to kill them, is not included in his main response to the question about the lawfulness of killing sinners. He presents this argument in reply to one of the opening arguments, which claims that killing a human being is evil in itself and therefore never lawful, under any circumstances. Aquinas's reply appeals to scripture as well as Aristotle:

In sinning a human withdraws from the order of reason and hence falls away from human dignity, according to which a human is naturally free and exists for his own sake, and he falls in a certain way (*quoddammodo*) into the servitude of beasts, so that it is ordained that he be treated according as he is useful to others, according to the Psalm [48:11], "The human, when he was in honor, did not understand; he has been compared to senseless beasts and made like them," and as it is said in Proverbs [11:29], "The fool shall serve the wise." And for this reason, although killing a human who remains in his own dignity is intrinsically evil, nevertheless killing a sinner can be good, just as killing a beast can be good. For a bad human being is worse than a beast and more harmful, as the Philosopher says in *Politics* I and [*Nicomachean*] *Ethics* VII.41

Aquinas's qualification—that some sinners fall *in a certain way* into the servitude of beasts—indicates that they have not altogether lost their personhood. Even so, readers might well wonder how executing people can make them useful to others. By making an example of them, so that the death penalty deters others from sinning? While this might be the case, Aquinas probably has something more in mind.

In his *Disputed Questions on Truth* Aquinas uses the same passage from Psalms to argue that God's providence always treats people justly.

<sup>41</sup> Aquinas, *Summa theologiae*, II–II.64.2 ad 3. This passage looks more radical in the English Dominicans' translation of the *Summa theologiae*, which omits the qualification "in a certain way."

If they live in a way consistent with human dignity, nothing will happen to them that is not for their own good; but if they do not, God ordains that they be treated like brute animals, for the good of others.42 This conception of God's providence is one that Augustine repeatedly defends, arguing that God brings good even from the evil of sin. In both cases the central idea is one of order. If human beings choose higher goods over lower ones, as God intended, they preserve divine order. If they instead choose lower goods over higher ones, thereby making bad use of their capacity for free choice, punishing them serves to restore the order they violated.

## Conclusion

I have argued that two factors do much to explain why the patristic and medieval literature has little to say about the species-wide, speciesspecific human dignity commonly debated today. First, most authors believed that humans are not the sole creatures with the capacities for understanding and free choice. Not only do angels have the same capacities, possibly in even higher form, they are spiritual beings that, by their very nature, cannot die. It seemed reasonable to conclude, then, that God gave angels even greater dignity than he gave Adam and Eve. Second, most authors thought that human nature is not in the same condition that it was when God created it. According to what I have called the dominant narrative, the image of God in humankind had been deformed by the Fall; it needs to be reformed in the likeness of Christ; and cannot be reformed in any other way. It follows that Christians, through God's gift of grace, have a dignity that other people lack. (Remember, though, that Christians can lose their dignity by sinning. Whether they recover it depends, yet again, on God's grace.)

<sup>42</sup> Aquinas, *Quaestiones disputatae de veritate* (*Disputed Questions on Truth*), vol. 22 in *Opera Omnia iussu Leonis XII* (Rome, 1970–76), 5.7.

Let me close with some very brief remarks about a dissenting strain in medieval thought, with a higher assessment of human dignity. It faults the dominant narrative for placing too much emphasis on rational capacities of the soul that humans share with the angels. After all, the human soul's powers include animal functions, such as sense perception, and even "vegetable" functions like growth. Equally important, humans have an immortal soul made by God to desire union with the body. The whole that the two form gives the human being unique status as a microcosm: a reflection of all living things. So in making Adam from the earth, the dissenting strain claims, God did not give him less dignity than he gave the angels. On the contrary, God made the human being the most honored of all living creatures.

Versions of this line of argument appear in works by John Scotus Eriugena and Robert Grosseteste, as well as in the composite treatise entitled *On the Dignity of the Creation of Humanity*. 43 In Grosseteste's work it comes combined with another doctrine still sometimes mistaken for an innovation by John Duns Scotus. Some call it the primacy of Christ, others the absolute predestination of Christ. Defenders of this doctrine grant that Christ redeemed humankind from sin, but they argue for a counterfactual: Christ would have become incarnate even if there had been no Fall. For it is the union of God and humanity in Christ that unifies creation and fulfills God's plan for the universe.44

Dales, "A Medieval View of Human Dignity," *Journal of the History of Ideas* 38 (1977): 557–72; Dermot Moran, "John Scottus Eriugena," in *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Fall 2008 ed.), ed.

Christian variations on the ancient theme of human being as microcosm certainly support claims for the special dignity of humankind. One might wonder, though, whether they give the kind of support that contemporary defenders of human dignity would welcome. Arguments for the primacy of Christ might do better than the dominant narrative in celebrating specifically human dignity, but only in a derivative way, and they prove every bit as resistant to secularization.

The avid attention devoted to law in the early and medieval historical periods of Islamic scholarship, together with the sheer volume of literature this endeavor produced, might by itself seem to justify the view that Islam, in its classical expression, was predominantly a religion of law.1 But the more important fact to register is that within the Islamic tradition, theoretically, a perfect distinction is not drawn between the realm of the spiritual and the realm of the temporal when it comes to legislation of law: the field of law, or Sharīʿah, focuses on the systematic regulation of *all* aspects of human conduct and interaction.2 Within this context, classical legal discourses included detailed expositions of

issues ranging from political governance and administration to commerce and family law, which featured alongside equally rigorous treatments of ritual topics, including the formalities of ablution, prayer, alms payment, fasting, rites of pilgrimage, dietary regulations, and even dress code.3 But legal issues were also a salient feature of theological deliberations, wherein the juridical import of topics such as autonomy, morality, divine justice, theodicy, deserts, and causality was fleshed out with regards to normative human conduct. Even Islamic ethicists, who examined morality within the context of the pursuit of human refinement, adduced materials synoptically distilled from traditional scriptural sources and wisdom literature that complemented the already burgeoning corpus of legalistic literature and materials.4

Given the sheer breadth and scale of Islamic legal thought and the variety of its formats, it is unsurprising that discussions relevant to conceptions of dignity do feature prominently among its discourses.5 Indeed, across the broad range of legal, theological, and ethical literature one does find subtle references to topics such as honor, rank, station, self-esteem, respect, integrity, inalienable worth, and gravitas broached from a fascinating gamut of perspectives and standpoints. With a view to exploring understandings of dignity in classical Islamic thought, this chapter will set out to trace the historical background

<sup>3</sup> Also significant is the rapid spread of the Islamic conquests: within thirty-years of the Prophet's death, large swathes of the Near and Middle East, previously under the control of the Byzantine and Persian empires, were now under Islamic rule; and the conquests spread to the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, India, and North Africa.

Debes does point out that studies are axiomatic in claiming that "dignity is beset by ambiguity in use." He also argues that those who claim that the concept's being "messy" and "hard to define" is indicative of its "fundamental character" overlook that this might be construed by some as confirming its "inscrutable" nature; and that a "conscientious *metatheory* about what dignity is, might remedy the manifest ambiguity in how we talk about it." Debes notes that discussions are "dominated by the Kantian and Judeo-Christian traditions that make dignity a function of, respectively, rational autonomy or spiritual identity with God (*imago Dei*)," although in his survey no mention is made of the Islamic perspectives.

and development of the various discussions, situating their relevance within the vector of current western academic surveys of the concept of dignity.6 Significantly, this will allow a broader gauging of their relevance to current debates on the challenges of modernity and reform in Islam, within which the concept of dignity is often invoked.

Interestingly, the immense interest that discourses on dignity have attracted recently across a range of fields and areas, including political, legal, theological, philosophical, anthropological, and bioethical treatments of the subject, has extended to include surveys in which Islamic perspectives on dignity relative to those fields and strands of thought have been gauged.7 The number of these studies is steadily increasing and includes surveys of the subject based solely on the jurisprudential aspects of the discussions, and those that seek to explore conceptions of dignity with historical reference to classical theological and ethical discourses.8 While it is often assumed that classical Islamic treatments of the subject of dignity were derivative, showing neither resourcefulness

nor originality, it will be shown that such conclusions were reached on the basis of a narrow focus on confined aspects of the relevant literature without taking into consideration the holistic dynamic through which classical writers were able to broach the subject with reference to legal, theological, and ethical perspectives. Moreover, the range of approaches to the subject demonstrates the sheer potential of the sources and the fact that within them a broad range of standpoints is accommodated.

It should be noted that from a historiographical perspective the traditional narratives of early Islam are the subject of much debate in terms of their authenticity. This is due to the paucity of the source materials from these early periods; indeed, it is mostly through later literary texts that early materials are preserved.9 Still, this in no way impinges upon the intellectual fecundity and literary value of the extant sources. It simply hinders attempts to date the historical genesis of the beliefs and doctrines that were later defined as being characteristic of authentic expressions of the faith. Moreover, the wealth of literary materials produced during the first three centuries of the Islamic tradition serves as distinct testimony to its intellectual achievements. Highly sophisticated traditions of learning had already developed at the end of the ninth century ce, with impressive literary works being produced across a range of areas including law, theology, exegesis, grammar, philology, history, and biography. Notwithstanding scholarship in the religious disciplines, a rich tradition of study in the natural philosophical sciences developed.10 This golden age of learning and

erudition was followed by equally prolific achievements in scholarship during the later medieval periods. Scholars of this subsequent era were not vapidly replicating earlier discussions, but rather augmenting and evolving the intellectual scholarship bequeathed to them, rendering it relevant to new challenges and encounters.

## Historical Context of the Faith and Its Sources

With due emphasis placed on the importance of tradition and precedent, Islamic legal rulings and doctrinal teachings are essentially linked to two scriptural sources: the Qur'an and the Prophetic Sunna (normative custom).11 Divided among 114 chapters of varying length, the Qur'an comprises over six thousand verses covering theological, legal, ethical, and eschatological themes. Traditional sources intimate that the Qur'an was revealed piecemeal over a twenty-twoyear period between 610 ce and 632 ce Chronologically, revelation associated with the early years of the Prophet's career at Mecca tended to evoke theological and ethical themes, while following the migration to Medina, which was designated the start of the Muslim calendar (622 ce), these were augmented with materials of a distinctly legal countenance. This was a reflection of the change in the fortunes of the nascent Muslim community: adherents of the faith were largely persecuted at Mecca, while at Medina they were permitted to practice their faith and share in the political process; Qur'anic

<sup>11</sup> The concept of Sunna did have a pre-Islamic provenance, personifying all that was principled in ancient tribal custom and practice. The traditional chronology surrounding the concept of the Prophetic Sunna and its genesis are disputed in modern scholarship: the emergence of Sunnism from a proto-religious movement is viewed as being conveniently glossed over in the traditional Islamic sources. Yet debates and arguments about the historical emergence of the Sunna and the origins of *ḥadīths* are actually academic, in the loose sense of the word, for the simple reason that for classical scholarship these sources provided the materials for the articulation of legal thought.

revelation from the latter period frequently engages with the change of circumstances.

Significantly, Islam does not present itself as a distinctively new religious faith but one that openly shares a common prophetic and scriptural heritage with the religions of Judaism and Christianity; its message is one of revival and restoration.12 Islam presents the figure of Muhammad as one of a long line of divinely appointed messengers, all of whom promulgated monotheistic teachings, and some were recipients of scripture. Thus, while the Qur'an is extolled as a revealed text, so too are the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospels. Jews and Christians are referred to by the Qur'an as the *ahl alkitāb* (people of divinely revealed scripture); the Qur'an frequently states that it was "confirming what had been revealed previously" (Q. 5:50), adding, "Dispute not with the People of the Book, except with reverence, save those who grossly err, and say to them: 'We accept what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to you; indeed our God and your God is one and to him we submit'" (Q. 29:45).13 Notwithstanding the fact that there exist doctrinal divergences between Islam and its monotheistic sister faiths, this qualification does not attenuate Islam's view of the sacrosanct nature of the original scriptures. From a legal perspective, the status of these communities is connected to this fact. Theoretically, there existed a restricted sense in which the prescriptions of the Sharīʿa, in terms of obligations and responsibilities, were applied to such communities as confirmed by historical anecdotes, such as: "With regards to the protected peoples, matters germane to rights, transactions and inheritance should be delegated to their co-religionists,

<sup>12</sup> It is frequently assumed that Qur'anic materials were digressions from a body of normative materials or perfunctorily distilled from a miscellany of traditional and apocryphal biblical sources; however, there is an internal dynamic that prefigures the Qur'an's treatment of personalities and themes; common sources are shared, but attitudes and approaches to figures and ideas differ entirely.

<sup>13</sup> Variations are explained by classical Islamic scholars as resulting from either alterations or distortions of the contents of the original message.

unless they desire otherwise."14 Furthermore, the Qur'an states, "If they come to you (the Prophet) seeking your judgment, then offer it imparting justice." It then moves on to comment, "Why should they seek your arbitration when they have in their possession the Torah and the Gospels?" (Q. 5:43).15

Although from a hierarchical perspective the Qur'an serves as the preeminent source of counsel, its legal directives were frequently expounded upon through reference to the Prophetic Sunna, which was later preserved within the body of materials referred to as the traditions or *ḥadīth*s.16 The inference is that in his lifetime the Prophet clarified and given context to the teachings enshrined within the Qur'an, bestowing an all-encompassing code of practice that his followers and later generations of adherents were entreated to emulate.17

The traditional view is this "living custom" was safeguarded for posterity in the years following the Prophet's death and eventually preserved and transmitted through a variety of oral and written means. There exist hundreds of thousands of *ḥadīths*, and using methods of criticism based on the scrutiny of their intricate chains of transmission, scholars in the ninth and tenth centuries

He remarks that "the Islamic legal treatment of non-Muslims is symptomatic of the more general challenge of governing a diverse polity," concluding at the same time that "the pursuit of pluralism through the institutions of law and governance is a messy business." The term *dhimmī* is linked to notions of protection.

<sup>16</sup> A *ḥadīth* is made up of two components: the *matn* (the actual text or account of what is being transmitted on the authority of the Prophet); and its *isnād* (support or chain of transmission).

<sup>17</sup> It is argued that far from representing authentic records of the early years of Islam, these *ḥadīth*s were subjective attempts to project an idealized and impressionistic portrayal of early Islam.

ce identified a core of materials that essentially furnished the "raw materials" used for the formulation of the practices and teachings associated with ritual and law. Much of the scholarly activity of the eighth and ninth centuries ce was symbolized by a quest to reconstruct the exemplar of the Prophetic Sunna through circumspect reference to the constellation of materials derived from the Qur'an and the Hadīth. The collation, codification, and interpretation of these data represented one of the defining features of scholarship in these early periods.18 Decisively, this scholarship sustained the juridical and associated scholarship of later medieval periods.19 Indeed, today classical materials are not obsolete relics from the past but continue to influence legal discourses and deliberations in the Arab and Islamic world.20

Over the course of Islamic history four schools of jurisprudence came to dominate legal thought: the eponymously formed Ḥanafī, Mālikī, Shāfi'ī, and Ḥanbalī traditions of thought, which are all associated with the Sunni branch of Islam.21 Despite the fact that there has been a tendency to view Islamic law as being immutable, the inherent depth and variety of the sources permitted flexibility in the interpretation of juridical points and perspectives, allowing a fostering of different understandings of the law across a range of issues. Schools of scholastic theology also flourished and were ideologically linked with the legal schools. While adopting a different set of hierarchical principles and paradigms, the Shia schools anchored their heritage to the

<sup>20</sup> In the formative periods jurists developed principles for the synthesis and systematization of the sources of law with reference to the Qur'an and the *ḥadīths*, using earlier conventions and precedents as analogues to refine legal concepts such as analogical reasoning (*qiyās*) and community consensus (*ijmāʿ*). Through a process of deduction, *qiyās* allowed jurists to extend the finite body of sources to deal with unprecedented points of law.

teaching of their imams (designated spiritual leaders), developing their own schools of thought.22

## Foundations and Paradigms

While the origin of the concept of dignity in Judeo-Christian religious discourses is historically linked with the basic notion that man was created in the image of God (*imago Dei*), Islamic teachings are typically viewed as originating in the various Qur'anic dicta in which frequent direct references and allusions are made to the revered status of humankind. Incidentally, the Qur'an is categorical in stressing the incomparable nature of the divine essence, proclaiming, "Nothing exists which can compare to Him and He is the all hearing the all seeing" (Q. 42:11). Indeed, in the view of rational theologians, the fact that God is an utterly transcendent being militates against the invocation of an anthropomorphic analogue between the creator and the created; so the notion of *imago Dei* is something that rational Islamic theologians rejected.23 However, it has been suggested that initially a number of eighth century ce *ḥadīth* specialists did invoke dicta that made mention of the term *imago Dei.* The suggestion is that as antianthropomorphic views held sway among certain scholars, such reports were shunned, especially in exegetical literature and by rational theologians who were uncomfortable with the literal connotations of man being created in the image of God, although *ḥadīth* scholars did continue to uphold their veracity. Nevertheless, although these reports

<sup>22</sup> Differences between Sunni and Shia expressions of Islam turned on the issue of the leadership of the community: within Shiism the view was that the leadership of the community was divinely determined and it was the exclusive dominion of the members of the house of the Prophet. Offshoots from Shiism include the Ismāʿīlīs and Zaydīs.

<sup>23</sup> See Christopher Melchert, "God Created Adam in His Image," *Journal of Qur'anic Studies* 13, no. 1 (2011): 113–24. Theologians of a rationalist persuasion tended to favor a view that God's creating man in his form should be understood in the abstract sense of commensurate with fine qualities embodied by God's attributes and not implying any physical correlation. Cf. Yair Lorberbaum, "Human Dignity in the Jewish Tradition," in Düwell et al., *Handbook of Human Dignity*, 135–44; and McCrudden, "Pursuit of Human Dignity," 28–33.

may have been in vogue, they were never made the raison d'être of the concept of dignity, nor did they form part of a unified attempt to articulate ideas connected with this notion. The closest one gets to a correlation is the fact that in one of the versions of the *imago Dei ḥadīths*, reference is made to the Prophet's discouraging the striking of one's brother on the face on account of his being created in the image of God.24 This was sometimes explained in terms of underscoring the respect accorded to humans as God's creation; a further connection to this idea is provided by the Qur'anic verse that speaks of God's creating Adam using his own "hands" (Q. 38:75): again, it was cited to illustrate the high esteem in which humans were held by God.25 Certainly, the Qur'an's overall message is one of salvation and within this context the concern for human dignity is not only presented as a given within the text, but it is intricately anchored to notions of divine imperative and command.

In the classical sources the essential idea of man's dignity in the sense of his honor (*karāma*), prestige (ʿ*izz*), sanctity (*ḥurma*), inherent status and rank (*manzila*), and his inalienable worth (*qīma*) is not attributed to a single Qur'anic verse or theme but features in recurring motifs across various verses and exempla.26 Specific verses quoted in support of broader conceptions of the elevated status and dignity of humankind included "Verily we have bestowed honour upon the sons of Adam and facilitated their travel over land and sea, granting them all things good and fine; likewise, we have granted exceptional preference to them over much of our creation"

<sup>24</sup> Rational theologians did attempt to obviate the anthropomorphic import of such traditions.

<sup>25</sup> Those of a rationalist inclination paraphrased the word "hands" with "grace." The debates between medieval rationalist and traditionalist theologians on the literal contra metaphorical implications of the discussions are heated. The former favored the use of dialectical arguments and strategies, while the latter were apprehensive about their employment, rejecting the use of metaphor to explain away language that is found on the Qur'an.

<sup>26</sup> Other Arabic terms used include *jāh* (repute) and *iḥtirām* (respect and veneration). One does need to bear in mind that the Qur'an is essentially liturgical in its format and that its narratives are often allusive.

(Q. 17:70).27 In the verse the all-encompassing nature of this act of bestowing "honor," or *karam*, upon mankind appears unassailable and can be linked to the notion of the unearned worth of humans. Some classical commentators speculatively drew a correlation between the elevated status of humankind and the fact that humans were rational and sentient beings; others referred to man's unique physical features as constituting markers of his status.28 More significantly, specific verses such as Q. 2:30 heralded man's preeminence and rank among creation, referring to his being made a vicegerent on earth to whom the angels were commanded to prostrate; by the same token, verses such as Q. 95:4 declared that "man was created with the finest of constitutions," confirming the Qur'anic view of humankind's uniqueness among creation. Likewise, primacy granted to the welfare and well-being of humans is justified by verses such as Q. 45:13, in which it is stated, "He subjected all that is in the heavens and earth for your [man's] benefit." Despite their general semantic sweep, the aforementioned Qur'anic statements would have formed the substrate for discussions across a constellation of legal issues and perspectives in which the inalienable worth of humans is an overriding consideration and brought to bear on the interpretation and application of the law.29

Alongside the Qur'an, the material of the Prophetic traditions played a salient role in shaping the articulation of legal thought with standpoints on law and theology defined through the concomitant reference to these sources. In the corpora of the *ḥadīth*s there exists a phenomenal amount of materials on the sanctity of life, equality,

modesty, the rights of fellow human beings, rank, gravitas, kindness, acts of charity, courteousness, and honor, all of which presuppose an understanding of concepts and constructs associated with the innate worth not only of mankind but all of creation. Significantly, the classical literary texts in which Prophetic traditions were collated and authenticated included within them lengthy chapters devoted to *adab* (etiquette) in which moral rectitude and accountability are encouraged across a range of areas that intersect with key themes found in the discourses on dignity.30

## Ethical Literature and Thought

The genesis of ethical and protreptic literature confirms the sophistication with which classical scholarship developed ideas on the notion of the innate worth of individuals and egalitarianism. Taking their

<sup>30</sup> These include *ḥadīth*s such as "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab; nor a non-Arab over an Arab except by virtue of piety; you are all (the offspring of ) Adam and he was (created) from clay." It also includes statements that denounce the killing of non-Muslims, such as "He who takes the life of a protected person will never savour the scent of paradise"; as well as traditions that mandate that the dead be treated with respect and dignity, such as "The fracturing (or breaking) of a dead person's bones is akin to the violation of a living person"; and that refer to the rights of neighbors: "Whoever believes in God and the Day of Judgement, must not harm his neighbour." But this is not the limit of respect. On the contrary, the notion of respect for *all* creation is enshrined in a variety of traditions such as the recounting of the parable of a man on a journey who, overcome by thirst, descends into a well to quench it. Having done so, he continues his journey and comes across a panting dog so overwhelmed by thirst that he is "licking" the soil. Pitying the dog, he slips off his leather "sock" and descends once more into the well, filling it with water before climbing out with his sock clasped between his teeth, proceeding to quench the dog's thirst. The tradition ends with mention of God's having shown gratitude to this individual, pardoning him for his sins, to which the companions of the Prophet declared: "Are we rewarded (for acts of kindness) to animals?" The Prophet replied with an emphatic yes! Indeed, there are numerous traditions that inveigh against the abuse of any living creature, condemning blood sports, the degradation of animals for pleasure, and their confinement to cages; and mandating that they be spared from suffering if they are slaughtered. (Interestingly, the Kantian position posits that "as far as animals are concerned, we have no direct duties" and that they are a means to an end, while the Islamic position is one that grants that they should not be treated as a means. Of course, Kant does argue that man is obliged to desist from the punishment or illtreatment of animals.) There are even traditions that denounce the gratuitous destruction of trees. See the *ḥadīth* collections of al-Bukhārī (d. 870), Muslim (d. 875), Abū Dāwūd (d. 888), al-Nasāʾī (d. 915), al-Tirmidhī (d. 892), and Ibn Mājah (d. 886). Bukhārī was the author of one of Sunni orthodoxy's most renowned compendium of traditions. The "refinements of morality" tradition features in the major collections.

cue from general Qur'anic statements and select teachings from the Prophetic traditions, ethicists evolved literary genres that aesthetically probed a range of topics and themes connected with conceptions of dignity. Such works appeared under the rubric of *kutub al-ādāb wa'lakhlāq* (the books of etiquette and morals) and perfected an appealingly unpretentious way of engaging with ideals that celebrated moral conduct, decency, and respect for all. These works were not working independently of the traditional sources but feeding off the general tenor of their standpoints on the rectitude of morality, especially as the Prophet was reported to have pronounced that he "was sent to perfect the refinements of morality."

The genre of ethical writings attracted an eclectic range of approaches, providing a fecund framework for the synthesis of ideas. Among the early works is the *Kitāb Makārim al-akhlāq* (The Book of Moral Qualities) composed by Ibn Abī'l-Dunyā (d. 894).31 He eschewed non-Islamic materials, but later medieval writers who produced works in the field of *ādāb* (etiquette) and *akhlāq* (morals) certainly adduced Greek, Persian, and Indian wisdom teachings, fusing them with materials derived from traditional sources. The brand of humanistic ideas defined as "normative secular ethics" is to found in the writings of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 1033) and Miskawayhi (d. 1030).32 Al-Tawḥīdī produced an impressive array of treatises on subjects ranging from works on friendship and morality to texts that debated philosophy and skepticism. Making innovative use of an eclectic selection of sources such as the Qur'an, the traditions, and Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, he was able to produce inspired treatments of topics in which themes such as freedom of expression, respect, virtue, honor, grace,

veneration for humans, and morality were extolled as essential qualities. Commending not only their aesthetic merits, Tawḥīdī set about identifying their functional relevance in ways which revealed a fortiori their compatibility with the spirit of the teachings of the religious tradition. The aim in such texts is to work toward defining an allencompassing moral code that intersects with religious values, showing an appreciation of the quest that humans shared a common destiny.

The work of Miskawayhi reflects the vitality of the genre of ethical writing and has been described by one recent author as providing a framework for "critical appropriation" and "integration," allowing "individuality, creativity, tolerance, freedom of choice and benevolence to thrive."33 Miskawayhi composed both the *Tahdhīb al-akhlāq* (The Refinement of Morals) and the seminal *Tartīb al-sa*ʿ*ādāt* (Preparation for Happiness).34 His works emphasize the importance of the individual and the pursuit of his refinement, fostering ideas that do resonate in the discourses associated with dignity. Miskawayhi influenced the thought of Ghazālī (d. 1111), whose contributions to Islamic intellectual discourses were immense.35 He was able to assimilate Miskawayhi's general synthesis of ethical and mystical paradigms in his own works such as the *Iḥyāʾ* '*ulūm al-dīn* (Revivification of the Religious Sciences) and other key treatises; and it is the theme of human refinement

The traces of Miskawayhi's thought are also found in the celebrated work on ethics entitled *Akhlāq-i Nāṣirī*, composed by the Persian philosopher and astronomer Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (d. 1274). Incidentally, it has been noted that he anticipated aspects of Kant's notion of the categorical imperative "by over five centuries" when he asserted "that an act was authentically moral only in terms of the intention that accompanies it, unsullied by self-interest or mock virtues."36 The mystical tradition provided a rich spiritual environment within which themes of human perfection and refinement were enthused with theosophical ideas; therein the commitment to moral decency together with respect for others was considered quintessential.37

Of particular interest with regards to the theoretical dimensions of arguments about morality is the influence of the theological movement known as the Muʿtazila, whose earliest proponents were active in the eighth century ce. Espousing a distinctive brand of rational theology and dialectics, and influenced by Greek philosophical and logical ideas, the Muʿtazila advocated deference to the primacy of reason as the sole arbiter of truth.

The work of the mystic Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī (d. 386/966) provides an excellent template for the synthesis of legal, ethical, and mystical paradigms and within which the notion of the dignity is linked to personal piety and refinement.

just, they also dismissed exclusively fideistic approaches to doctrine. Within this schema, it was postulated that God always acts in consonance with the dictates of reason. Ex hypothesi, qualities that determine the nature of either good or evil had to be discerned through objective rational enquiry, in the sense that "justice and goodness have a real existence."38 Citing rational proofs, they disavowed the doctrine of predestination, explaining that divine justice predicates that man must be a free and responsible agent. And their theologians excoriated attempts to describe the divine essence through reference to crude anthropomorphism, insisting that God was utterly transcendent.

There was a countermovement to the Muʿtazila led by a former adherent of the school, al-Ashʿarī (d. 935), who developed a synthesis of orthodox doctrine steeped in rationalism but who supported the doctrine of predestination, articulating it in ways that made man an agent through a theory of acquisition, thereby preserving the notion of divine omnipotence. Ashʿarī theologians rejected the Muʿtazila's thesis that God's actions were governed by the same ethical standards to which humans were expected to adhere, dismissing it as being a presumptuous imposition on the divine being. Dismissing the Muʿtazilī deontological framework, they adopted what has been described as "voluntaristic occasionalism" or "theistic subjectivism," believing that "ethical valuations of actions are grounded neither in the acts themselves nor in their properties."39 According to the Ashʿarī position, the ontology of an act in terms of its being either morally reprehensible or good was determined by divine revelation. However, there is no suggestion that Ashʿarī notions of the significance of dignity and morality

were compromised by such abstract postulates. In the Muʿtazilī view respect for the autonomy of individuals and their inherent worth issued from the school's conception of divine justice, which would make no sense if individuals were not able to exercise choice. Even the idea of rewards and punishments in the hereafter was premised on a rigorous epistemology of human free will. Muʿtazilī abstraction in this regards was not an exercise in grounding personal rights in a philosophical sense, but using the idea of free will and responsibility to interpret key theological and legal paradigms.

There were scholars who preferred to configure their digests of morality and etiquette primarily around the conventional scriptural sources, and this was certainly true of jurists associated with the Ḥanbalī school. The work of Ibn Mufliḥ (d. 1362) entitled *al-Ādāb al-shar*ʿ*iyya* (Traditionalist Ethics) exemplifies this approach. In the introduction he explains that the book comprises materials on etiquette that all should aspire to understand and discharge. Undeniably, the work adopts a somewhat sedate and formal approach, accentuating individual effort in the refinement of character, but themes associated with dignity interweave throughout the discussions. This emphasis on good character and the treatment of others with due respect is no surprise given that there exists a Prophetic dictum stating, "Nothing bears more upon the scales of justice than the rectitude of character." Even scholars renowned for their substantive contribution to legal theory and thought were actively involved in composing treatises that pored over the merits of the pursuit of moral rectitude and ethical justice, a fact that confirms the variety of approaches to ethics and morality countenanced within the Islamic tradition: the Andalusian scholar Ibn Ḥazm (d. 1064) and the Iraqi jurist al-Māwardī (d. 1058) were both authors of such works. The former composed *Kitāb al-akhlāq wa'l-siyar* (The Book of Morality and Demeanor); the latter authored the *Adab al-dunyā wa'l-dīn* (Temporal and Spiritual Ethics). At the other end of the spectrum, within the field of philosophy, individuals such as al-Kindī (d. 870), Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (d. 925), al-Fārābī (d. 950), Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037), Ibn Rushd (d. 1198), and Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1209) had already made enormous strides in conceiving highly intellectualist syntheses of ethics and justice that promoted the idea of dignity and rights.40 Certainly, the observation has been made that "the Qur'an did not attempt to regulate every detail of life in the ways worked out by the traditional law school" and that "it permitted and encouraged independent ethical thinking," and this is evidenced by the attention devoted to *adab* literature by classical Islamic theologians, jurists, and philosophers.41

## Engaging with the Discourse of Dignity

To appreciate the underlying legal, theological, and ethical thrust of Qur'anic legislation and teachings, one does need to bear in mind the historical contexts in which they were principally set. Traditional accounts present pre-Islamic beliefs and practices as embodying an aberration from primitive monotheism; they intimate that the pre-Islamic Arabs perverted not only the rites and beliefs associated with expressions of monotheism to which the Qur'an was advocating a return, but also created a society in which inequality, discrimination, oppression, and subjugation of the weak were allowed to fester.42 In the pre-Islamic milieu lineage and pedigree were considered key

<sup>42</sup> Mecca was dominated by tribes and clans who wielded considerable powers. Generosity and protection of the weak were lauded as significant values in pre-Islamic poetry. There are suggestions that the Islamic sources inflated the negative aspects of pre-Islamic Arabia, although key elements of the narrative of the Qur'an are predicated on their railing against the Meccan milieu and its inclination to idolatry.

indicators of honor, prestige, and rank. This status quo is challenged at many junctures in the Qur'an, although perhaps the most significant pericope that taps into the Qur'anic position is the verse that states, "Oh mankind, we have created you from male and female, establishing you into peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, in God's sight, the most noble of you is he who is most pious" (Q. 49:13). Evidently, such statements had far-reaching implications, as they radically challenged societal norms and mores, dismissing the relevance of pedigree and wealth as markers of status.43 The semantics of this verse appear to turn not on the advocacy of gradations of status on the basis of piety, which is ultimately an interior quality and not requisite in any legal sense, but rather on its predicating the dignified status of humans and their worth, advocating a "leveling up" in the treatment of others.44 In Islam the pre-Islamic ideals of *ḥasab* (pedigree) and *nasab* (lineage) did retain their symbolic importance as paradigms of merit and excellence, but from a more general perspective of the law, these ideals had little impact with regards to rights and privileges, although genealogical qualification did become a prerequisite for caliphal office.45

<sup>43</sup> According to Adam Smith (d. 1790), the idea of dignity was tied to "expressions of social rank or the virtue of self-command and thus never refers directly to the inherent value of persons as it often does in contemporary theory." See Remy Debes, "Adam Smith on Dignity and Equality," *British Journal for the History of Philosophy* 20, no. 1 (2012): 110.

<sup>44</sup> Cf. Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 144. In Waldron's thesis dignity is anchored to notions of honor and the relationship with status.

<sup>45</sup> Some traditions state that ethnicity should not be a factor in selecting the leader of a community. With regards to the leadership of the community, the Khārijites, a religio-political movement in early Islam, rejected the qualification of *nasab*, arguing that personal merit trumped lineage. In his seminal collection of Prophetic traditions the compiler Abū Dawūd al-Sijistānī included a section on the balefulness of "Boasting of One's Ancestry." Among the traditions included in the section is a dictum that pronounces to the Arabs, "God has saved you from the conceit of the period of ignorance in which boasting of one's genealogy prevailed: (among you is) the virtuous believer and the impiously wicked, yet you are all the sons of Adam and Adam was created from clay." Likewise, the innate worth of all humans is alluded to in a tradition included in al-Bukhārī's collection in the section devoted to funeral prayers. There it is recounted that the Prophet was asked why he had stood up to pay his respect to a passing funeral cortège as the deceased was a Jew and not from the Muslim faith; his response was "Is this not a soul?"

Significantly, the very idea of upholding justice and righteousness in the treatment of others is lucidly encapsulated in the Qur'an verse that declares, "God decrees that that you act with justness and benevolence, showing kindness to kith and kin; and that you refrain from acts of indecency, repugnance, and dishonour" (Q. 16:90); and "Oh you who truly believe, be just and bear witness to God, even if it against yourselves, your parents or indeed those very close to you" (Q. 4:135). It is belief in the equal rank of humans and respect for others to which the verse, together with the Qur'an's ideas about social justice, ultimately alludes; and the implication is that such verses censure the treatment of individuals as objects, while encouraging impartiality, honorableness, and fairness.46 In this regard, the dignity of individuals lies in their being protected from degradation and contempt.47

Interestingly, although working with a very a confined pool of materials and glossing over the elaborateness of expressions of dignity within the classical Islamic tradition, Miklós Maróth has argued that the scriptural sources give the impression that "there is an inequality in respect of human dignity between Muslims and non-Muslims, between owners of a sacred book and between members of all other religious communities." He concludes that, because dignity is God's gift to mankind, it is seemingly confined to all those "persons who live according to his commandments."48 He does accept that "other people's dignity" would be respected by those who link it to acting piously.

<sup>46</sup> Waldron, referring to Gregory Vlastos's essay on justice and equality, does make a cogent point about the idea of nobility and rank being exploited to elevate all through transvaluation; and one wonders whether the Islamic focus on the quality of piety, and even encouraging the pursuit of knowledge, anticipates that line of enquiry. See Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 35f. The Qur'an and the Prophetic traditions consistently laud the pursuit of knowledge, intimating a higher rank is accorded to those who are learned, but the function of such statements is chiefly paraenetic.

Reading the same range of scriptural sources, others have asserted that rights are issued through "sovereign favour," but there is no indication that they are exclusive. Indeed, Mohammad Kamali has made the case that verses such as Q. 17:70 provided unqualified affirmation of the universal nature of man's dignity. He quoted the nineteenth-century Qur'an commentator al-Alusī, whose view was that the verse in question intimates that "everyone and all members of the human race, including the pious and the sinner, are endowed with dignity, nobility and honor."49 Kamali added that dignity is not earned by "meritorious conduct" but "is an expression of God's favour and grace" and that on that basis "it is not permissible to violate the personal dignity of anyone, regardless of whether the person is pious or of ill-repute, Muslim or non-Muslim."50 This posits that human dignity, rights, and respect for others are irrevocably extended to those who are not adherents of the faith.

In her study of hierarchy in early Islamic society Louise Marlow did suggest that "Islam is probably the most uncompromising of the world's religions in its insistence on the equality of all believers before God."51 Yet she did make the case that despite the Qur'an's advocating that "inequalities have no bearing on an individual's moral worth and ultimate fate in the next world," the Qur'an "endorses several forms of worldly inequality," including its "acceptance of slavery and the social superiority of men over women."52 Marlow does adduce a number of verses that, it is argued, show apparent inconsistencies in the Qur'anic position on equality. For example Q. 43:32: "And that God has raised

<sup>51</sup> Louise Marlow, *Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), xi. Marlow's point from a broader historical perspective is that while the Qur'an advocated a profoundly egalitarian ethic that enjoyed hegemony within the early centuries of Islamic political rule, paradoxically, it was seemingly eclipsed in later political discourses as stratification and the focus on class did become rife in successive historical periods: it dominated the construction of social models.

some over others in terms of rank, so that some may take others in servitude"; and Q. 17:21: "Behold how we favoured some of them over others, and the next world will be greater in degrees and greater in favour." However, a closer reading of these verses reveals that they are not marking rank or hierarchy through favor, but referring to providence and the human condition; in strictly legal terms there is nothing within them that would impinge upon approaches to the legal issues of rights and obligations. Historians of Islamic law tend to point out that "Islam conferred rights on women in the seventh century that women in the West were unable to obtain until relatively recent times" and that "Qur'anic innovations tend in the direction of enhancing women's rights and elevating their status and dignity."53 Still, while such a state of affairs might be considered a milestone from an historical context, the question remains: within the confines of the Qur'anic framework, with its supposed accent on egalitarianism and improvement, to what extent is an "inferior status" accorded to women in Islam, and how can this be reconciled with the modern concept of dignity that is grounded in the idea of equality and the inalienable rights of individuals and their innate worth?54

The historical picture painted by the traditional Islamic sources with regards to the status of women in pre-Islamic Arabia is a dismal one. It has become clichéd to state that the pursuit of reform, amelioration,

and social justice appears to be the principal drivers behind Qur'anic legal injunctions, which are set against the backdrop of countering attitudes deleterious to women prevalent in pre-Islamic society, but a cursory review of most of the Qur'anic legislation on women, and indeed other core social issues, does lend support to that view.55 Examples of amelioration include the condemnation of female infanticide and egregious abuses with regards to marriage, divorce, defamation, and inheritance.56 Still, two interesting issues that are flagged in the discussions about the Qur'an and its attitude to women concern the subject of testimony and inheritance: the Qur'an does stipulate that for the purpose of testimony two male witnesses are required; however, in the event of there being only a single male witness available, then two women may be called upon to bear witness in place of the male (Q. 2:282). On the division of inheritance, the Qur'an rules that a male should receive twice the portion awarded to women (Q. 4:176); and there are also verses that seemingly "elevate" men in terms of responsibilities (Q. 4:34).57

Explanations of the Qur'anic position reason that these distinctions were a reflection of the greater economic responsibility assumed by

Jackson highlights Robert Wuthnow's "problem of articulation" to give context to some of the positions the Qur'an takes on issues such as slavery and women's rights and even the penal code (166).

<sup>56</sup> The Qur'an placed restrictions on polygyny, and stipulated that a dowry should be given directly to the bride instead of its becoming the property of her father; and the practice of a stepson's inheriting his father's spouse was denounced.

Conversely, in Islamic law a Christian or a Jewish spouse of a Muslim is fully entitled to retain her respective faith in the marriage.

men, who were obliged to provide for the spouse and family, while also taking charge of their affairs and needs.58 It is further maintained that the Qur'an's prescriptions were guided by the need to balance a program of reform with the pragmatics of challenging deep-rooted practices and beliefs: and, that idealistically, the Qur'an was committed to essential equality and justice; in addition, the literature of the *ḥadīth*s includes statements such as "The most perfect of believers is he who excels in moral rectitude and the worthiest of you are those who are benevolent to their women," which would appear to complement the idea that it is an egalitarian ethic that serves as the desideratum of scriptural legislation. In the Qur'an due emphasis always appears to be placed on asking its readers to question ethically the appropriateness of one's conduct and attitude toward others, and it is this aspect of exhortation that is frequently embedded in legal discourses. The contention is that pronouncements on mundane matters were never intended to dissipate the spiritual and gender equality that the Qur'an unequivocally endorsed. Indeed, this also leads to the more general contention that although the Qur'an treats women and men differently, it "does not mean that it establishes them as being unequal": others have suggested that the changing dynamic of conditions and circumstance requires that an ethico-legal treatment of text be applied when assessing the Qur'anic pronouncements on women.59 A survey of the various contributions made by women to the social and intellectual life of the

community in classical Islamic societies demonstrates the very active role they played in societies, participating in all spheres of religious and public life.

Recently, in grappling with issues of equality, modern Islamic feminist writers and reformers do remonstrate that the original ethic of Qur'anic teachings was subverted in medieval exegetical and legal discourses through the overbearing influence of patriarchal biases in the form of models and paradigms that were applied in explication of the Qur'an: the suggestion is that the vagaries of vested interests and substrate cultural influences skewed the Qur'an's message of equality. The contention is that the Qur'an does not endorse the inferior status of women, but that such impressions were allowed to prevail because of these biases.60 The corollary to this is that reclaiming the egalitarian ethic espoused by the Qur'an can only be achieved by adopting a holistic approach to the interpretation of verses covering women and their rights and one that is anchored to an appreciation of the text's overall preoccupation with issues of social justice.61 With this in mind, an acute distinction is drawn between legal mandates in the Qur'an and moral ones, with the former being viewed as historically contingent and relevant only to the ancient Arabian context in which they were originally conceived, whereas verses that addressed issues of general morality retained their universal import and efficacy, forming the basis for contemporary ways of interpreting the sources. The claim is that in the context of discussions about conceptions of dignity and equality, gender biases were immaterial and that egalitarianism forms one of the

It was cited by classical jurists to reject the role of women as judges. Most legal schools took this view, although one early tenth-century jurist, al-Ṭabarī, is said to have taken a different position on the matter; and certain Ḥanafī jurists are reported to have taken moderate lines. The argument is that the body of *ḥadīth*s reflects greater patriarchal predispositions, representing a retreat from the egalitarian ethic of the Qur'an.

cornerstones of the Qur'anic ethos in which dignity is unambiguously equated with rights.62 Debating these issues continues to dominate current discourses on reform in Islam.

On the subject of developing new angles from which to broach the concept of dignity, Mohammad Kamali has produced a lengthy disquisition that explores the subject with reference to the classical concept of public interest or (*maṣlaḥa*). Based on theories about the underlying purpose of the law (*maqāṣid*), in terms of safeguarding benefits and averting harm, classical jurists identified five essential values or aims that were deemed central to the idea of public interest, and these included the protection of faith, life, private property, mind, and offspring. Invoking the idea of *maṣlaḥā*, Kamali emphasized that these values were premised on the underlying notion of "the dignity of the human person," which must "be protected as a matter of priority."63 He maintained that on the subject of freedom of expression and the relinquishing of one's faith, support for the right to make personal choices is also to be found in the traditional sources; he states that this is implicitly recognized in the Qur'an, which states: "There is no compulsion in religion" (Q. 2:256).64 The appeal to the notion of *maṣlaḥa* in the

<sup>62</sup> Michael Rosen comments that the Cairo Declaration on Human Rights (1990) makes a distinction between dignity and rights, stating that women have "equal dignity," but not equal rights (Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 89) (outlined in his response to Waldron). Hence, Article 1 states, "All human beings are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations." But on the subject of equality in Article 6 it is stated, "Woman is equal to man in human dignity and has rights to enjoy as well as duties to perform. She has her own civil entity and financial independence, and the right to retain her name and lineage." The need to separate the political and cultural opposition to the UDHR and the Islamic position is stressed by Mayer.

Jurists also developed *qawāʿid fiqhiyya* (legal maxims), a set of universal rules that are derived through a circumspect gauging of the overall objectives of the law. Such maxims, of which there are five principal ones, were used to deal with unprecedented cases not specified in the sources. A second genre was the area of legal stratagems (*ḥiyal*), which strive to yield compliance with the letter of the law if not its spirit.

discourses of reform is not novel: distinguished Muslim reformers such as the Egyptian Muhammad Abduh (d. 1905) advocated a review of the "conventional" approaches across a spectrum of issues, from women's rights to religious pluralism. He cited the classical legal concept of public interest, on the assumption that Islamic law was designed to serve as a viable instrument of social reform and change; its purpose was not to subdue rights and freedoms.65 While with reference to philosophical theology, Abdulaziz Sachedina has propounded the view that Muʿtazilī rational moral theory combined with an ethical approach to law has the potential to yield a framework for expressions of human dignity and autonomy that demonstrate a distinct compatibility with western liberal views on human individuality and dignity as enshrined within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.66 He makes the point that the tendency to point to supposed tensions between Islamic thought and the ideals that underpin the UDHR seemingly stems from contrived attempts to present the Islamic position as being monolithic. He links this to a crisis of epistemology in current Islamic thought, arguing that the state of affairs is detrimental because impressions of the classical Islamic position on dignity are frequently informed in academic circles by reference to modern apologetic and retrograde treatments of the subject that fail to grasp the richness of the original sources or use the appropriate ethical tools of analysis when gauging the textual sources.67 The apposite point has been made that often political and cultural exigencies were driving opposition toward aspects of the UDHR by certain Arab and Islamic countries, and it is alleged that alternative Islamic

## Conclusions

It has been mooted that the "the genuine greatness in the achievements of classical Islamic civilization" is reflected in its ability to integrate and cultivate systems of thought with which it came into contact.69 Significantly, the traditional scriptural sources also played a critical role in creating the environment for such processes to flourish. The rich range of discussions and perspectives relevant to the concept of dignity in classical Islamic thought underpins the efficacy of this arrangement. Previously, academic surveys of the concept of dignity in Islamic discourses have underestimated not only the true scale and potential of the Islamic materials, but also the rich tapestry of integrated formats through which ideas germane to morality and innate worth were articulated and applied in legal, theological, and ethical discussions. Certainly, the increasing number of scholarship and studies devoted to exploring Islamic notions of dignity and related areas of ethics will help to nurture a better understanding of the richness of the materials on the subject and draw welcome attention to their intellectual and practical merits.

## Manetti, Not Pico

In 1486 Giovanni Pico della Mirandola wrote a speech widely (though wrongly) seen as the leading statement of its day about human dignity. A striking feature of the speech is dislike of the body—"a noose round the neck of the soul." Several decades earlier, Giannozzo Manetti had written a longer work, also in Latin, that often mentions *dignitas* while treating the body in a strikingly different way. The body is "an amazingly elegant dwelling for the human soul" that proves mankind's superiority because the human frame is "worthier" (*dignior*) than any other animal's. Manetti also admired the human skill and spirit that he saw displayed in the magnificent art of his hometown—Florence. While never attributing *dignitas* to anything artificial, he shows how art dazzles him as a distinctively human achievement: art is "energetic,"

"outstanding," and "astonishing." As for Manetti's own achievement, I will show how remarkable it was in its own cultural and moral setting—especially by contrast to Pico's revulsion for the body.

## Kant's Dignity and Adam's

In the third *Critique*, speaking of fine art, Immanuel Kant concludes this about its products, which often are inert, lifeless things: a work of art "must in itself always show some dignity (*Würde*)." Some years before, however, in a famous passage of the *Groundwork*, the same philosopher had ruled that possibility out by restricting dignity to humans and the moral law. In the kingdom of ends where humans act rationally—as when they evaluate works of art—"everything has either a price (*Preis*) or a dignity." Things with prices have equivalents that can replace them, whereas dignity belongs to what is beyond price and has no equivalent. The absolutely incomparable and utterly irreplaceable ceiling of the Sistine Chapel (See Fig. 5.1), perhaps?2

Price and dignity are types of value (*Wert*). Price, whether calculated by needs in a market or driven by whims in a carnival of delight, is relative value. Dignity is intrinsic value, possessed only by "morality and by humanity insofar as it is morally capable"—morality enforced by a system of laws, legislated by humans. Outside the kingdom of ends, both nature and art are effective, producing things whose value is relative. Within the kingdom of ends, however, the salient item is no thing at all but "a mentality recognized as dignity, … an unconditional, incomparable value."3

<sup>2</sup> Drama and music are not lifeless in performance, of course, like scores and scripts. I cite Kant's text in the Suhrkamp series, using or adapting the English of the Guyer and Wood edition: *Kritik der Urteilskraft*, ed. W. Weischedel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1974), 277; *Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten*, ed. W. Weischedel (Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 1974), 68–69; *Critique of the Power of Judgment*, ed. and trans. P. Guyer and E. Matthews (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), 212; *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*, in *Practical Philosophy*, ed. and trans. M. Gregor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), 84–85.

<sup>3</sup> Kant, *Grundlegung*, 68–69; *Groundwork*, 84–85.

How to bring this item into focus? One index is the respect that each rational being owes to every other, according to the *Metaphysics of Morals*: "not merely as a means to ends, … but as an end in itself, … he possesses a dignity (an absolute inner value)." Hence, "a human being regarded as a person … is raised above any price … and possesses an inalienable dignity (*dignitas interna*)." It is this inner dignity that commands from other persons the respect that no one may forfeit respect not just for "a person generally but as a human." Such a person has "duties that his own reason lays upon him," by the self-legislating that constitutes both human personhood and dignity, so that the one always comes with the other, inseparably.4

If so, if dignity is inalienable, why should Kant warn against *forfeiting* respect? Why is self-esteem a duty, since duties can go *undone*? Why worry about the servility that *disavows* dignity or the ambition that seeks "an even greater inner value"? Perhaps respect, servility, and ambition are all relational—relating persons to things or each other by attitude or desire—and perhaps self-esteem is reflexive, turning the relation of respect back on the self, whereas dignity is not reflexive or relational, but constitutive (in part) of the human person. Perhaps "greater inner value" is incoherent since any measure of increase must be by a standard, relating the unrelatable. The questions are hard, and Kant does not settle them all.5

He says that the moral law itself has dignity, as do humans as its legislators. But laws on the books are made by humans, not the reverse. Laws, rules, maxims, and other such items would seem to get their dignity from the humans who enact them. Dignity belongs to persons, not to things, natural or artificial, whose values are relative, not entirely their own. Impersonal things lack the absolute, unconditional, incomparable value that belongs—and belongs inalienably—to each human

person. But a work of art needs to show some dignity. So what might Kant mean?

A work of artifice or art is an artificial thing—not a person. In some sense, practical or poetic, Michelangelo's ceiling may be incomparably valuable, but the value cannot be absolute. Tastes may change and horrify us all. The Vatican might sell the Chapel and its ceiling. The unthinkable commerce, as such, would violate no person's dignity: Adam, God, and the rest of that lofty crowd are not persons just pictures of persons. Pictures can be bought and sold.

Perhaps the subtle economy of value, price, and dignity can bear some strain, however: if a work of art—Adam naked on the ceiling— "must in itself always show some dignity," maybe Kant equivocates a bit about 'dignity' or is more intent on the showing (*zeigen*) of it. The lifeless image just seems to have that feature because it seems alive on the ceiling. The painted Adam can "show some dignity" because it looks like a human person.6

## Pico's Dignity

Kant connected *Würde*, his word for dignity, with *dignitas* in Latin. Wilhelm Tennemann did the same when he adapted Jacob Brucker's earlier history of philosophy to Kant's new ideas and terminology, in order to explicate a much older speech, called the *Oratio de hominis dignitate*—though not called that by its author, Pico. Written in 1486, the *Oration* was not yet as famous as Pico when Tennemann noticed it. He and other historians put the speech on its path to fame, but only at the end of the Enlightenment.7

<sup>7</sup> For Tennemann on Pico, much more positive than Brucker, see Copenhaver, "Magic and the Dignity of Man," in *The Italian Renaissance in the Twentieth Century: Acts of an International Conference in Florence, Villa I Tatti, June 9–11, 1999*, ed. A. Grieco et al. (Florence: Villa I Tatti, 2002), 295–320; on the missing title and circumstances of publication, see Bausi's introduction in Pico, *Discorso sulla dignità dell'uomo*, ed. and trans. F. Bausi (Parma: Guanda, 2003), xi, and for details Copenhaver, "Giovanni Pico della Mirandola," *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* (Fall 2016 ed.), ed. Edward N. Zalta.

Pico had planned the *Oration* to introduce an overblown event that never happened, severely damaging his reputation. Meant to dazzle the College of Cardinals, the speech introduces a longer text—900 philosophical theses, some in paradoxical form—that provoked papal condemnation, forcing Pico to run away to France. Had the young prince not been so well connected, the calamity might have been fatal. He survived but never published the *Oration* and seems to have been embarrassed by it. In any case, because the speech relies on coded Jewish secrets, the intended audience of Christian dignitaries could never have grasped what it says—that humans must escape the body and turn into angels, using magic and Kabbalah.8

Much later, the *Oration* would entrance students and their teachers in North America. After World War II, as colleges rapidly expanded, they needed textbooks for courses on 'western civilization.' One was a book of readings published in 1948, a key year for Pico's story: called *The Renaissance Philosophy of Man* and still in print, it includes an English version of the speech—rarely translated before the twentieth century. *The Western Heritage* (1979), a textbook typical of its time, reprints a few lines. In them Pico imagines God clarifying the terms of creation for Adam: "To him it is granted to have whatever he chooses, to be whatever he wills." A boxed headline introduces the passage:

## Pico della Mirandola States the Renaissance Image of Man

One of the most eloquent descriptions of the Renaissance image of man comes from the Italian humanist Pico della Mirandola (1463–1494). In his famed *Oration on the Dignity of Man* (c. 1486) Pico describes man as free to become whatever he chooses.

In the next (1983) edition of *The Western Heritage,* Pico's topic becomes "the Renaissance image of *mankind*," and what he describes is "*humans* as free to become whatever *they* choose." In the 1995 edition, "mankind" has evolved again into "human beings," and the updated praise of humanity has provoked interrogation. "How great, really, is the choice outlined here," we are asked. "Is the concept of freedom in this passage a modern one?"9

In 1999, another book—*Western Civilization: A Brief History* displayed the same part of the *Oration* in the same way, with Pico proclaiming "the unlimited potentiality of human beings." By the end of the last century, the speech had become a meme. Pico was now a fixture in textbooks meant to explain world history or western civilization or the Renaissance to college students. Praise for him was abundant, expressed in a flamboyant vocabulary: "bold," "exuberant," "striking," "dazzling," "brilliant," "gargantuan," "remarkable," "renowned," "outstanding." His *Oration* is "immortal," the "most famous Renaissance statement on the nature of man," and the "supreme statement of the Renaissance idolization of man."10

Ever since Tennemann, however, few readers of Pico's speech had read far enough. His exordium, a short blast of studied rhetoric, does indeed rewrite the biblical script for God, permitting Adam "to have what he chooses, to be what he wants." What the first human *ought* to choose, however, is not at all human—a lesson that comes after the opening of the speech.11

Pico's eventual advice is nothing like the usual textbook accounts of the *Oration*; only an extended selection can show the difference:

Let us climb for the heights, panting; and let us strive with all our might to reach them—since we can do it if we will it. Let us scorn the things of earth, let us despise those of heaven, and then, leaving behind whatever belongs to the world, let us fly up to the hypercosmic court nearest the most exalted divinity, where … seraphim, cherubim, and thrones have the first places. Since we cannot abide second place and cannot yield to them, let us be their rivals for rank (*dignitas*) and glory…. We are to form our lives on the model of the cherubic life…. Because we are flesh and smell of the earth, however, we cannot attain this on our own, so let us go to the ancient fathers…. Emulating the cherubic life on earth, … let us consult the patriarch Jacob…. He will use a figure, … a ladder reaching from earth below to the sky above, … with the Lord seated at the top, while back and forth the angels of contemplation "move up and down the ladder." But if we are to do the same as we aspire to the angelic life, who—I ask—will touch the Lord's ladder with dirty feet or hands unclean?

<sup>11</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 12.

"For the impure to touch the pure is sacrilege," as the mysteries teach…. These hands, these feet—the whole sensual part where the lure of the body "hangs, as they say, like a noose round the neck of the soul"—let us wash them … , lest we be turned away from the ladder, desecrated and defiled…. Then, animated by the cherubic spirit, … resting at the top of the ladder in the bosom of the Father, we shall at last be consumed in theological bliss…. We will enjoy to the full the peace that we have longed for—the holiest peace, the unbreakable bond, the friendship of the single-souled wherein all our spirits do not so much converge in the one mind that is above every mind as in some unsayable way emerge as absolutely one. This is the friendship that the Pythagoreans say is the end of all philosophy. This is the peace that God "makes on high," which angels descending to earth have announced "to men of goodwill" so that through it these same men, ascending to heaven, might be made into angels.12

Pico wants humans to become angels, and the rest of the *Oration* tells them how. The speech is an exhortation to do angel magic, using Kabbalist techniques of ecstatic transformation to become "absolutely one" with God, thus consuming the self "in theological bliss." Scriptural quotations punctuating the speech are clues for the few who could see them for what they are—allusions to texts of Kabbalah that no Christians of Pico's day could possibly understand. Writing so learnedly at the age of twenty-three about material so arcane, the young prince was full of himself—blind to the arrogance that kept readers of the *Oration* baffled for five centuries, until just a few decades ago. Certainly Tennemann was in no position to understand what Pico was talking about.13

What the speech says about *dignitas* is easy to see, however, since the word comes up only twice. When Pico first uses it—in the passage just cited—*dignitas* is paired with *gloria* as a prize held by angels,

<sup>12</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 22–42.

<sup>13</sup> Wirszubski, *Encounter*; Copenhaver, "Secret of Pico's *Oration*"; Copenhaver, "Maimonides, Abulafia and Pico."

not humans. It denotes angelic *rank*, higher than human but nonetheless comparable, while connoting other senses of this slippery word. *Dignitas* in its second use describes the philosophical preparation that precedes the esoteric part of his curriculum. The pairing here of *dignitas* with *emolumenta* ("advantages") also makes this instance of the word, denoting the *value* of philosophy, a comparative and relative term. In neither case does *dignitas* belong to humans, except aspirationally, and neither justifies 'dignity' as a translation, with all the Kantian baggage of the modern English word. As for the speech as a whole, Pico never bothered to give it a title. *Oration on the Dignity of Man* has stuck, however, once an early editor jumped to conclusions from a glance at the first few pages.14

This was the title known to Tennemann, who misread the speech in the same way—at least the first few paragraphs that seemed readable. Turning the *Oration*'s ideas into German, he had many more options than *Würde*, however. Perhaps he remembered where the *Metaphysics of Morals* links *Würde* with *dignitas*—or perhaps not. One dictionary available to him since 1779, Scheller's *Complete Latin-German Lexicon*, gives these choices in addition to *Würde*:

| Ansehen | reputation |
| --- | --- |
| Anstand | decency |
| Ehrbarkeit | integrity |
| Ehre | prestige |
| Ehrenstelle | post of honor |
| Schicklichkeit | propriety |
| Schönheit | beauty |
| Stand | rank |
| Tugend | virtue |
| Verdienst | merit |
| Werth | value |
| Wohlstand | prosperity |
| Würde | dignity |
| Würdigkeit | worthiness |

<sup>14</sup> Pico, *Discorso*, 22; note 7 in this chapter.

Some of the German words overlap, and each has its own wider range, reflecting the breadth and complexity in classical Latin of *dignitas*, whose meaning varied with context and over time. A later work completed in 1845, Freund's *Dictionary of the Latin Language*, is tidier than Scheller's *Lexicon*, classifying senses of *dignitas* in three groups: "original," "by metonymy of cause for effect," and "figurative." The basic meanings are rare, says Freund, perhaps found only in Cicero: "worth (*Würdigsein*), worthiness (*Würdigkeit*), and merit." Metonymies are frequent: "the dignity (*Würde*), reputation, respect or high standing that arises from the physical or moral features of a person or the state." The word also applies "figuratively to physical objects for value, dignity (*Würde*) or distinction."15

Tennemann had many options, then. But only two—*Wert* and *Würde*—would insert Pico's *dignitas*, alongside *Preis*, into Kant's elegant moral calculus. For Pico's fame and the celebrity of his *Oration*, the choice of *Würde* was decisive. Yet nothing calls for it in the speech that Pico wrote, which reveals little of the author's thinking about *dignitas*.

Nonetheless, appeals to Pico's missing account of dignity are commonplace (not to say habitual and formulaic) in the contemporary literature on the subject. There, as in writings of the previous two centuries, the full-blown notion is sometimes "human freedom and dignity," whose nexus is taken to be characteristic of modernity. The modern world itself, by other widespread accounts, was also the invention of Pico's era, the 'Renaissance,' as described most powerfully by Jacob Burckhardt and more gracefully by Walter Pater: Pico's speech and Adam's body (See Fig. 5.2) are moments of modernity for Pater.16

"This high dignity of man" is Pater's phrase—making too much, as usual, of the *Oration*'s mistaken title. The word 'dignity' itself, without reference to the speech's conflicting content, signaled to him "a counterpoise to the increasing tendency of medieval religion to depreciate man's nature, … to make it ashamed of itself…. It helped man onward to that … rehabilitation of human nature, the body, the senses, the heart, the intelligence, which the Renaissance fulfills." Likewise, but on far better evidence of the eyes, Michelangelo's genius was

to concern itself almost exclusively with the making of man, … the first and unique act, the creation of life itself in its supreme form…. Fair as the young men of the Elgin marbles, the Adam of the Sistine Chapel is unlike them…. In that languid figure there is something rude and satyr-like…. His whole form is gathered into an expression of mere expectancy and reception; he has hardly strength enough to lift his finger to touch the finger of the creator; yet a touch of the finger-tips will suffice.

And so it did suffice. This huge, dreamy, muscle-bound Bacchus has, within himself, what it takes to make the heavenly connection and become a god on earth. The Creator floats above Adam, but a creature steals the show. Almighty God, with a crowd stirring under his cloak, is more than just scenery, but not much more. One might ask

just who is made in whose likeness. Rehabilitation is no longer the issue for Adam's nature, mind, heart, senses, or body. The high dignity of man exhibits itself in them—up there, on display in Adam's nakedness.17

Since Kant thought that a work of art must show some dignity, could he allow as much about this painted Adam, a picture of the first human, while confining dignity to mankind and the moral law? Perhaps he could find a way, true to his own words about art and dignity. But what about Pico and his angel magic—those "symbols of the Jewish ritual," as Pater called them?18

Kant mentions Pico only once, as "one of the prodigies of memory … who carry around in their heads … a load of books for a hundred camels … [and] perhaps lacked the … judgment suitable for choosing." The camels suggest the many stories about the young prince who knew everything, but there are no complaints about magic or Kabbalah. Yet Kant might have agreed with another enlightened sage, Voltaire, who eviscerated Pico for "benighted erudition," "unintelligible words," and "alarming lunacy" in "a vast pit of error." Kant knew where to put such craziness, with the "rapture (*Schwärmerei*) that deludes itself by hoping to see beyond all limits of sense, a dreaming by principles or raving with reason."19

In any case, neither the *Oration* nor what it introduces has any bearing on Kant's theory of dignity, despite Tennemann's views on Pico's *dignitas* as *Würde*. But Kant's theory of *Würde* is the root of modern conceptions of dignity, whose outstanding official expression is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights made by the General Assembly of the United Nations in 1948. The Declaration recognizes dignity as inherent in "all members of the human family" and links it

with "inalienable rights" as "the foundation of freedom." If Pico were really the author of a text that anticipates this conception of human dignity, he would deserve our attention and admiration as an architect of modernity. But he wrote nothing like it.20

## Manetti's Dignity I

So should we skip Pico's era, the Renaissance, as we track dignity through the ages? Not yet, because other texts from the same period say more about *dignitas*. One is Manetti's longer work *On the Dignity and Excellence of Man*. 21

The book's circumstances reveal its intent: it emulates an earlier, shorter work, *On Man's Excellence and Superiority*, written in the late 1440s by Bartolomeo Facio and dedicated to Nicholas V, who became pope in 1447. Facio had been Genoa's ambassador to Alfonso V of Aragon, the king of Naples, who supported a large clientele of scholars, Facio among them, but also Manetti, who would already have met Facio when he represented Florence in Genoa, then again later when Florence sent him to Naples in 1443 and to Rome when Nicholas was elected. The new pontiff knew Manetti well; they had studied together in Florence. And the Florentine had already seen Facio's book in Naples, describing it to Alfonso, in his fulsome way, as "excellent, outstanding, worth remembering and deserving much praise besides." If a

<sup>21</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate*, is the standard edition, edited by Elizabeth Leonard. For Manetti's life and works, see Simona Foà, "Manetti Gianozzo," *Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani*, http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giannozzo-manetti; Charles Trinkaus, *In Our Image and Likeness: Humanity and Divinity in Italian Humanist Thought* (London: Constable, 1970), 1.230–58. Since *dignitas* is not always well rendered by 'dignity,' I often use the Latin word instead of the English.

pope had so fine a book, a king should have one too: so Manetti wrote another on the same subject.22

He finished in 1450 or 1451, when he was back in Tuscany. The book is larger than Facio's and painfully well organized, as if by someone who has just discovered topic sentences. On the concept of dignity, however, there is not much to choose between the two. This is strange, since one of them, Manetti's, is the only finished piece of Latin prose from the period on *dignitas* that declares itself to be so—except for Pico's mistitled speech. If, from an age renowned for 'humanism,' Manetti's is the most prominent account of *dignitas* whose title actually claims that role, one might expect more of it.

A respected survey of the canonical texts includes Manetti's but credits Petrarch with "the first explicit treatment of the theme of the 'dignity of man.'" Petrarch's subject was larger, however— *Remedies for Both Kinds of Fortune*, where *dignitas* comes up briefly in a chapter titled "Sadness and Misery," sandwiched between toothache and the plague. Nearly ninety years passed before Friar Antonio da Barga tested the same theme in a sketch, *On Human Dignity*, prompting Facio—Antonio's student—and perhaps Manetti to enter the conversation. Then Poggio Bracciolini turned the tables in 1455 with *Two Books on the Misery of the Human Condition*. Giovanni Garzoni also wrote a work called *On Human Misery*, while *Human Happiness* was Benedetto Morandi's topic. After Platina (Bartolommeo de' Sacchi) discussed the topics in his title, *The True and False Good*, in the 1470s, Aurelio Brandolini, his student, followed with a *Dialogue on the State of Human Life and the Need to Bear the Body's Ills*. 23

All in all, illness and misery did as well as health and happiness in this period, and *dignitas* was on nobody's marquee—except Manetti's. But making too much of titles in the Quattrocento would be a mistake; manuscript publication, unstable in such matters, was the norm until late in the century. Still, in the tale of dignity, much has been made of a title that Pico never gave his speech, where *dignitas* occurs just twice and the human type never. Manetti's book, whatever its flaws, has at least the virtue of using the Latin word often—more than ten times as often as Pico.24

Writing about human excellence presented many occasions for mentioning *dignitas*. Perhaps too many: the book is egregiously overwritten. Every paragraph comes fully padded. Explicit outlining and signposting are relentless. No rhetorical figure of repetition goes unrepeated: commoratio, hendiatris, synathroesmus, synonymia, and tautology are staples for Manetti. Pleonasms are everywhere, as in his nod to Facio's shorter effort: "excellent, outstanding, worth remembering and deserving much praise besides." Besides? For this way of writing, duplication, triplication, and beyond are elements of style: Strunk and White would have baffled Manetti. But carping at bloated writing in a dead language would have little point were the wordiness not a remedy—possibly—for vagueness on the nature of dignity.25

When Kant claims that dignity cannot be taken from any human and cannot be priced, he gives reasons for what he thinks. From his reasoning, a definition can be derived: according to one expert, Kant's dignity is "the absolute, hence equal, worth of all rational beings." But Manetti's way is not to state a definition or justify its elements; he keeps talking about *dignitas* without ever saying what it is. How can we find

out? Pleonasms may help, as in the title of his book: *On the Dignity and Excellence of Man*. After a few pages, anyone can see that this pairing of *dignitas* with *excellentia* is nothing unusual. It's a formula, a habit, a tic in Manetti's Latin.26

In the first lines of the book, in a space of 200 words, I count nine pleonasms, involving 29 words. Later, other pairings pop up everywhere, like *plane et aperte* (plainly and clearly), used three dozen times. Dreary repetition shows this coupling to be empty: the second partner never changes anything about the first—no gain, no loss. This is not always so, however. Consider *certa ac vera* (certain and true). As presented, this marriage is also childless, though it might be otherwise: truth and certainty are not the same, after all. Or take *animum mentemque* (spirit and mind). As Manetti notes, experts could not decide whether an *animus* was always an *anima*, sometimes reserving the latter for 'soul,' the former for 'mind.' Glossing *animus* with *mens* might be informative, then. Suppose this were so for the *dignitate et excellentia* in Manetti's title: he would be informing us about *dignitas* by pairing it with *excellentia*. Wordiness about *dignitas* may help us learn what he thought about it.27

That little bit of rhetoric and philology is purely lexical, but it bears on philosophy. Another side of philology, the study of ancient texts, does the same. Manetti wrote and spoke Latin fluently, but it was not his maternal language. Much of his vocabulary came from the old texts, whose recovery from medieval oblivion was momentous for him and his peers. In reality, many Latin classics had never dropped out of sight during the

The first few cases of *plane et aperte* are at 1.44, 54; 2.10, 12, 15—and then on and on, sometimes with *clare et aperte* as a variant. The *animus/anima* question comes up at 2.3.

Middle Ages: almost all that survived had been copied during that time. Nonetheless, when Petrarch found books by Cicero and Livy that had long gone unread, the shock of the new was electric, inspiring scholars like Manetti to revere the ancient texts, study them closely, and even learn them by heart. If Cicero had much to say about *dignitas*, Manetti would have known it.

## Cicero's Dignity

Cicero said a great deal—over a thousand uses of *dignitas*, half the total for classical Latin. In his lifetime, when the Republic collapsed, the politics of a crumbling state shaped the word. Because he used it so often to make political points, and because he was a lord of Latinity for people like Manetti, Cicero's usage—political and opportunist at its core—was the textual center of gravity for Manetti's *dignitas*. Cicero does not always use it in the same way, of course—not opportune for a politician. His speeches show us *dignitas* in practice. For theory we have essays on oratory as well as philosophical writings. His many letters shed light on all facets of the word.28

In 63 bce, Cicero was elected consul, but within a few years Rome's ferocious politics forced him into exile. In 57, events turned in his favor

and he returned to Rome, only to see his career implode. Before that humiliation, he spoke on behalf of an ally, Lucius Publius Sestius, and he got him off, presenting Sestius as a hero who would give his life for Rome—"a state with such resources, an empire of such *dignitas*."29

To get the judges on his client's side, Cicero insists that they, just like Sestius, are 'good' people (*boni*)—the very best (*optimi*), in fact. But Sestius had been framed by the faction called 'popular' (*populares*). Their opponents, including Cicero, were the *optimates*. Cicero broadens his base, however, arguing that his party is not an aristocratic clique: "all are optimates who are not criminals or perverts by nature or insane." He casts a wide net but quickly pulls it tight: the best people must also be "well off in domestic circumstances." Only those with wealth and property can afford the civic engagement that he takes for granted.

What do Cicero and the optimates want? "Peace with dignity"—in one standard translation, or "ease conjoined with duty" or "easy dignity." The Latin is *cum dignitate otium*, and it has puzzled the experts, who worry mainly about *otium*. If *dignitas* is 'easy,' for example, *otium* is *sprezzatura*, too nonchalant for earnest judges. 'Leisure' might be attractive, but could they afford it, and might it not be decadent? More seemly would be 'tranquility,' suggesting *ataraxia*, a moral ideal of the Greek sages whom Cicero followed.30

Under any description of *otium, dignitas* is the desired complement, but not just any *otium* will do, nor just any *dignitas*: "It befits no one," Cicero warns, "to be so transported by the *dignitas* of public deeds as to pay no mind to tranquility." Civic duty is done best by a sage capable of serenity: that was Cicero's ideal. He was a politician, however, and in that practical employment *cum dignitate otium* was a slogan, like "morning again in America" or "compassionate conservatism."31

Cicero's rivals eventually drove him out of Rome. Reflecting on those troubles, he says that exile deprived him of his "former *dignitas*" but that returning from the wilderness restored it. *Dignitas* comes and goes. The realpolitik of Cicero's responses to his dicey world is stunning. Reviewing his career, he concluded that

always sticking with a single position has never won praise for leaders who govern the state…. Although all of us—as I have said so often—should always aim at *dignitas* with tranquility, our obligation is to keep our goal the same, not to say the same thing.

No matter what, *otium* and *dignitas* need one another, whatever they happen to be called. Versatility in speech was a skill of Cicero's trade. An orator needs a moral compass, however, requiring good character, not just clever language. Accordingly, "Nothing is more desirable than *dignitas*" when speaking in public. And talk about virtue always sells. Wisdom, for example, will appeal to an audience as a shield against misfortune, a way to "hold on to *dignitas* when things get rough."32

A good man gets credit for not being broken by adversity and thus maintaining his stature, which Cicero—by his own account—could not manage. Perhaps what comes and goes is tied to office or current affairs, a contingency of status, while a different *dignitas* is a character trait that survives bad times, or even prospers. In light of that distinction, Cicero must have yet another *dignitas* in mind when he describes the fifth part of rhetoric, the delivery of a speech, as needing both *dignitas* and *venustas*. Just as *dignitas* goes with *otium* in politics, in rhetoric—and wherever aesthetic judgments apply—its companion is *venustas*. 33

When speech is art, the speaker pleases and persuades by choosing among elements of style. But the skilled orator knows that nature

is the mother of art: she has arranged things—items in the world reflected by items of language—so that "what has the most usefulness (*utilitas*) in it is the same thing that has the most dignity (*dignitas*) and often beauty (*venustas*) as well." This decorous *utilitas* is not expedient, and the associated *dignitas* is not dissolved by convenient choices. Moreover, the *venustas* linked with oratorical *dignitas* is no trivial beauty: we see it in the heavens, the human body, and in great works of art and artifice.34

Such monuments have grace (*decorum*), like the fitness of a temple whose parts fit one another and which fits the place where it stands. The columns holding the temple up are useful, and the pediment above is no mere decoration: "The temple's *dignitas* results from the *utilitas* of its pediment." Private houses also have such qualities. Cicero had thought about them, having lost his own house on the Palatine to exile. Another house on the same hill is "full of *dignitas*," a political asset for the owner: "In fact, *dignitas* can be supplied by a house, though not wholly obtained from it." The *dignitas* that can be had from a building can also be watched in a face, a body, a posture and gestures—all tools of the orator. Cicero has much to say about this bodily *dignitas* in his most important statement of moral theory, *On Duties*, which pairs it with *venustas*. The two are "types of beauty." *Dignitas* is male beauty, *venustas* is female: grace, charm, elegance, loveliness, comeliness.35

Cicero is not thinking just about inner beauty. The *dignitas* that goes with *venustas* as a feature of bodies and buildings is on display. He analyzes it by Romanizing Stoic ethics, starting with *kathēkon* or 'appropriate action.' He Latinized the Greek word as *officium* or 'duty,' a narrower term in his language. He also takes a novel approach to the usual four virtues. Instead of the elusive *sophrosunē*—often

'temperance,' though hard to render—his fourth is *to prepon* or *decorum* in Latin, what is seemly or fitting.36

The fit can be abstract, like *dignus*, a cousin of *dignitas. Dignus* is an adjective, 'worth' or 'worthy,' as in this noncommittal disjunction: 'worth seeking' or 'worth avoiding,' where for *any* content, one phrase cancels the other. Latin words of this family connote what can be judged aesthetically. Experts on etymology trace *decorum, dignitas*, and *dignus* to *decet*, an impersonal verb that glides from aesthetic to moral values when something 'is becoming.' If a thing 'is comely' another sense of *decet*—it has a body. Not if it 'is seemly,' however, and not necessarily if it 'is becoming.'37

It becomes a good person to follow nature. The sage who does his natural duty will realize "how far human nature surpasses the cattle and other animals who feel nothing but pleasure, … whereas the human mind feeds on learning and thinking, … directed by the delight of seeing and hearing." When people lapse into sensuality, they are ashamed, showing that "the body's pleasure does not really befit mankind's superiority…. If we choose to consider what excellence and *dignitas* there is in our nature, we will understand how disgraceful it is to ooze away in dissipation."38

This passage from Cicero's study of duties has been called "the earliest evidence in Latin for the dignity of human nature," and maybe it is.39 Nonetheless, his *dignitas* is a many-splendored thing, sometimes as banal as the lyrics of a pop song. In high-minded tones, Marcus the philosopher theorized about it, but theory never hobbled Tully the politician, who used the word just as he pleased. Cheapened by Roman politics, *dignitas* still always expressed value, but its core was

pragmatic and political, with allowances for social, moral, rhetorical, and aesthetic needs. Status, office, rank, and socioeconomic resources were often in play. The values in question were usually human, belonging to a single person. But groups of humans (the state, an audience) as well as nonhuman things (the universe, a building, a speech) could also have *dignitas*, whether they were natural (a tree) or artificial (a temple).

When the judgments were aesthetic, not all humans could have *dignitas*, however, which in that case was gendered: a handsome man's *dignitas* is *venustas* in a woman. When the stakes were political, male *dignitas* required *otium*, excluding all women and children and most men too—all the enslaved and almost all others, who, even if they were citizens, could not afford the civic involvement that Cicero expected. The few free adult males who could pay the price for *dignitas* might lose it and then regain it: it was transitory, circumstantial, and not inalienable. Its features are hard to pin down: external or internal, visible or invisible, material or immaterial, physical or psychological, bodily or nonbodily? It depends on the situation.

## Christian Dignity

Did a sordid past in Roman politics take *dignitas* off the table for some early Christians who spoke Latin? That might help explain why the word never occurs in the Latin New Testament, which uses many words like it—abstract nouns ending in -*itas*—especially for theological purposes in the Epistles. Besides 'love' (*caritas*) and 'truth' (*veritas*), which are everywhere, many other such abstractions entered the Holy Writ that bypassed *dignitas*: the new Christian *utilitas*, for example, is the kind that Cicero discussed, though the *tranquillitas* in the Gospels is good weather, not moral poise.40

<sup>40</sup> In the NT Vulg., see 1 Tim. 6:10 for 'avarice' (*cupiditas*); Eph. 5:4 for 'buffoonery' (*scurrilitas*); Mark 4:39 'calm' (*tranquillitas*); Rom. 1:20 'divinity' (*divinitas*); 2 Cor. 8:14 'equality' (*aequalitas*); 2 Cor. 4:7 'excellence' (*sublimitas*); Gal. 5:22 'forbearance' (*longanimitas*); Luke 2:9 'glory' (*claritas*); Rom. 2:4 'goodness' (*benignitas*); John 11:4 'illness' (*infirmitas*); Matt. 24:12 'iniquity' (*iniquitas*); Rom. 3:3 'unbelief ' (*incredulitas*); Rom. 3:16 'unhappiness' (*infelicitas*); Rom. 3:1 'usefulness' (*utilitas*).

In the Bible's distinctly Christian part, *dignitas* has no pedigree at all, and very little in the older books: of thirteen uses there, six are in apocryphal writings. Since scripture is nearly a blank slate for *dignitas*, the first Christians could make of it what they would. That something would be made of it was likely, since the word was so common in Latin. And because Christianity is a bookish religion, the Bible was bound to play a large role—despite its reticence.41

The holy book alone, in fact, since it framed all Christian experience, would make Christian *dignitas* different from the pagan kind known to Cicero. A few words (not including *dignitas*) from the opening of the Bible were especially productive: "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." That passage from Genesis 1:26 inspired this early medieval meditation—probably by Alcuin around the year 800:  

We recognize the *dignitas* of the human condition to be so great that man was created not only by the words of the one giving the orders—like the works of the other six days—but by the will of the blessed Trinity and by an act of divine lordliness, so that man would understand from the honor of his original condition how much he owes his Creator, in keeping with the privilege that the Creator bestowed on him in his original state of *dignitas*…. Also, there is another trinity in man's soul, which was created in the image of its Creator—the supreme and perfect Trinity, in fact, which is in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And while the soul has a single nature, yet it has three *dignitates* in it: intellect, will and memory, … not three souls in one body, but a single soul having three *dignitates*. In those three, our inner person miraculously carries God's image in his

<sup>41</sup> OT Vulg. Passages with *dignitas* are Esth. 9:3, 10:2; Ezek. 24:25; Prov. 14:28, 16:31, 20:29; Eccles. 10:6; Ecclus. 44:3, 45:30; Bar. 4:3; 1 Mac. 10:24, 55; 3 Ezra 8:3.

own nature, and from them—as if from the soul's more outstanding *dignitates*—we are commanded to love the Creator….

What greater honor could a human have than to be created in the likeness of his maker? … Or what could disgrace a person more, what unhappiness could be more miserable, than to lose the glory of his Creator's likeness and sink into ugliness and absence of reason, the likeness of brute beasts? … Hence, whoever takes careful note of the excellence (*excellentia*) of his original condition and recognizes in himself the venerable image (*imago*) of the blessed Trinity, let him strive—by better behavior, by practicing the virtues, by the *dignitas* that comes with merit—also to have the honor (*honor*) of the divine likeness (*similitudo*) in which he has been created, so that when this appears as it is, he may appear like the one who by a miracle created him, in the first Adam, in his own likeness, and then, in the second Adam, gave him new form by a greater miracle.42

Since there is nothing political here and only a little morality, the author has come a long way from Cicero. He comments on a string of Bible verses, starting with Genesis. Humans, endowed with the primal excellence that mirrors the Creator's *image*, can also win the *dignitas* that "comes with merit," gaining the honor of the divine *likeness* by virtuous behavior: *excellentia* is inborn, but *honor* is earned by the *dignitas* of meritorious conduct. Honor has its counterpoint in disgrace, however—the price of forgetting the divine likeness and reverting to beastly ugliness. Humans can lose their resemblance to God. To avoid that shame, they must constantly imitate the Creator who gave them his own image.

But God in this persona (as distinct from Christ) is bodiless and invisible. How can embodied humans have a bodiless Creator's

<sup>42 <</sup>i>Dicta Albini de imagine Dei, in John Marenbon, *From the Circle of Alcuin to the School of Auxerre: Logic and Philosophy in the Early Middle Ages* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), 33, 43, 158–61: as Marenbon explains, Albinus was Alcuin's nickname.

likeness? The answer lies in the parts or powers or faculties of the soul. According to Augustine, the human soul has many tripartitions. One of them is intellect, will, and memory—as in the short treatise on the human condition. The soul's threefold character is one pole of an analogy; the other is the divine Trinity: both are unbodily. Hence, where God's unseen likeness can be found is in the immaterial component of the human composite. "The first Adam," made by the Creator in this likeness, fell from grace. But God redeemed the "second Adam" in a new form. The first Adam had been made "for sensual life (*eis psuchēn zōsan*)," according to Paul; the second was destined "for lifegiving spirit (*eis pneuma zōopoioun*)." In Paul's psychology, soul or life (*psuchē*) is intermediate between the unredeemed flesh (*sarx*) and the spirit (*pneuma*) of redemption.43

As in the triad of intellect, will, and memory, the unseen Trinity shows up in the spirit, the soul, and (somehow) the flesh. For the saved, grace redeems even the sinful body, transforming the corrupt frame of the first Adam with a new glory. Salvation will "change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorified body"—the transfigured body of the resurrected Christ. As the etherized skeleton of human worth, God's triadic image—fouled by sin in earthly souls but restored to glory in heaven—is a distinctly Christian notion. The *dignitas* carried by the image is worthiness and also a rank, gauged theologically as higher or lower, merited or unmerited, saved or lost. Bestowed in creation, it can be taken away by damnation, and we hear about none at all in the fallen Adam's body or Eve's. Intellect, will, and memory mirror the Godhead because they are not bodily: they are *dignitates* in the plural, and dematerialized.44

Other voices of the Christian tradition repeated the themes presented by the anonymous tract on the human condition. When they got their start in this form is hard to say, but the text itself was popular

after the twelfth century, when Augustine's views on the soul's triple faculties excited controversy. Although editors have linked earlier authors, Ambrose and Augustine, with the tract as it stands, Alcuin probably produced it four centuries later.45

Different Christian versions of *dignitas* come from Pope Leo I, who died in 461: they are sermons, securely dated and from an authoritative source. During Leo's very assertive papacy, Christ's place in the Trinity was a contentious issue. One thorny problem was Christ's two natures, divine and human, the latter redeeming all humanity when the Word was made flesh. Leo's response was to preach a theology of incarnation, explaining how, why, and with what results God became human, suffered in the body, and died. Leo's sermons show *dignitas* fully assimilated into the Christian vocabulary.46

The pope uses the word often, but in a political sense only to describe his own primacy or 'apostolic *dignitas*,' a supremacy that contrasts with his lowliness (*humilitas*) as Peter's successor.47 Besides the papal office, other things that have this feature are virtues, martyrdom, feast days, rites, the name 'Christian' itself, and the place (much disputed) of the Holy Spirit in the Trinity. Christ's kingly standing also has it, despite mockery by the Jews. Even so, the name 'Israel' has value too, belonging to the chosen people, their elders, and their priests, though the high priest Caiaphas was "estranged' (*alienabatur*) from priestly *dignitas* when he plotted against Jesus.48

Scripture has *dignitas* when Christians—not Jews—interpret it. When the faithful read the Bible, they find God's image at work in the epic of salvation through Christ's incarnation, passion, resurrection,

and transfiguration. Salvation history begins with man's creation "in the image of God in order to imitate his maker," which is the only way for the "*dignitas* of divine majesty to be in us." Though God himself bestowed this standing on Adam, what the first human wanted was higher angelic rank, an arrogant yearning that cost him "the *dignitas* of his own nature, as he took on the sickly condition that we have." Mankind's primal state was worth a great deal, but Adam squandered its value, losing it for the whole human race until Christ restored it with new merit that augmented the original.49

Leo implores his flock to "wake up and recognize the *dignitas* of your nature…. Since you have been made to share the divine nature, do not turn back and revert to your old vileness (*vilitas*)." We humans will gain the "*dignitas* of God's glory" only if his mercy and truth are in us, an issue to be settled by the spirit's struggle against the flesh: "If the body's desires are stronger, the mind loses its own *dignitas* in disgrace." The worth of the spirit—the best of the human person—is mastery of the flesh.50

The saving paradox—Tertullian said "it deserves belief because it is absurd"—is that the Word became flesh, suffered, and died. "When the Lord of the universe took the form of a slave," Leo writes, "he covered up his majestic *dignitas* with darkness." But then, by suffering in the body, he "restored its lost *dignitas* to our nature, which had fallen overboard from the ark of eternity." Later, the transfigured Christ "revealed the excellence of his own hidden *dignitas*." The Apostles had realized that God's majesty was in Jesus, but they could see no sign of it "in the body that covered up divinity…. While they were still wrapped in mortal flesh, there was no way for them to look and see it." Just as the Lord's flesh had cloaked his glory, the bodies of his disciples also blinded them to it. But finally, when the Savior ascended to heaven, humanity recovered its *dignitas* by proxy. "The nature of humankind

rose up beyond the *dignitas* of all heavenly creatures, above the orders of angels."51

The first human nature to soar so high was Christ's and was also divine, already redeemed by the Redeemer's birth and death in the body. At its best, ordinary human nature—unresurrected and unglorified—is spirit, not soul, which is tainted by the body that it enlivens. Hence, man's noblest nature can be nothing like the mortal body. To be exalted, our vile bodies must be changed, made "like unto his glorified body" after the transfiguration. To be nourished by Christian *dignitas*, the human person must be spiritualized, and the human body must become what it never was or could be—entirely glorious. For ordinary mortals, Christian *dignitas* is pie in the sky.52

"Concentrate on eternity," then, "and leave the temporal behind": that is the advice of *De humanae conditionis dignitate et miseria*, an undated text previously attributed to Anselm of Canterbury, who died in 1109. This little devotional piece resembles other Christian treatments of the topic, though with refinements, one of which develops the distinction between the divine image in man and the likeness. The image is "worthier" (*dignior*), since an animal may resemble a human by likeness (*similitudo*), while "none but another human has the image (*imago*) of a human." Applying the same distinction to meritorious acts, Christians (like the ancient pagans) can practice the natural virtues to perfect God's likeness in us. But enacting the divine image means "doing what God does eternally" by remembering, understanding, and loving the best of all, which is God. "For salvation," by that triad of psychic exercises, "you will express the *dignitas* of your creation," a state so elevated that its glory is incomprehensible.

The unspeakable glory is real, if ethereal, and the incarnate God has saved it for sinners striving to be righteous. Meanwhile, vainglory and foolish joy are traps to be avoided by shunning the world's "parade of

<sup>52</sup> Note 45 in this chapter.

*dignitates*" and attending to "the miseries of the present life." Life itself is a shaky bridge over the chasm of hell. Having exalted the divine in man's spirit, the same writer bewails the body's condition at the end of life in language meant to disgust and horrify. In death the flesh will be "stinking and pitiful, consumed by rot and worms." Crawling into every portal of the senses, they stuff the throat and belly to make "the body's whole frame melt away in rot."53

In the line of Christian assaults on the human condition, none suppurates more than the infamous account *Of the Misery of the Human Condition* written by Cardinal Lotario dei Segni in 1195. Dedicating his work to human vileness (*vilitas*), the cardinal promises that he will also "describe the *dignitas* of human nature, humbling the exalted in the present work, then in the next one exalting the humble." But no exaltation ever came: not as diverting as the misery, perhaps? Within three years, Lotario was just too busy, as Pope Innocent III. For almost two decades, he ruled with great energy, chastising heretics, launching crusades, organizing a great ecclesiastical council, frustrating lay authorities, and aggrandizing his own office. Like Leo the Great, he promoted papal primacy with skill and zeal. Today, however, more people remember him for his tirade on human misery than for any of that. No wonder: the language is unforgettable, whatever one thinks of the message.54

Right from the start every human is a disaster. Everyone is born naked, weak, and defiled, covered by blood—"filthy to describe, filthy to hear about, filthiest of all to look at…. Oh, the vile worthlessness (*indignitas*) of the human condition, the unworthy state of human vileness (*vilitas*)!" Clearly, *dignitas* was on Lotario's mind, even though his subject was the opposite. He treats it as rank and status: worse than a distraction, it is an occasion of sin. It incites the ambitious, the

<sup>54</sup> Lotario dei Segni, *De miseria condicionis humanae*, ed. and trans. R. Lewis (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1978), 2–5, 93; Maxwell-Stuart, *Chronicle of the Popes*, 103–7.

power-hungry lust for it, and the proud confuse it with genuine honor. An arrogant person "reckons that his *dignitas* gets more from him than he gets from his *dignitas*." But in the end "power and *dignitas* lie deformed in the dust."55

Until the body returns to dust, it is a prison, and Lotario assumes that everyone wants to escape. "Surely, if you don't want to get out of the body, you don't want to get out of prison since the body is the prison of the soul." As long as the flesh entombs the spirit, "Fear and trembling are all around, toil and pain are everywhere." For the saved, release comes when the body dies, but for the damned the body's sorry tale is a preview of hell. When Cicero warned that the body's pleasures can eliminate *dignitas*, his language was genteel, where the cardinal's is hysterical. The body is doomed to be vile by its matter, "food for the undying worm that keeps gnawing and eating." He speaks directly to the body, taunting it as the dirt of creation and corruption: "Why are you proud," he asks the mud. "What exalts you, dust? Ashes, why, do you boast?"56

Job had the same conversation with decay, saying, "You are my father," and telling the worms, "You are my mother and sister." This prompted Lotario to review the body's whole sad story:

How filthy the father, how vile the mother, how horrid the sister! Man is conceived from blood rotted by the heat of lust, and at the end the worms attend his corpse like pall-bearers. Alive, he breeds lice and parasites. Dead, he will produce worms and flies. When he lives, shit and vomit are his products, rot and stench when he dies.57

Coming from any author, so much guignol would be grand and memorable. With a pope's name attached, it is immortal. Cardinal Lotario

could not have painted a scene much more repellent, by any standards, or more repugnant to any conception of dignity. And yet his rant about the human condition just extends the Christian tradition. Still, why this particular work became a target for Manetti and others is easy to see—with or without a pontifical signature.

## Manetti's Dignity II

This was a book on misery that impressed its readers, including Petrarch, who noticed the author's unkept promise to make the contrary case as well. Weighing a challenge to deliver what Lotario did not, the poet found his task harder than the cardinal's because "human misery is most extensive, while happiness is small." In Petrarch's view, that dour assessment reflected prior Christian experience: he claimed that no one before him had even tried to "investigate the *dignitas* of the human condition." When Facio and Manetti set out to improve on Petrarch's effort, they had no cause to disagree: Lotario's denunciation of vile humanity was the state of the art.58

The cardinal's diatribe had been promoted to papal status long before Manetti dared to attack it—with gusto. Why his assault was so unguarded is unclear: maybe because he was writing for a king and competing with a rival, Facio, who had dedicated his own effort to a pope. Who knows? No nuance of patronage was too subtle for a Florentine diplomat to manipulate. Sincerity is also a possibility: maybe Manetti simply found Lotario's invective as loathsome as it is.59

Otherwise, since he venerated the sages of his faith, since he honored the wisdom of the pagans, Manetti could search in many places for *dignitas*. What he brought back is thin and disappointing. To be

Bernardo, S. Levin, and R. Bernardo (New York: Italica Press, 2005), 641 (16.9); Trinkaus, *Image and Likeness*, 179–82.

<sup>59</sup> Manetti, *De dignitate*, 4.18–19, 44–45.

sure, he is fond of the word and uses it more than Pico would in his *Oration*: twenty-two times. But in a book of thirty-one thousand words—148 pages in the standard edition—this means that *dignitas* appears only once every seven pages or so, hardly enough to sustain it as a thematic term, distinct from others.

In almost all instances, what *dignitas* belongs to is *homo* or something *humanus*. All but uniquely, it is a feature of mankind; the human race; human nature; man's first ancestors; the human soul and its faculties; or the human body and its parts. Exceptionally, it also attaches to Manetti's book, but only because Manetti says so once. The larger point is clear: *dignitas* is human, and humans have *dignitas*. Otherwise, we learn very little. Mankind has something—call it *d* for dignity. In Manetti's inflated prose, we see *d* associated—repetitiously—with other things, *p, q, r*, and so on. So *d* goes along, in various ways, with *p, q, r*, and the others. That's the whole story, as far as conceptualizing *d* is concerned.60

As a result, Manetti's presentation of *d* is vague, in an account whose structure is simple, though it fills four books: the first three deal with the body, the soul, and the body/soul composite; the fourth refutes the case against *d* in humans, especially Lotario's harangue.

Much of the first book goes to long excerpts from Cicero and Lactantius, where *dignitas* comes up only once, when Lactantius describes the human torso. In fact, Lactantius seldom uses the word which is surprising, since he has been called the 'Christian Cicero.' Manetti's large piece of Cicero comes from a study of religion, *On the Nature of the Gods*, which argues for divine providence from design in nature—especially human nature. Erect stature, nimble fingers, well-placed organs of sense, powers of speech and reason, and other endowments are signs of order in humans, also evidence of divine forethought immanent in the world. For Lactantius, the foresight is transcendent and also personal, flowing from the Creator's mind and will, but the evidence is much the same. Human features too orderly to

be accidental are also very special—either rare elsewhere in nature or missing. Mankind is extraordinary, then, standing out from the rest of nature and surpassing everything else.61

Like Lactantius in his study *Of God's Craftwork* and like Cicero *On the Nature of the Gods*, Manetti reviews a larger set of human features (*Q1*) to argue that humans have another smaller set (*Q2*). He includes *d* in *Q2*. For him and for his sources, the *Q1* list is long and detailed, containing many more items than *Q2*, which he derives by induction informally and rhetorically—from *Q1*.

Any step of the induction can fail. For *d* as dignity, in some familiar sense, no single entry on the *Q1* list nor all of them—from what Manetti tells us—entails that *d* is in *Q2*, even though Manetti puts *dignitas* there. Rationality might be listed in *Q1*, for example, and reasoning might promote understanding, which—arguably—could help with *d*. But rationality sometimes breeds cynicism instead. Or immortality: from the experience of endless life, some deeply experienced *d* might emerge, and yet eternity might just be boring, not rewarding at all. Suppose rational and immortal humans were created in God's image: the Creator's majesty might show up as *d* in such creatures. But assets of divine majesty, bodiless and perfect in every way, can do nothing for *d* in imperfect, embodied humans: omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, and so on cannot be finite, bodily, or humanized.

Manetti never shows that *d* must belong to every human or even what it is. He never argues in this way:

- 1. Every *d* is *X*.
- 2. Also, whatever has *X* has *d*.
- 3. But every human has X.
- 4. Therefore, every human has *d*.

Dei*, 8.1–13.9, esp. 10.26; Cicero, *De natura deorum libri tres, with Introduction and Commentary*, ed. J. Mayor and J.

For *d* as Kantian dignity and *X* as intrinsic worth, the schema seems promising, though dubious for *X* as immortality or rationality: in such cases, the argument goes wrong at the start. The first premise must be a satisfactory definition or at least a workable description, which Manetti never supplies, while stating the third premise in many different forms and asserting the conclusion often.

Quarreling with a pope about the human condition, Manetti insists that humans have *dignitas* without saying what it is, though contemporaries were asking such definitional questions about liberty, republican virtue, and other ideas debated in the literature of 'civic humanism.' Matteo Palmieri's discussion *Of Civic Life*, for example, was circulating in Florence and elsewhere before Manetti decided to answer Lotario. Palmieri writes that

each one's standing (*dignità*) is the basis on which public honors are distributed. In a commonwealth (*reppublica*), it's difficult to determine whose standing is greater because of various disagreements about it. The noble and powerful say that standing is to be located in abundant resources and old, aristocratic families. Populists put it in well-meaning talk among the cultured about living free and in peace. The learned call it the ability to get things done.62

Since Palmieri's focus is sociopolitical, he starts by describing *dignità* more or less as Cicero had, as status that comes with public office and civic engagement. Then he examines it as a socioeconomic commodity, a cultural ideal and a tool of politics, knowing that there are competing versions of *dignità*. For Manetti, however, *dignitas* is not a contested idea; the contest that he wants to win is about which creatures have it.

<sup>62</sup> Matteo Palmieri, *Della vita civile* (Florence: Sansoni, 1982) 3.136–37; James Hankins, "Machiavelli, Civic Humanism and the Humanist Politics of Virtue," *Italian Culture* 23 (2014): 103.

Lacking a better account of *dignitas* by Manetti, where else can we go to learn what he might have said? Statements that include the word not quite two dozen—give us little to go on. Widening the search and also looking for *dignus*, the adjective cognate with the noun, will more than double our information. One use of *dignus* can be eliminated as unhelpful, however: the much repeated *memoratu dignus* or 'worth mentioning.' Subtracting it leaves more than fifty cases where other words used with *dignus* or *dignitas* say something instructive. Most occur only once, and in every instance the paired word is inherently positive or positively meant. The aggregate good news is about fitness, power, rank, size, and stature.

Associated words used more than once—to deliver the same message—are 'excellent' (*excellens*), 'great' (*magnus*), 'lofty' (*sublimis*), 'outstanding' (*praestans*), and 'wonderful' (*admirabilis*). In keeping with the title of Manetti's book, *excellentia* is the most frequent partner for *dignitas*, and *praestantia* comes next in the blur of pleonasms. Humans have *dignitas,* and they excel, standing out from everything around them. Human creatures so well equipped surpass the rest of creation. The word is relative, then, expressing rank. The *d* in question is neither unrelatable nor intrinsic nor incomparable. Understood in Manetti's way, *dignitas* feeds on comparison and starves without it.63

Ever since Kant theorized about *Würde*, the debate about dignity has gone on and on. Kant himself identified the Latin *dignitas* with *Würde*, stirring up excitement about Pico's misnamed *Oration*. Suppose the mistake had been different and the speech had been

<sup>63</sup> For *dignitas* and its pairings, see note 60 of this chapter, linking with 'broad' (*latus*), 'distinguished' (*praecipuus*), 'exalted' (*exaltatus*), 'genuine' (*verus*), 'handsome' (*amplus*), 'immense' (*immensus*), 'incredible' (*incredibilis*), 'lordly' (*dominans*), 'mighty' (*potens*), 'noble' (*nobilis*), 'ranked' (*gradatus*), 'suitable' (*accomodatus*), and 'unique' (*unicus*): to simplify this list, various forms of the word have been converted to adjectives. For *dignus* and its pairings, see Manetti, *De dignitate,* 1.pr.1-, 34, 43–45, 52; 2.8, 23, 30; 3.11, 13, 22, 41, 45, 49–50, 56, 59; 4.18, 25, 28.

mislabeled differently, as an *Oratio de hominis excellentia* or *De praestantia hominis*—words from Manetti's *d* vocabulary. Had Pico been thought to orate about 'excellence' or 'superiority,' would so much fuss have been made about the speech or about 'humanist' ideas of dignity? Not likely. In human affairs, where all the timber is crooked, how could *Würde* excel or surpass anything—in Kantian terms? Kant's is a modern dignity that belongs incomparably to everyone.

## Manetti's Dignity III

Not so for Manetti, whose *dignitas* is synonymous, more or less, with *excellentia* and *praestantia*—though what such words mean to him is notable in its own right: more on that later. For now, my topic is his use of *dignitas*, which is not just evaluative but also exclusionary—as the ancient Romans used it for rank and status and medieval Christians for God's image reflected in man. No woman, child, or slave could excel with *dignitas* in Rome. In medieval Christendom, however, all soldiers of the church militant were members of Christ's spiritual body, battling the flesh to cross the bridge from this vale of tears—on the road, at least, to a spiritualized *dignitas*. But what about Muslims? Heathens in Brazil? Those cases would prove difficult. No doubt about the unchurched Christians in hell, however, damned but still human. Those poor souls have lost *dignitas* forever—more pitiful than Adam, whose loss was redeemed.64

Among the deadliest sins of the damned, all seven can be bodily and three must be, to some extent: lust, sloth, and gluttony. The body

<sup>64</sup> Anthony Pagden, *The Fall of Natural Man: The American Indian and the Origins of Comparative Ethnology* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press); Copenhaver and Charles Schmitt, *Renaissance Philosophy* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992), 112–16; Lars Pharo, "The Council of Valladolid (1550–1551): A European Disputation about the Human Dignity of Indigenous Peoples of the Americas," in Düwell et al., *Cambridge Handbook of Human Dignity*, 95–100.

is a cesspool of sin: that is the papal position rejected by Manetti. In the process, he did not produce a clear concept of *dignitas* or modernize it. But he accomplished something else by revaluing the body and showing new esteem for human energy and ingenuity—especially the artistic kind. Most of his comments on the body come in the first and fourth books of his work. Much of the first book is by Cicero and Lactantius. But the refutation of human misery in the fourth is all Manetti and quite lively.

A preliminary move sets Lotario up by restating his vituperation of the body: weak, naked, fragile, rotten, short-lived, defective in its senses, self-destructive in its actions, vulnerable to the least threats of injury and disease, it never recovers from its origin and growth out of the filthiest matter—the slime of the earth and the stink of menstruation. The papal screed is haphazard, Manetti complains, though evidently hard to forget:

It goes on endlessly with a variety of remarks about these many troubles of the human body: nakedness, lice, spit, piss, shit, fleeting time, advancing age, the different pains that mortals suffer, the various things that people try, the nearness of death, and the many types of torment.

To counter all this, Manetti points out that what is "best and delectable" in the human condition was put there by God almighty, so that we should always "live in this world with joy and cheer." Pleasure (*voluptas*) is God's gift—not a pitfall—and a normal expectation of human life. The external senses give immense pleasure, and the internal senses also contribute to the "great pleasures that captivate man." In daily life which sense is most pleasurable? Eating is certainly good. We must eat to live. Food and drink are tasty as well, better than most sensations of touch—except for the "touch specific to the genitals." Philosophers say that "far greater pleasure is felt in sex because nature's purpose was to preserve the species more than individuals, the one by sex between a male and a female, the other by taking nourishment."65

The body's pleasure is excellent, says Manetti, and sex is best of all. This was not Lotario's verdict. "Who does not know," he had asked, "that copulation, even in marriage, never happens without the flesh itching, without heated lust, without the rank stench of excess." Coming from this mire, semen is defiled and pollutes the soul, "like liquid poured from a corrupt vessel." Whatever the body excretes is unclean, says Lotario, but a boon according to Manetti: "Think of what physicians have written about saliva, urine, feces, and hair." These are remedies, antidotes, and fertilizer. Plainly, he is determined to turn every bit of Lotario's blaming into praise.66

Provoked again by Job, Lotario gives a chapter to nakedness: "Naked came I out of my mother's womb, naked shall I return there." The cardinal charges that humans emerge bare from the gore of childbirth, filthy and defenseless. Manetti's retort—before defending the afterbirth as a physiological necessity—is that nakedness "became man by reason of grace (*decus*) and beauty." If humans were born with hides or pelts, they would be as ugly as other animals, and man's excellence (*excellentia*) would be hidden. But nature would never conceal the human body, her most splendid production, "with cheap and illfitting veils."67

Just because Lotario had condemned nakedness—one might think—Manetti had to praise it. But other reasons were true to his time, when more and better nakedness could be seen than in Lotario's day: in works of art.

Although pictorial and sculptural art was mainly religious in the Middle Ages, some sacred scenes show people unclothed or nearly so. In the Hebrew Bible, besides the creation, we have Noah drunk,

David peeking at Uriah's wife, and the elders leering at Susanna. Depictions of the Christian Gospels even show Jesus unclothed (See Fig. 5.3)—only partly, most of the time—for his baptism and during his passion and burial. Humans roasting in purgatory have left flesh and bones behind, but souls depicted as bare bodies make the burning visible and plausible. The dead unwind their shrouds at the Judgment. Some are saints, like Sebastian—naked except for the arrows. There was no shortage of imagery, to which medieval artists regularly applied their skill.68

Still, just thinking of the male figure, there is nothing in medieval art like Michelangelo's David or Adam—or the Greco-Roman artifacts that instructed Alberti, Botticelli, Donatello, Leonardo, Mantegna, the elder Pollaiuolo, and others before Adam was pictured on the Sistine Chapel ceiling in 1511, just as Julius II was moving the Apollo Belvedere (penis missing, but no fig leaf ) to the Vatican. A few years earlier, Michelangelo had seen the male nudes of the Laocoon writhing during its excavation. But Manetti died in 1459, long before these capital events of archaeology and the body's grand apotheosis in sculpture and painting. At an earlier stage, however, he may have sensed the force of this enormous change in human experience and attitudes.69

Praising the soul in the second book of his work, he sets out to prove the "large scope and excellence of the soul's faculties" by examining "great deeds and the remarkable devices people have thought up and so admirably invented." Ancient examples are the pyramids of Egypt but also the first ship, built by Jason for the Argonauts. Knowing how valuable the "technology of sailing" was to his own

society, Manetti looks homeward for other feats of engineering, finding them in

more recent structures that are new, and in the very sharp mind of Filippo, called Brunelleschi, in our day surely the prince of all architects, who erected a great—no, an immense—vault for Florence's Temple with no wooden or iron framework, as stunning as that is to say.

Manetti, a Florentine, had to look no farther than his city's proudest church for proof of supreme human skill in architecture, and for the pictorial arts he could also stay at home. First he runs through the usual list of ancient painters and then adds Praxiteles, Phidias, and Polyclitus for sculpture. In painting, "What to say about our Giotto, the best painter of his time? … It seems right to set him alongside the ancient and supreme masters of this art and compare them." In sculpture, Ghiberti's Doors of Paradise for Florence's Baptistery equal anything by the Greeks. "What to report about Lorenzo," he asks, "the most eminent sculptor of our time, whose outstanding and amazing talents are on public display, especially on the doors of our sacred Temple that he ennobled and glorified?" Is this praise for the arts in Florence just patriotic boilerplate from a diplomat's speeches?70

Likewise, maybe Manetti is just reciting from a source to describe a celebrated Aphrodite by Praxiteles, so lovely "that it was hard to keep her safe and undefiled by the leering glances of bypassers." This anecdote from a book on exemplary behavior has been toned down by comparison to other old tales about the charms of statuary: reporting on Praxiteles with less reserve, Pliny had written that "a certain person was so gripped by love for the statue that one night he hid away, hugging it close, and as evidence left the stain of his lust on the likeness."71

Such early records of the higher pornography—for better or worse captured a common and authentic human response. When Manetti retails one of these stories, while commending his city's artistic glories, perhaps he too says something genuine about feelings of two kinds, sexual and aesthetic, as they converge on the visual experience of art. A little speculation is worthwhile—for chronological reasons.

By 1504, when Michelangelo finished his majestic David in marble, with its full-frontal display of genitalia, Manetti had been dead for nearly fifty years. He can have seen no nudes by Botticelli or Leonardo—still children when he died. Pollaiuolo was just leaving his father's workshop. Mantegna made the splendid St. Sebastians in Vienna and the Louvre after 1455: he was sketching nudes before then, however, though none that Manetti could have seen. Most of the great Quattrocento images of the human form were unavailable to him—except perhaps one, Donatello's bronze David (See Fig. 5.4), now in the Bargello. Some critics have doubted that David is the beautiful young boy—naked except for high-top sandals and a fetching cap. Others have named Cosimo de' Medici as the source of the commission and have dated the statue as early as the 1420s: Donatello had made a clothed David for public showing in Florence by 1416.72

Did Manetti ever see the nude David in bronze, the first casting of its kind since antiquity? Probably so, if Donatello finished it by midcentury—as seems likely. In any case, since Mantegna and others were sketching nudes before Manetti started to write, ventures so bold were underway in Italy: such innovations in art impressed him, remarkable novelties like the "great deeds" of Giotto, Ghiberti, and Brunelleschi.

Still, though nudity, male and/or female, may have given Manetti delight and moved him to praise the body, his measure of humankind at its best was still Christian and more otherworldly than not. Toward the close of his fourth book, trying hard to wind the story down, he

<sup>72</sup> John Pope-Hennessy, *Donatello Sculptor* (Ney York: Abbeville Press, 1993), 38–46, 147–56; Ronald Lightbown, *Mantegna: With a Complete Catalogue of the Paintings, Drawings and Prints* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1986), 408, 420–21, 481–87; plates XI, 43–45, 97, 130.

dismisses warnings about human troubles because "man's pleasure is continuous from the moment of birth until the very end." Then he refutes the contrary claims by invoking "the final resurrection of our bodies." He promises that "when we rise again, we shall take up our deceased bodies, most gloriously—without any blemish, corruption, weakness, or deformity." In perfect health and lasting youth, never needing sleep and without suffering, we shall live again in a body something like Christ's was at the age of thirty. It will be a transfigured, glorified body, "delicate and light, … shining and unstained, … of flawless beauty." In the end, as the damned look up hopelessly at the saved, they will see "bright, airy, agile, graceful, and immortal bodies that never know pain."73

Whether Manetti ever looked on beauty bare, by contemplating the body as idealized in Quattrocento art, he never abandoned a different idealization, the glorified body that is a likeness of the transfigured Christ. Any nobility in this keystone of Christian dogma vanishes in the fairy tale of immortality that follows—a timeless paradise populated by bodies too glorified to be avatars of mortal, earthly originals. With many words, while maintaining that humans have *dignitas*, Manetti puts the body forward as evidence. But he fails both ways. His *dignitas* has no conceptual basis. And his glorified bodies cannot plausibly be pictured or even imagined.

Imagine Aunt Fiona and Uncle Fred called to glory, Fiona with her remarkable overbite, Fred as cross-eyed as ever. Glorifying those beloved faces would deplete them. In any believable picturing of the choir invisible, the bodies—naked bodies especially—will look a little vile because all bodies are a little vile, at least—even Adam's on the ceiling. Pater suggests as much about "that languid figure, … rude and satyr-like." This Adam "has hardly strength enough to lift his finger," and he says nothing. But his nakedness speaks more in silence about human dignity than Manetti ever could with all his words.74

<sup>74</sup> Note 18 of this chapter.

## Conclusion

Nonetheless, Manetti's praise of the body and of human energy and skill earns applause, even though his orotund talk about *dignitas* is sketchy in content, mainly rhetorical, and vacuous at bottom. The scanty *dignitas* in Pico's *Oration* is of no use at all to students of dignity: that notion is not the subject of his speech. If Pico's *dignitas* is useless and Manetti's is uninteresting, why bother? For two reasons. First, history has made Pico too big to fail. Second, habitual misconceptions of the *Oration* are symptoms of larger strains in modern conversations about dignity. Since Manetti's book is the fullest Quattrocento treatment of the Latin analog of 'dignity,' his treatment of *dignitas* is also relevant especially to show what Pico was not talking about.

The strain on 'dignity' in modern times—as in Manetti's day—has been rhetorical in no small part, tempting many to the sin of bathos, a 'depth' to which one sinks by failing to rise. The Internet calls it "an abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect." The 'exalted' or 'sublime' for ancient literary critics was *hupsos*, or 'height,' with bathos as its opposite, when attempted *hupsos* ends badly and exaltation crashes. Not all *bathos* is bad, however, if it really goes deep, in a good way—like Christ's love, which is both deep and high in the Epistle to the Ephesians. Bathos comes in types and degrees.75

Here is a mild case, headlined by the *New York Times* a few years ago:

## Restore a Gateway to Dignity

The words are meant to be stirring. The article they introduce explores a serious issue, plans to replace Penn Station, a major railway terminal in Manhattan. To "address the calamity that is Penn Station," the author compares it with Grand Central Station: passing through it is

<sup>75</sup> Ephes. 3:18; [Long.] *Subl*.; https://en.wikipedia.org.

"an ennobling experience," whereas Penn Station is "a humiliation" hence the missing dignity and the call to restore it. But look: this is just journalism, New York City journalism in the Age of Hype, when any human misfortune qualifies as a 'tragedy'—gripes from Aristotle notwithstanding. Why fret about a little heartfelt hyperbole? Because this bathos is about 'dignity' and at ground level, not yet headed for the stratosphere. Such commonplace bathos is all around us, sometimes with 'dignity' in tow.76

A more recent piece from the *New Yorker* about Anthony Trollope cashes in on the conspicuous expenditure of 'dignity.' Trollope, careful about time and money, could have modeled rationality for Max Weber. A writer himself, the author explains that "writers talking about time are like painters talking about unprimed canvas and pigments." Riding a crest of wit, he adds an insider's joke: "Nor is there anything philistine about writers talking money. Inside the ballroom at the PEN banquet, it's all freedom and dignity; outside, it's all advances."77

The author of the Penn Station article is serious about dignity in a train station—just as Cicero was serious about the house on the Palatine. The author of the Trollope article knows that seriousness about 'dignity' can be funny. The second article has no connection with the first, just taking it for granted that 'dignity' can do a comic turn. This is odd, considering the word's grave prominence in such places as the UN Declaration of 1948, whose first "whereas" is that "recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world."78

Freedom, justice, and peace are serious matters. By proclaiming them in this way, the world's chief deliberative body intended to combat war, genocide, racism, hunger, disease, and other problems of that

magnitude. How could a key term in its proclamation—"dignity" become an occasion for comedy? In part, because this is a notable case of a common failing in a pronouncement that overdraws its moral accounts by asserting the rights of "the human family." Family? The Declaration was adopted three years after the bombing of Hiroshima.

But "family" here is a hope, aspiring to a worthy ideal. And politics, not to speak of international politics, demands the leaky writing by committee that produced the Declaration—which has no author, only "drafters," and not everyone is Thomas Jefferson. Complaining about bathos in the UN Declaration is mean-spirited, and mockery would be worse. Yet mockery we have always with us.

In the pivotal (for Pico) year of 1948, when the Declaration was made official, Evelyn Waugh published *The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy*, his savage parody of the American funeral industry. *Vile Bodies* had been his breakout book in 1930. Jessica Mitford (Waugh had pursued her sister) followed *The Loved One* with *The American Way of Death*. What Waugh had done as a novelist, she did again as a reporter, tallying the data about burying the dead in North America. One datum was a meeting organized "to upgrade the standard of dying," as Mitford puts it, by the Society of American Florists. The Society's stake in the funeral business was large. To protect it, a Symposium on Sentiment was convened, and the assembled florists heard a Statement on Memorialization that, in Mitford's description, "had quite a lot to say about the Dignity of Man, the United States as champion of freedom and leader of the democratic nations of the world, the importance of the individual, the profound traditions of the centuries and so on."79

<sup>79</sup> Evelyn Waugh, *The Loved One: An Anglo-American Tragedy* (New York: Little Brown, 1948); Jessica Mitford, *The American Way of Death Revisited* (New York: Random House, 1998), 78–79. The year 1948 was quite a watershed for Pico and dignity: while the UN was making its Declaration, the *Renaissance Philosophy of Man* put the *Oration* into English, and *Walden II* made B. F. Skinner famous for novelizing the behaviorism made more explicit by *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*. But that is another story.

Sounds like Jessica had heard about the UN's Declaration. The Statement that she reports on declares that

the final rites, memorial tributes, the hallowed pageant of the funeral service all speak for the dignity of man…. Memorialization is love … [that] can never die. It is the recognition of the immortality of the human spirit, the rightful reverence earned by the good life. It is the final testimony to the dignity of man.80

Comedy cannot deflate a balloon before something has inflated it. For the "dignity of man," what was this? How had that sonorous phrase become an incitement to ridicule by the middle of the last century? A large part of the story was politics as usual, as in the UN Declaration. A smaller part was the continual boosting of Pico della Mirandola as the herald of modern human dignity. The collection of Renaissance texts that disseminated his speech to American college students also came out in 1948.

Going on sixty years later, Pico thrives: a Wikipedia site advertises his *Oration* as the "Manifesto of the Renaissance" and "a key text of Renaissance humanism." The adulation echoes long-playing praises of a type sustained by a prize-winning book, *The Idea of the Renaissance*, where a whole chapter goes to "Pico della Mirandola and Renaissance Ambition." The authors try to capture the *Oration* in an arpeggio of extrapolations from it, noting that the speech is "often … taken to be constitutive of the Renaissance as a period" and that it "divulged the self-conceived dignity of Renaissance man." Pico's words, unpublished by him and prefacing a canceled debate, are his "definitive testament, and its traditional place in Renaissance studies seems … appropriate."81

Why make so much in such grand language of a failed speech? Why idolize its author—claiming, for example, that at the end of the eighteenth century "the structure of the Piconian moment … reappeared in Kant's mathematical sublime: an apprehension of the majesty of the illimitable, … producing a restless aspiration similar to that of Pico's Adam"? Alas: Kant was more responsible for our mistakes about Pico than Pico was for Kant's idea of the sublime. Such misunderstandings of history and philosophy are easier to correct than lapses of judgment in prose that propagates them—though that is one of the aims of comedy like Mitford's. One would think that mockery like hers would make bathos too risky. But writing about dignity—especially with Pico in the cast—is a festival of bathos.82

# *Reflection*: Portraiture, Social Positioning, and Displays of Dignity in Early Modern London
*Edward Town*

Whether rich, poor, native-born, or foreign, the inhabitants of London of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century conceived of dignity in terms of their social status. In this period, "dignity" was what was deemed appropriate to an individual's station as ordained by God. For the most part, these were privileges enjoyed by those in "a place of honor," which afforded them office and authority. As a result, Elizabethan and Jacobean society was strictly hierarchical; codified through the right to participate in politics or trade, the right to bear arms (both heraldic insignia and weapons), and the right to wear certain garments and fabrics.

On paper this was an ordered society, but within the context of an urban environment in post-Reformation England, things were not always as they seemed. The age of the "new man" saw unprecedented opportunities for individuals to accumulate wealth through trade and investment, which enabled them to buy their way into civic and government office. London's population swelled as people flooded into the city from the provinces and from abroad seeking advancement or safe harbor. Moreover, the growth of this capitalist economy created new wants and fashions that

further upset the status quo, for within a densely populated and increasingly multicultural metropolis such as London it was hard enough to regulate people's movement within the city, let alone their position up and down the social ladder. In short, status was a commodity that could be bought.

At the same time, however, preachers railed in their sermons against the vices associated with aspiration, ambition, and social mobility. In his 1616 *Diseases of the soule a discourse diuine, morall and physicall*, Thomas Adams identified the full panoply of those who suffered from the "immoderate Thirst of Ambition" where "The poore labourer would be a farmer: the farmer after two or three deare years aspires to a yeoman: the yeomans sonne must be a Gentleman. The Gentlemans *ambition* flies Iustice-height. He is out of square with being a Squire, and shoots at knighthood. Once knighted, his dignitie is nothing, except worth a noble title."1

These conflicting positions are found manifest in the art of the period. In particular, the second half of the sixteenth century saw a dramatic rise in the number of portraits commissioned by urban elites in England and Wales.2 We know from the diary of the London musician and composer Thomas Whythorne that the decision to commission a portrait was often occasioned by a significant milestone, be it a moment of professional success or survival from a life-threatening disease, and that it came hand in hand with serious personal and spiritual introspection.3 And yet in the puritanical climate of the day the very act of commissioning a portrait was deemed by some to be contentious. As one contemporary commentator put it scathingly: "Every Citizen's wife that wears a taffeta kirtle and a velvet hatt … must have her picture

in the parlour."4 Anticipating such aspersions, wealthy citizens had portraits made that stressed their modesty, humility, and dignity by including various memento mori devices, such as skulls upon which they rested their hands, or inscriptions that expressed similar vanitas sentiment.

One of the best visual expressions of the foregoing tangle of social forces of the period can be found in two paintings made in London during the 1570s by the Flemish émigré artist Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder, known by the titles *A fête at Bermondsey* and *A Village Festival* (figs. 5R.1 and 5R.2). These pictures are unusual as composites of landscape, genre painting, and portraiture. Indeed, nothing is readily comparable to them in English or Flemish art of this period. The compositions of these pictures are also composite in nature, being derived from a combination of firsthand topographical observation (with the inclusion of the Tower of London in the *Fête*) and a variety of engraved printed sources.

Both the *Fête* and the *Village Festival* are now in the collection of the Marquess of Salisbury and on display at Hatfield House in Herefordshire, England. The circumstances under which the *Village Festival* was commissioned are not known, but a discretely placed verse inscription on the bottom left of the *Fête* records that this picture was commissioned by a wealthy Flemish merchant resident in London named Jacques Hoefnagel, who wanted a painting illustrating all the fashions that could be seen in England. As such, the *Fête* (and indeed the *Village Festival*) show figures depicted in costume from France, Venice, England, and elsewhere across Europe, derived from the costume book assembled and illustrated by the Flemish poet, painter, and minister of the Dutch church in London, Lucas de Heere.

<sup>4</sup> Robert Tittler, *Portraits, Painters and Publics in Provincial England, 1540–1640* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), 59.

Marriage celebrations serve as the premise for both paintings, and provide the occasion for the coming together of a diverse group of individuals that might not otherwise coalesced. In the *Fête* the scene is set on the south bank of the river Thames, while in the *Village Festival* the celebrations are conducted within an imaginary country landscape. An orderly procession moves from right to left across the paintings, led by a cupbearer holding aloft a vase filled with rosemary tied with ribbons. The portraits contained within these pictures—that is, of the various people in the processionals or staged outside the processional—are rendered with remarkable skill, and appear here and there across the foreground; some together in small groups, others set within the wider crowd of generic figures. Also important, as I have argued elsewhere, the artist, Gheeraerts the Elder, placed his own portrait in both compositions and is recognizable as the only figure looking out directly toward the viewer.5 The other figures in the paintings are less easily identified, but there is good reason to believe they were members of the community of exiled Netherlandish humanists in London of which Gheeraerts was a part. After all, in addition to Gheeraerts, Hoefnagel (who commissioned one of these paintings) and de Heere (whose costume book served as a basis for the painting) were also Calvinists who had fled religious persecution by the Spanish in the Netherlands. More to the point, all three were important figures within a burgeoning international community of displaced merchants, humanist scholars, poets, and artists. And now we draw close to the connection with dignity.

On reflection, one of the most striking elements of both paintings is the strong sense of dignity that is conveyed by the individuals portrayed in these pictures: in their contained demeanor, measured gesture, and sober dress they convey the type

<sup>5</sup> Edward Town, "'A Fête at Bermondsey': An English landscape by Marcus Gheeraerts the Elder," *Burlington Magazine* 157 (2015): 309–17.

of dignity that was defined by modesty, humility, and piety. This is made all the more apparent by the carnivalesque backdrop of peasants dancing and trysting, and the wretched figure deprived of what little dignity he might otherwise have who is incarcerated in the stocks. In other words, the dignity of the individuals portrayed in the processionals suggests a desire to establish a position for the displaced, Calvinist, cultural elite within the alien and often hostile London social hierarchy. At the same time, and crucially, the paintings convey a desire to assert this social position *subtly*—namely, in way that would walk the delicate line the more puritanical elements of London were proscribing in reaction to the "upstart" dignity of the socially upward—a line, it will be remembered, was partly being drawn with explicit reference to the new portrait market. By remaining spectators rather than participants in the face of the potentially subversive carnivalesque, Gheeraerts and his fellow exiles reiterated their commitment to their reformed faith, demonstrated their dignity, and in doing so, asserted their "proper" position within the society of their adopted home.

# Chapter 6: Equal Dignity and Rights
*Stephen Darwall*

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. —American Declaration of Independence

Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family … —Universal Declaration of Human Rights1

(Article 1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. (Article 2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world. —The Basic Law, Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany2

The idea that human persons have a distinctive value or *dignity* that is intimately bound up with basic human rights has proven one of the Enlightenment's most enduring legacies. Germany's *Grundgesetz* declares quite explicitly that human dignity is "inviolable," and

<sup>1</sup> Universal Declaration of Human Rights. http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/index.shtml.

<sup>2</sup> Axel Tschentscher, trans., *The Basic Law (Grundgesetz) 2012: The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany*. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1501131.

"*therefore*" that "inviolable and inalienable human rights" must be acknowledged. We find a similar idea in the American Declaration of Independence. "Dignity" doesn't appear, but the claim is implicit that "all men" share a fundamentally equal status that entails or includes basic inalienable rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights also lacks the *Grundgesetz*'s "therefore," but it nonetheless clearly also ties human dignity and rights closely together.

The main question I want to consider in this chapter is how human dignity must be conceived if it is to be capable of grounding human rights. There is no doubt, however, that different conceptions, even different concepts, of dignity have figured in the history of moral and political thought. And many of these bear no relation to human rights whatsoever.

## Ciceronian Dignity

"Dignity" originally referred to high social rank or status and "the honors and respectful treatment that are due to someone who occupied that position," as Michael Rosen puts it.3 According to Christopher McCrudden, this is the sense of "*dignitas hominis* in classical Roman thought."4 As McCrudden and Rosen read the history, it was Cicero's *De Officiis* that marked an important and influential departure from the originally social-conventional sense of "dignity." Although Cicero sometimes uses *dignitas* in its customary social sense, he also introduces the idea of "the dignity of the human race." *Human* dignity for Cicero is nothing that could be established by conventional patterns of deference. It is the idea, rooted in the ancient notion of a great chain of being, that distinctive capacities for self-development "by

study and reflection" give human beings a "nature" "superior" to that of "cattle and other animals." Other species are motivated only by sensory instincts, whereas human beings can "learn that sensual pleasure is wholly unworthy of the dignity of the human race," and be guided by this understanding.5

This early Ciceronian theme reverberates throughout the dignity tradition, including most prominently Kant.6 It finds something of a modernizing twist in the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola. For Pico, human dignity is rooted in the human capacity to shape one's own life: "It is given to him to have that which he chooses and to be what he wills."7

A deep connection between the human capacity for autonomous rational choice and a dignity that can ground human rights is, I shall argue, a central aspect of the notion of human dignity as it developed in the early modern period, especially in the tradition of modern natural law of Grotius and Pufendorf. It should be clear, however, that nothing in the Ciceronian notion of human dignity requires, or even leads naturally to, basic human rights. The proposition, for example, that "sensual pleasure" is "unworthy" of human dignity is less a thesis about what human beings are in a position to claim from one another by virtue of their dignity than it is an ethical standard to which we are to live up. Similarly, although Pico held that human dignity depends on the capacity for human choice, his point was not to argue for a

<sup>5</sup> Quoted in McCrudden, "Human Dignity," 657; and Rosen, *Dignity*, 12.

<sup>6</sup> Rosen interprets Kant as holding that dignity is a value that is realized in moral action, when the agent imposes the moral law (pure practical reason) on herself despite (potential) inclinations to act otherwise (Rosen, *Dignity*, 19–31; see also Richard Dean, *The Value of Humanity in Kant's Moral Theory* [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006] and Stephen Darwall, "Kant on Respect, Dignity, and the Duty of Respect," in *Kant's Virtue*, ed. Monika Betzler [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008], 175–200). On this interpretation, Kant's view is not that any agent with the capacity for moral action has dignity; rather dignity is realized only by the good will that successfully exercises this capacity. Such a conception of dignity is a doubtful ground for human rights, as I shall be arguing.

<sup>7</sup> Pico Della Mirandola, *On the Dignity of Man*, trans. C. Glenn Wallis et al. (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1965), 5. See also McCrudden, "Human Dignity," 659; and Rosen, *Dignity*, 14–15.

fundamental right to shape one's life as one will, but to set up an argument that human beings *should* choose, of their own will, to live a certain kind of life, indeed, an angelic life.8

"Dignity" in many of its uses carries similar connotations of an aspirational standard one should live up to, or not sink below, as in "That would be beneath your dignity." Carrying oneself "with dignity" or being "dignified" is conducting oneself in ways that others can look up to or at least not down on. When used in this sense, the synonym of "dignity" is "noble" and its antonym, "base." It implies, as well, that its bearer, a person *having* dignity, lives up to the standard from her own sense that not to would be beneath her. She thus achieves a kind of (appraisal) self-respect and avoids what would elicit her own contempt.9

Hume uses "dignity" in this sense when he speaks of "dignity of character" as including "elevation of mind" or "sentiment": "disdain of slavery, and with that noble pride and spirit, which arises from conscious virtue."10 Dignity here is a justified sense of one's own merit, that one is an appropriate object of esteem, one's own and others. We find the same thought in Adam Smith when, following Hume, he distinguishes between the "amiable" virtues of "candid condescension and indulgent humanity" and "awful" virtues "of self-denial, of self-government, of that command of the passions which subjects all the movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and the propriety of our own conduct require."11

These uses of dignity are Ciceronian in implicating a standard of virtuous self-command that is rooted in a "superior" human capacity to govern passions and instincts we share with other animals. Mill's familiar doctrine of higher and lower pleasures imports this Ciceronian notion into a view of human welfare, as does its lesser known precursor in Frances Hutcheson. First, Hutcheson:

In comparing pleasures of different kinds, the value is as the duration and dignity of the kind jointly. We have an immediate sense of a dignity, a perfection, or beatifick quality in some kinds, which no intenseness of the lower kinds can equal, were they also as lasting as we could wish. No intenseness or duration of any external sensation gives it a dignity or worth equal to that of the improvement of the soul by knowledge, or the ingenious arts; and much less is it equal to that of virtuous affections and actions.12

As Mill would later, Hutcheson holds that some pleasures are intrinsically higher, therefore better, than others. As Mill put it memorably, "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."13 Why does a human being "never wish to sink into what he feels is a lower grade of existence"? Mill answers: "a sense of dignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other."14

These claims directly concern what makes life better for the person living it, well-being rather than either merit (warranted esteem)

or superior normative standing in a "great chain of being." But when pleasures are said to be better for those who have them *because* of their dignity, then dignity is being invoked as a normative concept that is independent of well-being, namely, of merit or superior normative standing. The claim is that experiences and activities that warrant esteem, and of which we can be justifiably proud, benefit us more, and because we can be proud of them, or for the reasons that warrant pride and esteem.

Obviously, any concept of dignity capable of grounding or entailing claims of human right must be normative. Moreover, human rights claims are a distinctive *kind* of normative claim, entailing obligations to rights holders to respect their rights, and therefore implicating all that is necessary for such correlative rights and obligations to exist. I shall be arguing, following earlier work of mine, that the normativity of basic human rights is irreducibly second personal and that any normative proposition capable of grounding human rights must therefore also be second personal, or justifiable within a second-personal framework.15

Even without any such analysis, however, we can see that Ciceronian dignity is not a normative concept of the right kind to entail claims of right. That I am a being capable of realizing distinctively human virtues and excellences, or even that I do realize these, has no necessary bearing on human rights whatsoever. A philosopher might reject the whole idea of human rights while thoroughly accepting the kinds of Ciceronian claims about human dignity we have been canvassing.

<sup>15</sup> By "second personal," I mean that these normative phenomena are distinguished by their conceptual tie to forms of mutual accountability that invariably involve (at least implicit) forms of *address*, which are naturally expressed with the second-person pronoun.

## Dignity, Rank, and Rights

Recall the original sense of "dignity" as high social status and rank: a place of honor. Since this often included, as Rosen points out, "the honors and respectful treatment that are due to someone who occupied that position," perhaps it would be more promising to model a concept of human dignity capable of grounding rights on this sense.16 An obvious problem with doing so, however, is that social status is not a normative notion. Patterns of deference and respectful treatment constituting high status de facto entail nothing about how people in that position *should* be treated (de jure) or about normatively valid claims they might therefore have on others or others' correlative obligations to them. This comes out clearly in Hobbes's definition of dignity in *Leviathan*:

The public worth of a man, which is the value set on him by the commonwealth, is that which men commonly call dignity. And this value of him by the commonwealth, is understood, by offices of command, judicature, public employment; or by names and titles, introduced for distinction of such value.17

A person's dignity, according to Hobbes, his "public worth," is constituted by how others actually value him, by how they honor him by "offices of command," through their deference to him, and by other public valuing conduct: "The manifestation of the value we set on one another, is that which is commonly called honouring, and dishonouring. To value a man at a high rate, is to *honour* him; at a low rate, is to *dishonour* him."18

Just as consumers' preference-revealing purchases determine prices in a free market, so also is there a market in Hobbesian public worth or

<sup>18</sup> Hobbes, *Leviathan*, X.17.

dignity, with deference and other forms of honoring playing the role of purchasing. Indeed, Hobbes says as much. "The *value,* or worth of a man, is as of all other things, his price; that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his power."19 Public patterns of honoring ("paying tribute") establish people's "prices" and thereby measure their Hobbesian worth and dignity.

Hobbes's concept of dignity offers a stark contrast to Kant's famous distinction between dignity and price, which, as we shall see, had an important precursor in Pufendorf.20 For Kant, the dignity of persons is an absolute value defined in opposition to any "relative" value that can be priced—human dignity is "infinitely above all price."21

Part of the reason that dignity as both Cicero and Kant conceive it differs from Hobbes's concept of dignity as social status is that the latter is a nonnormative social-economic fact, whereas for Cicero and Kant dignity is plainly normative. Even if certain rights and privileges were themselves part of an honored status, nothing would follow about whether these rights and privileges *should* be honored with the kind of respect that helps constitute the rights-including status as a social fact.22

Thus far, then, we face a dilemma. On the one hand, a Ciceronian conception of dignity as a standard we should live up to seems impotent to even bear on the question of right. Moreover, this is so even if, as Kant holds, that standard includes duties that require us to act toward others in ways we believe to be required by human rights. If the standard were to include such duties, the justification dignity would provide for complying with them would be that it would be beneath *our* dignity not to treat human persons in the required ways, not that

<sup>22</sup> Of course, there will often almost automatically be prudential reasons for doing so.

*their* dignity grounds *their* legitimate claims on us that we comply with these duties.

On the other hand, however, even if the very same rights we take to be basic human rights were to make up some honored status, any dignity consisting in that status would remain but a social fact, entailing only that others in fact relate to one *as if* one had these rights. It could not therefore ground the normative claim that anyone has these rights de jure. Dignity as a social construct can only generate rights de facto.

Recently, a number of writers, including Anthony Appiah and Jeremy Waldron, have called attention to historico-conceptual connections between dignity and honored status and have argued that the idea of human dignity is best framed within this context.23 Although dignity structured through deference and other forms of honoring treatment has historically been hierarchical, Waldron and Appiah suggest that it be subversively reconceived by, as it were, leveling everyone up to a place of honor that is structured by recognition and respect for the rights we take human dignity to involve or ground. Although orders of honor are usually hierarchical, structured by what Appiah calls "competitive honor," "peer honor" can also exist.24 Similarly, Waldron seconds a proposal he finds in an essay of Gregory Vlastos's: "that we organize ourselves not like a society without nobility or rank, but like an aristocratic society that has just one rank (and a pretty high rank at that) for all of us."25 In such a social order, "Everyone [would be] entitled to the sort of deference … in the way nobles were entitled to deference."26

There is much to recommend subversively reconceiving honor along egalitarian lines. However welcome such an approach might be for other reasons, however, it cannot successfully frame a conception of

dignity that can ground human rights. There are two main reasons for this. First, because honor and any dignity it can constitute are socially constructed social facts, any normative reasons for treating someone with honor and dignity, even if this involves according that person what we take to be human rights, must come from somewhere else. According to the idea we are tracking, human dignity and therefore rights derive from the nature of human beings or rational moral agents. For such a subversive reconception of honor to be successful, therefore, it would have to argue that there are good reasons, owing to the nature of human or rational moral agents, for according them this place of honor and, consequently, according them equal rights.

For our purposes, we can stipulate that this challenge can be met. Even if it can be, there will remain a second challenge that, in my view, such an approach cannot possibly meet. The reason has to do with a fundamental distinction between the kind of (recognition) respect that honor and socially constructed status involve, on the one hand, and the kind that is called for by human rights. I shall argue that (recognition) respect of the latter kind is essentially second personal (*second-personal respect*); it is an attitude that mediates forms of mutual accountability that are intrinsic to recognizing mutual rights and obligations. *Honor respect*, by contrast, is a form of deference that need not, and usually does not, engage second personally.

## The Second-Personal Character of Human Rights

To begin to make this argument, notice, first, second-personal aspects that are intrinsic to the very ideas of human rights and obligations that are correlative to them, as these notions began to be developed in the modern period, as I read the history, from Grotius on.27 The basic

<sup>27</sup> Stephen Darwall, "Grotius at the Creation of Modern Moral Philosophy," *Archiv für Geschichte der Philosophie* 94 (2012): 94–125. Also in Darwall, *Essays in Second-Personal Ethics*, vol. 2: *Honor, History, and Relationship* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013).

point is that rights of the relevant kind, moral claim rights, entail the (second personal) authority to make and hold others to demands of various kinds, so human dignity will be able ground such rights only if it includes or entails such an authority.

This point can be appreciated by reflecting on what it is to have a moral claim right. Consider an example I have often used—the right that one's feet not be stepped on without one's consent.28 It seems entirely possible for someone to avoid stepping on others' feet without regarding this as their right. A noble in an aristocratic order might see stepping on others' feet as ignoble or base, something that is beneath him. Clearly, in avoiding others' feet for this reason, he wouldn't be seeing it as anything to which anyone has a right. For that to be so, he would have to see others as having some authority to demand that he avoid their feet and to object and hold him to account if he does not.

Even, indeed, if he were to see stepping on someone else's foot as inconsistent with the *other's* honored status honored status, that might just mean that such treatment would treat him *below* his status, and thus be something he would naturally take as an insult and could be expected to resist and avenge if he was able, and indeed that would actually tend to lower his status, if he could not.

When the dignity of persons is called "inviolable" in documents like the *Grundgesetz*, that of course does not mean that it cannot be violated in actual fact. But crucially unlike honored statuses, when human dignity is violated, it is in no way diminished or lowered. Compare, in this way, an honored status that includes certain rights and privileges and that is constituted by patterns of public deference that signify treatment *as* having these rights, on the one hand, with the fundamental *normative* idea of the *Grundgesetz*: that because persons have equal dignity they have equal basic human rights de jure. If patterns of deference change, and people no longer recognize a status they formerly

<sup>28</sup> For example, in Darwall, *The Second-Person Standpoint*, 5.

recognized, then that status with whatever "rights" it might have included no longer exists de facto. But that does not affect whether rights exist de jure. According to the enlightenment idea expressed in the *Grundgesetz*, human rights are valid even when they are violated because the dignity that undergirds them cannot be diminished or lowered in the way that an honored status can be. It follows that such dignity must include a fundamental de jure authority that persons have to make claims and demands of one another and hold each other mutually accountable.

Hugo Grotius, whose *Rights of War and Peace* is a foundational work on human rights, highlights what I am calling the second-personal aspect of basic human rights, when he says that "perfect rights" include "a faculty of demanding what is due," which faculty "answers the obligation of rendering what is owing."29 And Joel Feinberg makes what I take to be the same point in the late twentieth century when he says, "It is claiming that gives rights their special moral significance."30 Without rights, although others might accept norms requiring them to treat us in certain ways, we could not claim this is as our right. We would have, as Feinberg says, no place to "stand, … look others in the eye," and make claims on them.31

It is thus part of the very idea of a human right—such as the right not to have our feet stepped on without our consent—that this is something we can demand from one another and to which we can legitimately hold each other. I call this authority "second personal," because it is a standing to *address* demands and hold one another accountable. Accountability is essentially relational in its nature, not just in the logical sense, but as involving *relatings* to persons that express distinctive second-personal, "reactive," holding-responsible attitudes that, as

<sup>31</sup> Feinberg, "Nature and Value," 151.

P. F. Strawson and a number of others have pointed out, have not just objects, but implicit *addressees*. 32

This, as I will illustrate further presently, is the fundamental difference between an order of honor and an order of rights involving mutual accountability. Even elevating everyone to the same high status as meriting the same honor, as Appiah and Waldron propose, cannot capture the notion, central to the idea of human rights, of fundamental *reciprocity* in the sense of mutual accountability. Citizens of a liberal democracy, or members of the moral community, are not just honor peers. They share not simply a common *status*, but also a common *authority* to make claims and demands of one another. They regard each other, in Rawls's words, as "self-originating sources of valid claims."33 What it is for persons or citizens to recognize one another's equal authority is thus for them to acknowledge it, second personally, by holding themselves answerable to one another for complying with legitimate claims and demands.

To put this one other way, respect for another human as an "equal citizen" or "moral person" with whom one shares a common basic dignity, is an attitude that inevitably calls for reciprocation—it comes, one might say, with an implicit RSVP. Whereas honor peers look *upon* each other as equals, mutually respecting citizens or moral subjects look *to* one another as equals with the expectation their look will be returned. Seeing ourselves as having rights against others enables us "to look others in the eye," and hold them accountable to us for their treatment of us, as we are to them for our treatment of them.

It follows that human rights can be grounded in the equal dignity of persons only if human dignity includes this second-personal,

Strawson, "Freedom and Resentment," in *Studies in the Philosophy of Thought and Action* (London: Oxford University Press, 1968); Gary Watson, "Responsibility and the Limits of Evil: Variations on a Strawsonian Theme," in *Responsibility, Character, and the Emotions: Essays in Moral Psychology*, ed.

See also Darwall, *The Second-Person Standpoint*.

reciprocating aspect. The dignity of persons cannot therefore consist in any form of merit warranting esteem, however high, or any higher status or greater value that warrants honor or deference, again, however high. These are all concepts of the wrong kind to ground the second-personal authority that human rights conceptually implicate.

## Honor Respect versus Second-Personal Respect

It will help to consolidate these differences between orders of right and honor (even one including the status of peer with the very same rights as part of that status) if we say more about the distinct forms of recognition respect, *honor respect* and *second-personal respect*, that respectively mediate these.34 Both honor and second-personal respect are forms of *recognition respect* rather than *appraisal respect*, which is a form of esteem for someone's conduct or character.35 Both are realized in our conduct toward someone or in an attitude that, unlike esteem, is essentially concerned with the regulation of conduct.

We have just seen how fundamental rights, and obligations that are correlative to them, have an ineliminable second-personal element. Consider the right every person has not to be trodden upon. This is held against every other person. Equivalently, every person is obligated *to* every other person not to tread on him or her. These equivalent moral facts, are irreducibly second personal because they entail the equal second-personal authority of right holders to engage those obligated to them (obligees) in various distinctive ways, to claim that to which they have the right, as Feinberg says, and to hold their obligees answerable for respecting their rights.36 This is reflected, for example, in the fact that the right holder may waive her right or

<sup>34</sup> Here I draw from Darwall, "Respect as Honor and as Accountability," in *Honor, History, and Relationship*.

<sup>35</sup> Darwall, "Two Kinds of Respect."

<sup>36</sup> These claims are more fully developed in Darwall, "Bipolar Obligation."

consent to what would otherwise violate it. Only she has this authority; others cannot waive it or consent for her. If her right is violated, even if others, or the state on their behalf, are in a position to blame her violator or hold him criminally responsible through legal punishment, the victim nonetheless has a distinctive authority others do not have to decide whether to seek compensation, to forgo it, or even to forgive her violator. This is why, in American courts, anyway, only the victim has standing to bring a tort action. It is thus part of the very idea of a fundamental claim right that the right holder has an *individual authority* to hold those against whom she holds the right personally accountable in these ways.

I call the form of respect that mediates an order of rights, as opposed to an order of honor, second personal for two reasons. First, as we have just noted, fundamental moral claim rights entail rights holders' second-personal authority to claim their rights from, and hold accountable, those against whom they are held. And second, authority of this kind can only be adequately recognized *second personally*, through relating *to* others in a way that *acknowledges* their second-personal authority. We realize second-person respect by relating *to* one another in ways that acknowledge each other's standing to demand, remonstrate, resist, charge, blame, resent, feel indignant, excuse, forgive, and so on. When others "look us in the eye" and claim their rights against us, we recognize their second-personal authority by looking back at them with acknowledgment.

As Strawson and others have argued, we hold people answerable through the distinctive second-personal attitudes that Strawson dubbed "reactive attitudes."37 Attitudes like indignation, resentment, blame, and guilt implicitly address demands to their objects and hold them accountable. They implicitly bid for reciprocating acknowledgment, and unlike purely retaliatory impulses, implicitly acknowledge

<sup>37</sup> Strawson, "Freedom and Resentment." See also Watson, "Responsibility"; Wallace, "Responsibility and Moral Sentiments"' and Darwall, *The Second-Person Standpoint*.

their object's standing as a fellow member of the moral community.38 Whereas retaliatory impulses are satisfied only by the other's harm, reactive attitudes can be satisfied through acknowledgment of wrongdoing, apology, and the violator's holding himself accountable.

Compare now the form of respect that mediates status and rank. We accord honor respect by publicly recognizing or supporting someone's social self-presentation or *persona*. By contrast, when we look down on people or fail to support their self-presentation with contempt or disdain, we tend to lower their social status. "Looking someone out of countenance" can cause him to lose "face," his persona or the social role he has been attempting to play.

Honor respect and contempt are contraries: they sort people up and down in a status hierarchy. Second-personal respect, however, does not have a true contrary. Since negative reactive attitudes like blame and resentment address their objects as fellow moral agents, they actually express second-personal respect. They are thus second personal, whereas contempt, which does not necessarily address its object at all, is third personal.

Consider the difference between a disdainful rolling of the eyes and a look that expresses resentment or indignation ("looking daggers"). The latter addresses its object (with an RSVP) in a way that the former need not. For example, consider the "staredown" that the Italian ice dancer Barbara Fusar Poli gave her partner Maurizio Margaglio after he dropped her during the ice-dancing competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. According to one account, "When the music stopped, the two stood facing each other for nearly a minute at center ice, Fusar Poli steaming as her eyes burned through Margaglio" (Macur 2006). Or as one caption had it: "Barbara Fusar Poli to partner Maurizio Margaglio: Look me in the eye and tell how you dropped me."39 Suppose, however,

<sup>38</sup> Strawson, "Freedom and Resentment," 93.

<sup>39</sup> In the Internet edition of the *San Diego Union-Tribune*. http://legacy.sandiegouniontribune. com/sports/olympics/20060220-9999-lz1x20falls.html.

that Fusar Poli had disdainfully rolled her eyes after the fall and skated off in disgust. Any expressive address in that instance would most likely have been to the *cognoscenti* off ice: "Can you believe what *he* just did?"

The psychologist John Gottman describes contempt as "speak[ing] from a higher plane" and as "closely related to disgust." "What disgust and contempt are about," he continues, "is completely rejecting and excluding someone from the community."40 Contempt can be internalized by its object as shame. To feel shame is to feel as if one is as one would seem to someone who viewed one with contempt: that is, contemptible or shameful. Contempt can thus lead to loss of face in two different ways. The first, we have already mentioned: contempt looks its object "out of countenance," thereby constituting its object's losing face in others' eyes. But consider, second, the natural expressions of internalized contempt or shame: blushing or hiding the face. These affect social self-presentation through the face quite literally. Whereas contempt excludes the other, a person feeling shame tends to exclude herself.

Notice how different the emotion that internalizes negative reactive attitudes like resentment and blame, namely guilt, is in this regard. Guilt is a felt acknowledgment of having violated some authoritative demand. If shame is the feeling of being as one would seem to someone who views one with contempt, guilt is the feeling of being as one would seem to someone who blames or resents one. It is the feeling that one has done something blameworthy and should be held, and that one should hold *oneself*, answerable for what one has done. Indeed, guilt partly constitutes holding oneself answerable. But whereas contempt and shame are exclusive, guilt is inclusive and engaging. Its natural expressions are second personal: acknowledgment of wrongdoing, apology, making amends, and self-addressed reproach.

<sup>40</sup> Quoted in Malcolm Gladwell, *Blink* (New York: Little Brown, 2005).

It is because of this fundamental difference between honor and second-personal respect that honor respect is not an attitude of the right kind to be responsive to any dignity that can bear on human rights. Subverting honor hierarchies and treating every person with peer honor, as Appiah proposes, cannot, consequently, amount to recognizing, much less acknowledging, any dignity that can ground basic rights. If human rights are, as I've argued, second personal in their nature, then they can only be recognized adequately by a second-personal attitude. It follows that if human dignity is, as Kant claimed, that by which a person "exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world," then both human dignity and the form of respect that responds to it must be second personal in their nature also.41

## Equal Dignity and Human Rights in Pufendorf

In this final section, I will illustrate this conclusion further with what might seem an unlikely source: the natural law theory of Samuel Pufendorf. Pufendorf is a theological voluntarist who holds that morality derives from God's superior command, so how could he possibly be a source of the idea we have been considering? According to Pufendorf, however, what God commands as the "fundamental law of nature" is that "every man, so far as in him lies, should cultivate a sociable attitude."42 "By a sociable attitude," he adds, "we mean an attitude of each man towards every other man, by which each is understood to be bound … by a mutual obligation."43 Our fundamental moral obligation, in other words, is to cultivate an attitude

<sup>41</sup> Immanuel Kant, *The Metaphysics of Morals*, in *Practical Philosophy*, 6:435.

<sup>42</sup> Samuel Pufendorf, *On the Law of Nature and Nations*, ed. C. H. Oldfather and W. A. Oldfather (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1934), 208. What follows draws from Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality, Sociability, and Moral Powers," *Journal of the History of Philosophy* 50 (2012): 213–38. Also in Darwall, *Honor, History, and Relationship*.

<sup>43</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 208.

through which we regard ourselves as morally bound, as equals, with every other person.

Since God's command is the source of morality, our most fundamental obligation is owed in the first instance to God. Even so, Pufendorf clearly holds that we comply with this obligation only if we hold ourselves obligated, and so answerable also, to every other human person. Human beings thus enjoy "an *equality of right*, which has its origin in the fact that an obligation to cultivate a social life is equally binding on all men, since it is an integral part of human nature as such."44 Because "human nature belongs equally to all men, and no one can live a social life with a person by whom he is not rated as a fellow man," it follows, as a precept of natural law, that "every man should esteem and treat another man as his equal by nature, or as much a man as he is himself."45 Mutual respect as equals is thus a corollary of the fundamental law of nature.

To regard others socially, consequently, is to see them as sharing a common basic standing with oneself that grounds or includes an ensemble of basic human rights to make demands of one another and hold each other to them. People "who, from a special feeling of their own superiority, would have every liberty reserved for themselves alone … and claim honor before other men," are "plainly unsocial."46

Sociability thus includes the recognition of all men as equally entitled to fundamental respect or, as Pufendorf usually puts it, "esteem." "Esteem of persons in communal life … consists in this, that [the other] is regarded as the kind of person with whom … it may be possible to have intercourse."47 "Intercourse," like "sociable," is a normatively loaded term for Pufendorf. Just as taking a "sociable attitude" toward

<sup>46</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 336.

<sup>47</sup> Samuel Pufendorf, *Two Books of the Elements of Universal Jurisprudence*, ed. Thomas Behne (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2009), 94.

someone is already viewing her as entitled to certain forms of treatment and to hold others to these, so likewise, to relate to someone as apt for "intercourse" is to recognize her as having this same fundamental dignity and thereby to respect (in Pufendorf 's words, "esteem") her, as an equal to whom one is accountable for complying with "mutual" obligation to her and so her correlative rights.

"Esteem" is, for Pufendorf, a form of valuation we uniquely apply to "persons" and their distinctive value: "the value of persons in common life."48 Esteem thus contrasts with the way "things" are valued. "In common life," Pufendorf says, persons are "valued by" esteem and things are valued by their "price," anticipating Kant's later distinction between dignity and price, but in a way that understands, perhaps more explicitly than Kant, esteem or respect for human dignity to be a form of second-personal sociability. To esteem or respect others in this sense is to regard them as having the standing for "intercourse" as equals.

In connecting up rights and dignity in this way, Pufendorf stands at the beginning of the line of thought that leads to the *Grundgesetz*. Human beings carry with them "a most sensitive self-esteem" and are "rarely less and often more disturbed" by disrespect for their dignity "than if an injury were being offered [to their] person and property."49 When one's person or property is violated, the injury is generally twofold, indeed, since some insult is at least implicitly added, and so a second injury of disrespect, to the primary injury. The "most telling reply with which the rude insults of other men is met is, 'I am not a dog or a beast, but as much a man as you are.'"50

Because of the connections between sociability, respect for equal dignity, and rights, arrogance "giv[es] occasion to a breach of peace."51

<sup>48</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 1229.

<sup>49</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 330.

<sup>50</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 330.

<sup>51</sup> Pufendorf, *Law of Nature and Nations*, 335–36.

Indeed, peace, for Pufendorf, just is the condition in which people acknowledge one another's dignity and rights.52 Therefore, anyone who, in word or deed, presumes a superiority over others that cannot itself be justified from a fundamental standpoint of equality, as, for example, the authority of a political official that is properly grounded in an agreement or "pact," undermines peace and threatens war. To be peaceful, one must treat others not as "inferiors," but as equal "men."53

In connecting the fundamental value of human moral agents, dignity, as we have come to call it, to basic rights and obligations via the (second personal) attitude of sociability, Pufendorf illustrates the point for which I have been arguing. Human dignity can bear directly on human rights only if it is capable of accounting for the second-personal character of these reciprocal rights and obligations. To ground the specific claims and demands that constitute specific human rights and obligations, the dignity of persons must either consist in or entail a shared (second personal) authority that can legitimate claim- and demand-making in general.

The European Enlightenment is remembered as an electric age of innovation—and understandably so. In everything from ethics, politics, government, and economics to science, medicine, industry, and technology, the spirit of progress burned feverishly hot for more than a hundred years (ca. 1650–1800). Old dogmas were challenged. Political systems were upended. Ancient morals were rethought. Even the idea of "enlightenment" came in for debate before it was all over.1

But alongside all this supposed progress there was a complicated reality. Alongside heated discussions of social justice, for example, the situation of women barely changed. Women remained disenfranchised

Alongside inspiring calls for religious toleration, "the Jewish question" was explicitly posed for the first time and bred a full-fledged discussion of how to solve the Jewish "problem."2 And alongside astonishing developments in technology and the rise of a new economic mindset that empowered the working class, there was a massive expansion of slavery. Granted, this expansion was followed by a decline in slavery during the second half of the century. But recent studies have shown that this decline had little to do with "enlightened" resistance to slavery.3 Thus, by the close of the eighteenth century the slave trade had returned to its old vigor, and by 1822 the number of slaves in the New World more than doubled from its eighteenth century peak.4

In short, the political and social realities of the Enlightenment were complicated. We should not be surprised, then, to learn that the same is true of the concept of human dignity that emerged from the period. And yet this conceptual complexity is not well appreciated today. This is largely because scholars interested in the idea of human dignity, and philosophers in particular, have focused on one Enlightenment thinker to the exclusion of almost all others, namely, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Indeed, Kant's famous dictate—that we must always treat "humanity" "at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"—is often treated as *the* wellspring of Enlightenment thought about human dignity.5 By contrast, this chapter will show that the

concept of dignity in the eighteenth century was actually older, more nuanced, more diverse, and ultimately more interesting than it is usually thought to be.

## Enter the French Architect

According to Kant, the normative ground of dignity—what justifies our duty to treat persons as ends in themselves—is our rational nature or autonomy. How intriguing, then, that it is precisely this claim about the ultimate appeal to rationality that Kant's predecessor, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), seems to set aside at the outset of his own seminal treatise in ethics, *Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men*. Rousseau writes, "It would seem that if I am obliged not to harm another being like myself, this is so less because it is a rational being than because it is a sentient (*sensible*) being."6

But what does Rousseau mean by "sentient"? And why think that his remark reflects a different Enlightenment view about human worth? That is, why think that it reflects a bona fide position on human dignity that diverges from Kant's rationalist one? Who were the proponents of this position? And what were its principles?

My inquiry will require moving back and forth between these questions and their answers. But as prelude, I offer the following summary. At one limit, Rousseau thought of sentience as entailing merely the capacity to suffer. However, Rousseau wasted little time fleshing this out to mean, *passionate* nature in general. Thus, although Rousseau is famous for theorizing the delusory powers of some passions (like envy and the other products of what he called *amoure propre*)—no careful reader

<sup>6</sup> Jean-Jacques Rousseau, *Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men* (1755), in *The Discourses and Other Early Political Writings*, ed. Victor Gourevitch (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 128. The quoted sentence continues, "a quality which, since it is common to beast and man, must at least give the beast the right not to be needlessly maltreated by man."

misunderstands that, for Rousseau, respecting others requires recognizing them as passionate persons. Moreover, in marking a positive place for the passions in moral life, Rousseau was only one voice among many. The eighteenth century was distinguished by an array of philosophical and literary work meant to recuperate the passions from their negative characterization in older philosophical and especially religious systems.7 And in some cases, this optimism about the passions led to a distinctive conception about human worth. Or better, because more precise, this optimism lead not simply to an *instrumental* defense of the value of passions—because, say, passion can be the proper motivational consequence of right reason—but instead, this optimism led to the view that the passions in some sense *constitute* one's fundamental moral worth.

And yet it is important to appreciate that this new perspective on human worth wasn't fashioned out of whole cloth. As I will argue, it was connected—at least in one important case—to a concrete account of human dignity penned well before Kant, namely, in the seventeenth-century natural law theory of Samuel Pufendorf (1632– 1694). Indeed, Pufendorf waxed so powerfully poetic about the moral status of human beings, one wonders how his historical pride of place is not better known. In any event, as I will argue in the final sections, it turns out that when we cast our gaze forward, *from* Pufendorf *to* the eighteenth century, we find a version of Pufendorf 's view in the French Enlightenment, but with this important difference: the view is revised to make room for the idea of the passionate person. Perhaps equally surprising, given my lead-up to this point, is that this "Pufendorfian" defense of human dignity doesn't come from Rousseau. It comes from Rousseau's compatriot, the great architect of the *Encyclopédie*, Denis Diderot (1713–1784).

<sup>7</sup> Professional philosophy remains less than ideally receptive to the role literature played (and continues to play) in furthering philosophical thought. This must change because literature is where many minority voices find their place. The story I tell here is thus necessarily incomplete. However, other chapters in this volume do address the role of literature. See also Lynn Festa's *Sentimental Figures of Empire in Eighteenth Century Britain and France* (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2006).

## A Formal Definition of "Dignity"

Before we dig too deep, we must consider a potential obstacle. Prior to the translation of Kant's *Groundwork* into English, and specifically Kant's term *Würde* as "dignity," the term "dignity" had no currency as anything like "the fundamental moral worth had by all humans." (This is true both for the English term and its Latin and French counterparts.) This *moralized* connotation of the term—which is the connotation of "dignity" I am interested in—didn't exist until the very end of the century.8 Instead, in everything from Hobbes's *Leviathan* (1651) to Samuel Johnson's *Dictionary* (1755), the term "dignity" was dominated by a conventional *merit* connotation: it meant something like high social rank.9 The potential problem, then, is that my inquiry seems to risk anachronism. That is, it might seem anachronistic to search for a theory of dignity before Kant, given that prior to Kant, the term "dignity" simply didn't refer to a person's fundamental moral worth.

I am tempted to say that this worry is simply overanxious. Kant himself indicated earlier sources for his ideas about human dignity and respect. Indeed, he paid high praise to Rousseau on exactly this point.10 Kant also credited the ancient Stoics for influencing his view

<sup>8</sup> The earliest translators of Kant, Abbot (1895) and Paton (1947), both translate *Würde* with "dignity," as does John Richardson (who was also the earliest translator of *Religion within the Bounds of Reason*)—although, as Oliver Sensen pointed out to me, in the recent Cambridge translation of Kant's lectures on ethics, Heath translates *Würde* sometimes as "dignity" and sometimes as "worth" (Immanuel Kant, *Lectures on Ethics*, ed. J. B. Schneewind, trans. Peter Heath [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001]).

<sup>9</sup> Johnson defines dignity as "rank of elevation." "Page View, Page 591." *A Dictionary of the English Language: A Digital Edition of the 1755 Classic by Samuel Johnson*, ed. Brandi Besalke, last modified, December 6, 2012.

<sup>10</sup> "Rousseau set me right about this," Kant famously remarked. "I learned to honor humanity" (AK 20:44, cited by Allen Wood in his "General Introduction" to Kant, *Practical Philosophy*, xvii). For a very good primer on Rousseau's influence, see George Armstrong Kelly, "Rousseau, Kant, and History," *Journal of the History of Ideas* 29, no. 3 (1968): 347–64. For a more recent entry into this scholarship, which takes up the question of Kant's novelty, see Karl Ameriks, *Kant's Elliptical Path*, especially the chapter "Kant, Human Nature, and History after Rousseau" (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2012), 29–45.

of respect.11 Thus it seems we already have an invitation from Kant to look before Kant, for a "Kantian" concept of dignity. On the other hand, I concede that the lack of terminological signposts is a challenge. We need a marker other than the term "dignity" to alert us to a live discussion of the concept of dignity in pre-Kantian thought. We need, in other words, a *formal* definition of dignity.

By this I mean we need a definition that abstracts away from all *substantive* claims about what it is in human nature that makes it true that we have dignity.12 For example, Kant's claim that we have dignity in virtue of our rational autonomy is a substantive claim. By contrast, a formal definition of dignity will identify the general conceptual features or conditions that apply to any such substantive claim. For example, regardless of what we think makes it true that we have dignity (such as autonomy), dignity is often said to be something humans don't earn. If we accept this claim, then this feature of being "unearned" would be formal. As such, it would serve as a constraint on any substantive claim. Thus one might sensibly say, "I'm not sure what it is about being human that makes it true that we have dignity. Maybe it is our capacity for rationality. Maybe it is something else. But whatever it is, it better be something we don't have to earn. Or I won't call it dignity."

To be clear, the formal features of dignity we select will be stipulated in the sense that they will be drawn explicitly from our contemporary use of the term. But this is precisely the point. If we articulate a formal definition in this way, then these conceptual features, and not the actual term, can serve as signposts for historical inquiry. That is, we can use these formal features to determine whether anything like our present-day moralized concept of dignity existed *before* this concept

<sup>11</sup> "These philosophers," Kant once noted, "derived their universal moral principle from the dignity of human nature, from its freedom (as an independence from the power of the inclinations), and they could not have laid down a better or nobler principle for foundation" (*Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason*, trans. and ed. Allen Wood and George Di Giovanni [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998], AK 6:57n). Oliver Sensen makes this point in *Kant on Human Dignity* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2011), 165.

<sup>12</sup> This paragraph repeats a similar one in my introduction to this volume.

was reliably *called* "dignity." In short, following this approach avoids anachronism, or at least greatly mitigates it.

So what are the general conceptual conditions of the concept of dignity, as we use this concept today?13 Answering questions like this is always contentious given that it is always a further question who the relevant "we" is, that is being used to guide the answer. I can only hope my own assumptions will seem plausible. They are as follows: First, the primary interest of this inquiry is human persons and human dignity. Thus, if any claims we discover about dignity in early Enlightenment thought extend to animals, let alone plants or rocks—well, this would be a fortuitous result for them. But as a formal matter, we can start with our intuitions about the value of being human. Second, and following from the first, talk of human dignity seems connected to an enduring and literally ancient intuition that to be human entails some kind of *distinctive* value—though not necessarily a unique value.14

In light of these starting assumptions, I propose the following roughand-ready formal definition: "Dignity" (as a concept) purports to identify the existence of a kind of moral community between humans, the "membership" of which is unearned and normatively privileged.15 Let me unpack this, first with two clarifications to show how it answers to the starting intuitions, and then with a few elaborations.

First clarification: The intended domain of the concept is the human community, but this does not amount to speciesism. The definition does *not* say we have dignity just because we are human. The

<sup>13</sup> I have defended the methodology I'm following in this section at greater length in Remy Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," *Philosophical Perspectives* 23 (2009): 46–78.

<sup>14</sup> Granted, since antiquity many have leveraged this intuition about "distinctiveness" into the idea that humans are supremely valuable (at least, among "created" things), but vindicating the intuition of distinctiveness doesn't entail this further move. And given that we are trying to shape a tool for historical excavation, a thinner formal definition is preferable.

<sup>15</sup> One might wonder whether this definition applies to honor as well. The relation between dignity and honor is complex, and not something I can take up here. Moreover, I think the conditions I go on to spell out below mitigate the worry that my definition is too broad.

definition says that what dignity is, is a kind of moral status humans attribute to each other. And it says something formal about the nature of that status, namely, that it is unearned and normatively privileged. It also makes no claim about *what it takes* to have that status, except in one obvious negative sense: Having dignity does not depend on any conventional membership status such as state citizenship. For, such membership would be in plain tension with the idea that the status is unearned.

Second clarification: According to the formal definition, dignity is not just a descriptive concept. It is a concept with a practical purpose or function. Understood loosely, this function is to "set off " in our practical deliberations whatever dignity is ascribed to. That is, when we are deliberating about whether to do this or that, or to say this or that, and so on, the concept of dignity is somehow supposed to guard or protect whatever one thinks has dignity. At any rate, this is what the designation of a "normatively privileged" status is meant to do, and in turn, how this definition is meant to satisfy the second starting assumption about dignity being a distinctive value. What has dignity is supposed to get distinctive *treatment* when we think about how to act with respect to what has it.

What kind of treatment? To answer this, consider again the formal claim that dignity is unearned. I propose that we understand this to mean that the status in question is in no way elected or bequeathed by other persons. One doesn't achieve, win, or acquire this status in any sense that is essentially dependent on the goodwill, intentions, or attitudes of another. In other words, if your having dignity would in any way require you to praise, congratulate, or in any sense show gratitude *back* toward the person recognizing your dignity, then the theory in question would not be correct. Call this the "no backward merit" condition.16

<sup>16</sup> See again, Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet."

The no-backward-merit condition makes the meaning of "unearned" essentially relational, or interpersonal. And this underlines a crucial feature of the account I'm offering. As I noted earlier, human dignity is a value that earns its conceptual distinctiveness from the demands it places on how we treat one another. In the light of the no-backward-merit condition, we can now elaborate this thought by saying that what human dignity *is* partly depends on, or is defined by, how other people *respond* to it. We simply cannot make sense of the kind of value that dignity is, outside of an interpersonal context. Unlike an ice cream cone, which might be relished were it and some person the only objects in existence, dignity requires mention of another person. Or, as I've put this point elsewhere, "dignity" comes to life within the interpersonal, even if only imagined: in the café, classroom, clinic, court, combat zone, or closet.17 If this sounds plausible, then the following final point should tie all the formal features together.

The usual way to account for the interpersonal nature of dignity is in terms of attitudes of respect. In other words, dignity is often said to be the fitting or proper object of respect. But not any kind of respect will do. It can't be the kind of respect one shows for the *merit* that one estimates a person or object to have. Such "appraisal respect," as it is sometimes called, is what we might show while gazing at Van Gogh's *Starry Night*, or what an apprentice metalworker shows to the master smithy. This kind of respect is earned, and hence not an appropriate response to dignity. Instead, dignity demands what is sometimes called "recognition respect." Recognition respect is the proper *deliberative deference* given to another entity in virtue of that entity's status.18 Thus, if humans have dignity, then the correct or fitting response

<sup>17</sup> Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," 67.

<sup>18</sup> I've framed the concept of recognition respect in a way that highlights its relevance to persons. But as Stephen Darwall first introduced the concept in his essay "Two Kinds of Respect," *Ethics* 88, no. 1 (1977): 36–49, recognition respect had greater generality, namely, as a disposition to give appropriate consideration in one's practical deliberation to another person or thing in virtue of some fact about it.

to humans—the correct interpersonal attitude for each of us to have toward one another—is to take measures not to overlook each other in our practical deliberations about what to do, or say, and so on. But also, we must take such measures precisely because of the unearned, privileged status each of us has. These are the formal conditions we seem to hold ourselves to when we talk of dignity in its moralized sense.

Our question has thus become: Is there any pre-Kantian Enlightenment account of human worth that satisfies the formal definition of dignity just articulated?

## "I Am Not a Dog": Samuel Pufendorf's Account of Dignity

In the background of Enlightenment moral philosophy was a debate over what today is known as theological voluntarism—the view that God wills laws that bind all humans equally, but that God's will is not itself bound by these laws. Voluntarism came to the fore during the Protestant Reformation, and took its lead from the doctrine of total human depravity defended by Martin Luther and John Calvin. On this doctrine, human nature is utterly corrupt both in reason and in will. We are not only overcome with selfish and corrupt motives (will), we also can never hope to understand God's will by dint of our own dim intellect (reason). Indeed, the only reason we are able to grasp for following morality, many voluntarists claimed, is the threat of God's sanctions, which sanctions God has attached to his laws.

Now, importantly, by the time Samuel Pufendorf came onto the scene, an alternative to this Protestant view was already on offer, namely in the form of Hugo Grotius's (1583–1645) natural law philosophy. Grotius argued that despite our selfishness—or better, essentially in tension with that selfishness—we are also naturally sociable. In Grotius's words, all humans have "an impelling desire

for society."19 In particular, we inherently desire a peaceful society. Furthermore, Grotius advocated a more optimistic view of our (human) capacity to understand moral laws. Grotius thus ended up positioned against Reformation voluntarism and the pessimistic view of human nature that undergirded it. For the same reason, Grotius became a source of inspiration for many more optimistically minded moralists of the Enlightenment like Shaftesbury, David Hume, Diderot, and Adam Smith.

But there was a problem with Grotius's break from voluntarism: for all its optimism, it jeopardized morality. Although the claim of innate sociability injected a motivational source for morality, it remained unclear why we *should* choose prosocial or altruist motives *over* private, selfish interests. Grotius's own attempt to answer this worry turned on a realist conception of natural human rights, which he argued supplied reasons to constrain or act against our selfish motives. The question was, why think that such rights-based reasons "trump" reasons derived from self-interest? That is, even if we beleive that such rights "really" exist—it isn't clear why we must, morally, defer to rights claims when these claims conflict with our private interests. Indeed, this was precisely the kind of question Pufendorf pressed against Grotius in *The Whole Duty of Man* (1735). Nothing in Grotius's account, Pufendorf argued, can get us to the kind of moral necessity Grotius argued for. Only the notion of *command*, Pufendorf claimed, could carry that kind of trumping authority.20 Or, as Jean Barbeyrac, Pufendorf 's

NB: This text is based on the 1735 edition of Andrew Tooke's English translation. Tooke's first translation of 1691 was from the original Latin version of *De officio*, published in 1673. However, Tooke's translation was thereafter modified by anonymous editors in light of Barbeyrac's own translation into French in 1707 and subsequent commentaries to produce the 1735 edition. Hunter and Saunders provide careful commentary on these changes. I have also made relevant comparisons to the more recent translation: Samuel Pufendorf, *On the Duty of Man and Citizen According to Natural Law*, ed. James Tully, trans. Michael Silverthorne (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991). I have not, however, found critical differences in the passages I quote, which are from the Liberty Fund edition.

eighteenth-century defender, put the same point: "To speak exactly, the duty and obligation, or the indispensable necessity of conforming to these ideas, and maxims [about social life] necessarily supposes a superior power, a supreme master of mankind."21 In short, Pufendorf retreated to voluntarism. Indeed, *every* moral property, Pufendorf elsewhere claimed, ultimately depends on the imposition of natural law through God's supremely authoritative will.22

Unfortunately for Pufendorf, his commitment to voluntarism ran over into politics. Thus, although Pufendorf formally endorsed the idea that individual will and consent are the principles of political legitimacy, he allied with Hobbes on the particular point of absolute sovereignty to solve the question of political authority. In the increasingly tolerant and secular atmosphere of eighteenth-century Europe, especially Britain and France, this struck many as regressive. When it came to politics, next-century liberals like Diderot, Hume, and Smith thought as their contemporary Sophie de Grouchy did, when she condemned "the pretended rights" of the despot: "As if reason could approve leaving to a sovereign (who, sometimes, can be a tyrant) no other restraint than his remorse, the progress of Enlightenment, or the despair of his victims … as if reason could permit any power whatsoever originally established in the common interest to become a source of tyrannical privilege and a license for immunity for its holders!"23

Stephen Darwall emphasizes the same point I'm making here. Darwall adds that, according to Pufendorf, not even "good repute and turpitude can be conceived to exist before law, and without the imposition of a superior" (LNNO, 27; quoted in Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 215).

The attentive reader will notice I have left out Rousseau. This is because Rousseau's position is complicated. Outward appearances suggest he also would have no truck with despotism, but certain aspects of his arguments come into tension with these first impressions.

In short, none of these thinkers had much truck with Pufendorf 's conclusions.

And yet Pufendorf made a crucial innovation on the idea of human worth—one that, as we will see, had a lasting if hitherto unappreciated influence. In a recent illuminating analysis, Stephen Darwall notes a crucial distinction in Pufendorf 's discussion of obligation, namely, between (1) our obligation to comply with laws of nature "in general"; and (2) what Darwall calls our "mutual (bipolar) human obligations."24 To reiterate, Pufendorf thinks the normative force of the former obligation depends entirely on God's supreme will. However, Darwall, argues, the latter obligation is partly conceptually independent of such voluntarism. Two elements are at work, as Darwall sees it. On the one hand, Pufendorf allies with Grotius on the question of sociability. Thus, Darwall writes: "Both understand *socialitas* as essentially involving *relationships* that are already conceived in terms of mutual recognition of individuals' respective authorities or normative "powers," that is, in terms of their capacities to have obligations to and rights against one another."25 On the other hand, and unlike Grotius, Darwall continues, "an essential aspect of Pufendorf 's theory … is that mutual perfect obligations are tied to a view of the equal *dignity* of any being capable of sociability and, accordingly, to the idea that persons share a basic authority over themselves and their own lives."26

Within Pufendorf 's theory, then, Darwall suggests there is an argument that runs roughly as follows: Human beings have perfect natural human rights (rights owed to one another) in virtue of a certain moral standing that we reciprocally assign one another, namely, the standing to make rights claims to or against one another. And we assign this standing as a constitutive part of being sociable, which sociability nature commands us to cultivate. In other words, part of being

<sup>24</sup> Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 221.

<sup>25</sup> Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 215.

<sup>26</sup> Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 216.

sociable involves *assuming* the other has this peculiar status. For, on the one hand, insofar as we hold others accountable for any actions that affect us or others, we intrinsically conceive of them as having what Pufendorf called a "moral power," namely, we acknowledge them as moral causes. And, on the other hand, it is a natural law to be sociable, that is, to enter into relationships of accountability.27

The upshot of Darwall's analysis is not only a revision of Grotius's view of sociability, but also the implication of a bona fide concept of human dignity. Consider: For Grotius, our sociability—our "impelling desire for society"—was the grounds of rights and obligations. By contrast, for Pufendorf sociability—"being sociable"—is the content of the fundamental law of nature. And "being sociable" just is to see others as accountable beings.28 Thus Pufendorf writes of "sociability" in *Of the Law of Nature and Nations*: "We mean an attitude of each man towards every other man, by which each is understood to be bound to the other by kindness, peace, and love, and therefore by a mutual obligation" (LNNO, 208). In other words, being sociable means having a particular practical *perspective*: a sociable person sees others as *moral agents*, namely, as beings who have rights against herself, and, consequently, as beings she thinks of herself as obligated toward. Indeed, Pufendorf goes on to conclude that "since it is an integral part of human nature as such" to cultivate this perspective, human beings enjoy an "equality of right" (LNNO, 333). And in so saying, Pufendorf puts into place the last piece of a concept akin to our contemporary notion of dignity.29 Thus notice that Pufendorf has now satisfied our formal criteria. He has delivered a concept of a moral status or standing

<sup>27</sup> The foregoing is a condensed summary of Darwall's main argument in "Pufendorf on Morality."

<sup>28</sup> As Darwall puts it, mutual obligations are already "built into" sociability on Pufendorf 's view ("Pufendorf on Morality," 222).

<sup>29</sup> Darwall reaches the same conclusion. He writes, "A sociable attitude, as Pufendorf understands it, includes mutual respect for one another's equal dignity as men. It is a 'precept of natural law,' therefore, that everyone should '*permit others to enjoy the same right that he himself does*'" (Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 223, quoting Pufendorf, LNNO, 336). Granted, the last line from Pufendorf might bother us, inasmuch as it speaks of "permission" where we might hope for a connotation of "entitlement"—at least, if dignity is to meet the criterion of being unearned. In fact, there is no obstacle here. On Pufendorf 's view "sociable" is a normative concept. Thus, being sociable *requires* mutual "permission" of status between agents. Thus, anyone who does not so "permit" others this status, for whatever reason, is unsocial and thus in violation of natural law (see Pufendorf, LNNO, 336).

with normative privilege (it grounds rights claims), which is unearned (it is assumed as a constitutive part of any social relationship). In fact, in one of his most poetic expressions, which I shall refer to as his "dignity dictate," Pufendorf even uses the actual term "dignity," thus marking the first time in the modern era the term was used to connote a systematic concept of dignity as we think of it today:

There seems to him to be somewhat of *Dignity* (*dignatio*) in the appellation of Man: so that the last and most efficacious Argument to curb the Arrogance of insulting Men, is usually, *I am not a Dog, but a Man as well as your self*. Since then Human Nature is the *same* in us all, and since no Man will or can cheerfully join in Society with any, by whom he is not at least to be esteemed equally a Man and a Partaker of the same Common Nature: It follows that, among those *Duties which Men owe to each other*, this obtains the *second* place, That *every Man esteem and treat another*, as naturally *equal to himself*, *or as one who is a Man as well as he*. (I.VII.1, 100)

Pufendorf 's advocacy of equal dignity in this passage, as well as his use of the actual term "dignity" to make his argument, all long before Kant, is remarkable. However, it was not beyond rebuke or revision, and for reasons separate from its voluntarist underpinning.

In the first place, there is Pufendorf 's inglorious attitude toward slavery, which at the very least amounted to permission. "It is also the Practice," Pufendorf wrote in his explicit discussion of masters and servants, "to pass away our Property in such *Slaves* who are taken in War, or bought with our Money, to whom we please, after the same manner as we do our other Goods and Commodities; so that the *Body of such Servant* is holden to be a Chattel of his Master" (II.IV.5, 186).

And although Pufendorf recalls his own claims about dignity at this precise moment, it is precisely the fact that dignity is not offered up as the grounds of abolition, but only a mere side constraint, that should distress us. Thus, he writes:

And yet here *Humanity* bids us not forget that this Servant is a Man, however, and therefore ought not to be treated as we do our Moveables, use 'em or abuse 'em, or destroy 'em as we list. And when we are minded to part with him, we ought not to deliver him into the Hands of such, as we know will abuse him inhumanly and undeservedly. (II.IV.5, 186)

No doubt in his own mind, Pufendorf spoke righteously here. But set next to the poetics of the original dignity dictate, it is hard not to cringe over these words.30

There was also this: Pufendorf 's view left little space for the passionate person. That is, he left little space to think moral agency by which I simply mean whatever capacity or capacities a person requires to be a bona fide moral agent—is positively constituted by, or founded on, human passionate nature. According to Pufendorf, having the requisite status of dignity required a certain kind of agency, namely, one that involves the ability to enter into mutualclaiming relationships. As I put the point before, being sociable for Pufendorf amounts to a certain practical "perspective": the sociable person sees others as moral agents themselves, as beings who have rights against oneself, and, consequently, as beings one thinks of herself as obligated toward. The "consequently" in this statement now

<sup>30</sup> Pufendorf 's contradictory permission, or at least tolerance, for slavery unfortunately was not an explicit reason motivating the next wave of dignity proponents toward revision of his view. Frankly, only Diderot speaks at length or with great passion on the subject. Thus, though he didn't pick out Pufendorf explicitly, Diderot can be credited with a sustained and spirited attack on colonial racism and slavery, delivered in his *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville,* which I return to later.

looms large. For it highlights the *rational* sense of agency at work. Sociable agency, according to Pufendorf, involves (1) seeing others as (that is, assuming them to be) claim makers; and (2) a conjoined if tacit recognition that this "power" to make claims is shared in common. In short, one recognizes others as claim makers like oneself. But, of course, to make claims is to exercise a distinctly rational capacity. It is thus a distinctly rational "aspect" of agency, we might say, that we recognize in others when we are properly sociable according to Pufendorf.

It is thus crucial that it is precisely this kind of claim about moral agency that Diderot, Rousseau, Smith, and De Grouchy challenged. To these later thinkers we are not simply rational agents; we are also passionate agents. In particular, moral agency requires certain affective capacities. And crucially, these capacities are not merely the executors of reason's will. Passion feeling, emotion, sentiment—these are not simply vehicles for motivation.31 Instead, agency itself is in some sense *constituted* by emotion and passion or the corresponding dispositions. In other words, passion partly structures, at a substantive level, our agency. And this "passionate" aspect of human agency bears fundamentally on any claim about human dignity. Correspondingly, any theory that resolves the substantive nature of human dignity into only rational terms like autonomy, or in Pufendorf 's case, claim-making, is impoverished. Likewise, whatever duty we have to respect other persons in virtue of their dignity, this duty must involve respecting persons as emotional agents, not simply as rational agents. Or so I'm suggesting all these various thinkers would have inclined. But let's begin drawing the circle in, specifically toward Diderot.

<sup>31</sup> In this chapter I take the liberty of treating these terms synonymously. I duly note, however, that the term "emotion" was only just emerging in the eighteenth century, and, moreover, that terms like "passion," "emotion," "sentiment," "affection," and "feeling" were not synonymous even if distinctions between them were becoming harder to parse. See Thomas Dixon, *From Passions to Emotions: The Creations of a Secular Psychological Category* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).

## Thoughts of the Heart

The Enlightenment had many hearts. One of these was undoubtedly the *Encyclopédie*—the ambitious, deeply controversial, nearly aborted eighteen-volume anthology of science and philosophy, published between 1751 and 1772, and orchestrated almost single-handedly by Diderot.32 It was a project that itself had many hearts, one of which was the officially anonymous entry "Le Philosophe," often remembered for its grand proclamation, "Reason is to the *philosopher* what grace is to the Christian."33 How interesting, then, that "Le Philosophe" also goes on to express skepticism of abstract reason. In particular, it rejects ancient rationalist conceptions of human practical nature and their usual deprecating view of passion. The Stoic *sage insensible* is no man, Le Philosophe says, only a *fantôme*. The time to rethink the value and role of passions had arrived in Europe.

This rehabilitation of passion took different forms depending on the target. Sometimes the goal was to reform passion's oft-claimed status as the rabble rouser to reason; sometimes it was the Socratic and Stoic view of passion as the handmaiden of right reason (a view recast by Spinoza and Leibniz in the modern world); and still other times it was the view of passion as the wellspring of vice, typical of medieval Christian and Reformation Protestant conceptions of human nature.34 The cumulative upshot might roughly be divided into two categories, which, while not mutually exclusive, were also not mutually entailing.

<sup>32</sup> Its full title was *Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers* (*Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts*). In the early stages, Le Rond d'Alembert was also centrally involved, though even then the driving force was still Diderot.

<sup>33</sup> Anonymous, "Le Philosophe," in *Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de letters*, eds. D. Diderot and M. d'Alembert, 36 vols., vol. 12 (1766, but originally ca. 1743) (Lausanne: Société typographique, 1778–81).

<sup>34</sup> The scholarship in this respect is now quite large. The most influential early voices included Peter Gay, Susan James, and Jonathan Israel. More recently, Dixon's *From Passions to Emotions* deserves mention. With respect to reform of religious attitudes, it took on a political dimension that was especially pronounced in France, where the spirit of toleration had not yet prevailed, and which was thus straining against the yoke of repressive Christian policies that were tied tightly to entrenched views about the corrupting effects of human passion. See also note 38.

On the one hand, there was a general rethinking of the utility of emotion for morality. For example, Shaftesbury introduced the idea of a moral sense that worked through felt sentiments; Hutcheson extended this moral sense theory to a vigorous defense of benevolence as a moral motive; Voltaire defended the moral innocence of sexual desire and passion; Rousseau argued that some corrupting passions like envy were social products and not part of original human nature; and so on. On the other hand, there was an effort to make a more fundamental reform, namely, to produce the idea of the passionate person—or more exactly, the idea of passionate agency (though I'll hereon use these terms synonymously).

At its limit, the idea of the passionate person was advanced together with a claim that passions were the essence of human nature. La Rochefoucauld (1613–1680), for example, who published his *Maximes* in 1665 and was quoted in "Le Philosophe," asserted that reason is neither the magistrate nor essence of humans. On his view, we are instead essentially passionate creatures. Admittedly, Rochefoucauld was also pessimistic about the moral upshot of the passions.35 However, the same kind of essentialist claim was reiterated in the early eighteenth century with marked optimism by the Marquis de Vauvenargues (1715–1747). According to Vauvenargues, the passions make us who we are: "Nos passions ne sont pas distinctes de nous-memes."36 But also, and crucially, the passions are responsible for our virtues, and not just

It is also worth mentioning that many of these efforts found inspiration in a related optimism about human sociability sparked by Grotius. For more about this specific connection, see Michael Gill, *The British Moralists on Human Nature and the Birth of Secular Ethics* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011); T. J. Hochstrasser and P. Schröder, eds., *Early Modern Natural Law Theories: Contexts and Strategies in Early Enlightenment* (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003); and Knud Haakonssen, *Natural Law and Moral Philosophy: From Grotius to the Scottish Enlightenment* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996).

<sup>35</sup> This is evidenced straightaway by the epigraph to *Maximes*, "Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised"—a subtitle that must remind us of another great antagonist of the rational agent, Bernard Mandeville.

<sup>36</sup> Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, *Introduction à la connaissance de l'esprit humain*, in *Oeuvres de Vauvenargues*, ed. D.-L. Gilbert (Paris: Furne et Cie, 1857), 31.

for brute motivation. For Vauvenargues, the "noblest" of our thoughts arise *from* the passions: "Les grandes pensées viennent du coeur."37 This "radical" view was mirrored by some British thinkers, most notably, David Hume (1711–1776). Thus Hume claimed that, on the one hand, belief was itself ultimately just a peculiar kind of feeling; and, on the other hand, "reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions." Granted, Hume's skepticism (which was also radical) probably makes it risky to call him an "essentialist" about human passionate nature, like Rochefoucauld or Vauvenargues, but he clearly still advanced an optimistic idea of the passionate person.

As for Diderot, his motives to recuperate the passionate person were wound up with a growing conviction in materialism. Diderot was in the intimate company of materialist thinkers, including especially Baron d'Holbach, whose personal influence on the French salon culture of the day is legend. In particular, as the historian Jonathan Israel has meticulously demonstrated, Holbach was a central player in fanning a kind of Spinozist crush among the Parisian philosophes, which quickened their interest in materialism.38 Also of special importance for Diderot, as Israel points out, were a number of evolutionary works circulating in that scene. These works had gleaned from Abraham Trembley's 1744 work, as Israel puts it, "the implication that nature has the power to create" (746). In particular, there was Maupertuis's *Dissertation Physique à l'occasion du Nègre Blanc* (1744), a work with moderate evolutionary musings, Buffon's *Histoire naturelle* (1749), a work with rather more explicit evolutionary implications, and La Mettrie's *L'Homme machine* (1748), a work of great notoriety in the early days of work on the *Encyclopédie* for its materialist, Spinozist, and atheistic daring. Indeed, the dangerous backlash La Mettrie faced for his book

<sup>38</sup> Interestingly, both Diderot and Holbach rarely refer explicitly to Spinoza. This is easily explained by the fact that his works were forbidden in France, and Israel provides too much conceptual evidence to ignore. Still, the fact should be noted, as Israel himself glosses over it.

probably explains why, when Diderot—who was familiar with all these works—did get around to expressing his materialist-cum-evolutionist views in the first volume of the *Encyclopédie* (1751), he did so slyly. For example, Diderot amended Chamber's 1728 *Cyclopaedia* definition of *naturalist* as "person who studies nature," to include the claim, "One also gives the name naturalist to those who do not admit God, but one who believes that there is only one material substance."39 Or consider that it was not through an entry on human or man but animal (coauthored with Daubenton) that Diderot chose to be his early vehicle to express materialism. Indeed, the entry "Animal" is little more than a reprisal of Buffon's treatise on generation from *Histoire naturelle*, with interspersed comments. Diderot even reproduced Buffon's conclusion without change: "that living and animation, instead of being a metaphysical degree of being, is [are] a physical property of matter."40

In the light of such materialism, it is no longer surprising that Diderot—or any of the French philosophes for that matter—attempted a moral recuperation of the passions. As Jonathan Israel writes, "For those aspiring to what Condorcet would eventually articulate clearly as an overturning *through* reason of authority, credulity, and tradition, in favor of liberty, toleration, equality, and a fully secular conception of the cosmos and humanity—a new materialist conception of human nature was crucial. From this perspective, the foregrounding of human sensuality and sensibility is not surprising"41—though, as a point of order, Diderot's optimism about the passions, and specifically the idea

Roe further notes that Diderot read Buffon in prison during his notorious three-month stay at Vicennes in 1749. Diderot later befriended Buffon, who was supposed to write the article "Nature" for the *Encyclopédie*, but never did. Instead, it was authored by the moderate D'Alembert.

<sup>41</sup> Jonathan Israel, *Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 504. Indeed, in retrospect it no longer seems a perfectly apt statement to say, as the famous Enlightenment scholar Ernst Cassirer does, "It sounds like a violent revolution when Vauvenargues in his *Introduction to the Knowledge of the Human Mind* (1746), says that the true nature of man does not lie in reason, but in the passions" (*The Philosophy of the Enlightenment* [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1951], 107). Cassirer is probably right only if we are thinking of the early modern lay reader, and probably wrong if speaking of the learned crowd.

of the passionate person, probably took root before his materialism. His very first published work was a translation of Shaftesbury's *Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit*, a work that was famous across Europe for arguing that virtue consists in an "economy of the passions," and was to become the fountain of all Scottish sentimentalism. And, in his notes to this translation, Diderot compared a man without passions to a musical instrument whose strings had been cut, or which never had any—a very Shaftesburian view.42

In any event, by the time he was engaged with the *Encyclopédie*, Diderot had clearly settled into a positive view of the passions. For example, his entry "Passions" argues that, even if our agency is sometimes subverted and made "passive" by very strong feelings, it is nevertheless through feelings or sentiments of desire and aversion, pleasure and pain that we come to call anything "good" or "evil" in the first place. Moreover, in the same entry Diderot allows for pleasurable feelings of the mind or imagination. These include pleasures that come by way of sensory experiences of art and nature, but also include those "only seized by the eyes of understanding, that is, those found in in universal truths, those that follow from general laws." More telling still, Diderot writes, "A third order of pleasures and pains are those affecting the heart which give rise in us to so many very different inclinations or *passions*. Their source is in the notion of *our perfection* or *our imperfection*, of our virtues and vices."

This last remark must be highlighted. For here we cross over from merely a recuperated role for the passions in morality (which could remain instrumental) to a bona fide conception of the passionate agent. Indeed, the last quote suggests that *moral* agency is at least partly *constituted* by passion. The moral agent has a certain sensibility—a sensible

<sup>42</sup> See Diderot, *Oeuvres complètes* (Paris: Garnier, 1875; reprinted Nendeln, Lichtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1966) 1:75 n. 1.

sentiment of joy in her perfection (i.e. in the fitting use of her capacities), and a sensible sentiment of pain in her imperfection. To this Diderot adds a complementary sensibility to the passions of others, namely, their pain and pleasure, sorrow and happiness, which he calls the "sensitivity to humankind."

To be clear, much more would need to be said to flesh out these barebones claims into a plausible, comprehensive account of human agency. And whether Diderot does this to our satisfaction, I shall not pretend to say. For my purposes, it suffices that he clearly does think moral agency is constituted (at least partly) by our passionate or affective capacities. And the reason this is enough is that our main question has always been only this: can Diderot's view of agency (complete or not) be linked to a view of human dignity?

## "I Am a Man": Diderot's Account of Human Dignity

To see the way Diderot builds the link to dignity, it helps first to make clear how the link *cannot* be derived: it cannot come from Diderot's suggestion that we have an original "sensitivity to humankind." To speak of such sensitivity brings to mind the widespread eighteenthcentury discussions of "sympathy"—that capacity to feel what others feel, especially their misery, and what today we usually call "empathy."43 But to say that humans are naturally sympathetic is a descriptive claim that, at best, might be marshaled to defend a natural human tendency to *care* for other humans. Thus, our natural sensitivity to the plight of other humans plausibly elicits or enhances our prosocial motives toward them. But it doesn't entail that we respect them, which is what we've said is required to substantiate a theory of dignity. Specifically, we need a concept akin to recognition-respect for an

<sup>43</sup> The concept was elaborated at length by Hume, Smith, and de Grouchy, to name a few who treated it explicitly. But also important was Rousseau's concept of a variant on sympathy, *pitié*. The best first address for the history of this concept in both ancient and modern thought is Eric Schliesser, ed., *Sympathy: A History* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015).

unearned, normatively privileged status. So, does Diderot make this kind of connection?

Yes. But what is especially exciting is how he makes this connection: Diderot inserts his substantive notion of passionate agency into a Pufendorfian model of natural law. This is not obvious, largely because Diderot only rarely discusses Pufendorf explicitly.44 However, what is important is ultimately not where Diderot does mention Pufendorf, but where he does not. Thus, in his 1765 *Encyclopédie* entry "Hobbisme," we find this important passage:

If you follow Hobbes, you are convinced that laws and the formation of society have made men better, while if you follow Monsieur Rousseau, you believe instead that they have depraved him…. Different times, different circumstances, different philosophies. Both men were extreme. Between their two systems there is another which may convey the truth: in effect that, although the human condition is one of perpetual strife, man's goodness and wickedness remain constant, his happiness and suffering circumscribed by limits he cannot breach.45

The middle ground here, which Diderot says, "may convey the truth," must be Pufendorf. To see why, we must only ask, what establishes the limits we "cannot breach"? A survey of Diderot's practical philosophy makes the answer to this easy and certain: these limits are set by the "the general will"—that is, the will of the community. I don't have the space to explain carefully this crucial concept of Diderot's practical thought, but for our purposes, we need to grasp only this one crucial aspect: according to Diderot, the "general will" is manifested through participation in a community where there is reciprocal recognition of

<sup>44</sup> See the entry "Citoyen," in *Political Writings*, trans. and ed. by John Hope Mason and Robert Wokler (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 14–17.

<sup>45</sup> Diderot, "Hobbisme," in *Political Writings*, 27–28.

status between members of that community—*just as Pufendorf would have had it*.

That this must be Diderot's position is made clear in another entry, his "Droit Naturel" (Natural Right) of 1755. Diderot there confronts the pesky political question of social defection, by taking to task, in a kind of dialogue, an imagined challenger to the general will. As Diderot construes this challenger, he bucks the entire superstructure of the social contract in virtue of expressing his willingness to forgo his own fundamental right against harm—which the social contract provides him—just so that he may harm others. "I realize I bring terror and confusion to the human race," this man thus calls out, "but I must either be miserable or create misery for others, and no one is more dear to me than myself."46 Diderot then memorably remarks:

What then shall we reply to this violent interlocutor before smothering him? That everything he says may be reduced to the question of whether he acquires a right over the lives of others in forfeiting control over his own life to them; for he does not wish merely to be happy; he wishes also to be just and by his justice to ward off the ascription of "evil"; for otherwise we should have to shut him up without any reply.47

Diderot must be understood as arguing against Hobbes's claim that we are all the justifiable arbitrators of our rights. In particular, Hobbes is wrong to think that the starting point of deliberation is a place where all equally have a right to everything. Hobbes's mistake is to think that such a right follows from merely granting to everyone the right to preservation together with the right to judge the necessary means to that preservation. Diderot argues that we don't get a "right" out of this at all. For if we are genuinely cognizing

<sup>46</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," in *Political Writings*, 18.

<sup>47</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 19.

*rights*, then it must be the case that we already think, not merely that we want to be happy, but that we want to be *justly* happy. That is, if we are really in the conceptual "space" of rights-talk, then we can assume we want to choose the means to our happiness in a way that others will recognize the authority of our choices, which is to say, not resent those choices as evil or unjust.

Now, one might ask Diderot why he thinks that we want to be justly happy in the first place—that we want to be in the space of rights-talk? However, Diderot's reply in this memorable passage seems to be that such a question is insensible. Or rather, if it is sensible, then one reveals herself as truly unfit for society and thus justly suppressed by everyone else, her dissenting voice smothered, at least in effect. The upshot is a second bedrock assumption, this time of the equality of authority between all members of the community. One must either accept moral nakedness (and claim a "right" without grounding or justification), or one must assume an equal "authority" with all other persons. And this "choice"—really a normative injunction, given that one is already in community—holds for all members of the community. This is confirmed moments later when Diderot summarizes:

For an individual to know how far he ought to be a man, a citizen, a subject, a father, or a child, and when it befits him to live or die, he must address himself to the general will. It is for the general will to determine the limits of all duties. You have the most sacred *natural right* to everything that is not resisted by the whole human race…. Say to yourself often, "I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable *natural rights* except those of humanity."48

At this point, the Pufendorfian argument in Diderot is manifest. According to Diderot, as for Pufendorf, the duty to respect other

<sup>48</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 20.

persons is based on the idea of assumed and thus unearned status, which assumption is justified by facts of sociability. In other words, Diderot follows Pufendorf in arguing that a person's moral status is manifested *through* participation in a community of reciprocal recognition of that status. Or, as Diderot put the point at the end of "Droit Naturel," albeit rather more cryptically, "Equity relates to justice as cause to its effect."49 What Diderot means is that justice only exists where equity of *status* is respected, that is, assumed. And of course, to say all this is already to say that the status in question is normatively privileged. After all, this status is what grounds the duty to respect others, and simultaneously draws the limits of my own rights. Thus it seems Diderot has a working concept of human dignity.

Two final questions must be answered. The first is just clarification: Why think Diderot's argument necessarily turns on a question of status? Couldn't the whole of it be construed simply as an argument for equity of right? No. To read Diderot this way would miss the spirit of "Droit Naturel" precisely because the entry purports to *explain* natural rights. Natural rights are ultimately what we can claim with authority, which authority is in turn defined as whatever we can claim that the general will will tolerate. And this tolerance is itself explained via a reference to status—albeit, in the sense of *shared and equal* status. Consider: According to Diderot, what is tolerated is what we can demand from others while still being allowed to remain "within them"—within the community, within humanity. And as we have seen, we can expect to be allowed so long as we *assume* our equal status, and thus that others have moral powers like ourselves. Taken altogether, we can claim with a "natural" authority only those rights that respect our status as one man—one human—among many. Hence, as I said, natural rights are explained by reference to status.50

<sup>49</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 21.

<sup>50</sup> Indeed, elsewhere Diderot makes explicit (and now unlike Pufendorf ) that there are no exceptions to this ultimate appeal to the general will—not morally anyway. Thus, in his entry "Citoyen," Diderot argues that even if the sovereign is relieved of a political duty to respect equal dignity, she is still subject to the moral demands of dignity: "In its public face, [the moral being of the sovereign] must never confront resistance." However, "In its private capacity [the moral being of the sovereign] may suffer such resistance on the part of individuals and may even succumb to it. Because this moral being has estates and responsibilities, and tenancies and tenants, etc. we must so to speak, distinguish the sovereign from the subject of sovereignty within it" (Diderot, "Citoyen," 16).

The second, more pressing, question is this: where is the tie back to the passionate person? That is, granting the first part of my reading that there is a Pufendorfian argument in Diderot's work for dignity qua unearned, normatively privileged status—one can still ask, does Diderot think that respecting a person's status is constitutively tied to acknowledging her not just as a rational agent, but also a passionate one?

It would be strange and bad for Diderot if it turned out that he did *not* think there was such a tie. For then his account of dignity would be radically disjoined from the conception of the passionate person we previously identified in his philosophy. Thankfully, it is clear enough that Diderot does draw a connection to the passionate person. To see this, we can simply follow Diderot's own lead; first, in "Droit Naturel":

But, you will ask, in what does this general will reside? Where can I consult it? … In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations; in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions—indignation and resentment which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retribution.51

Why is the general will expressed in the principles of all civil societies? Because there are regularities in what all humans *desire*, and thus what they would take *joy* in and so demand you not to interfere with; because there are regularities in what they would shun as "evil," as well as what they would call "good," which, as we saw for Diderot, are

<sup>51</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 20 (original ellipsis).

denominations based on *sentiments* of desire and aversion, pleasure and pain. Or again, why is the general will expressed even in savage societies? Because absent positive law, there remain regularities in human nature—in or out of civil society—about the causes of *pleasure* and *pain, joy* and *misery, love* and *hate*. And so, assuming the general will is definitional of human agency for Diderot, this single passage implicates passionate principles of human nature in that notion of agency.

This connection between agency and passion is confirmed by Diderot's reflections on human nature in his *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville*—a fiery, anti-Colonial dialogue devoted in part to a defense of "savage" nature.52 Therein we find Diderot upending the familiar religious dogma that civil law and the law of nature should be patterned on religious laws, which are "engraved in our hearts." Specifically, Diderot rejects the claim that religious laws inform us of "men's eternal relations with another." Instead, he asserts a new view of what is engraved in the heart: "We have no more in common with other human beings at birth than an organic similarity of form, the same need, an attraction to the same pleasures, and a shared aversion to the same pains. These are the things which make man what he is, and which should form the basis of the morality suited to him."53 Here Diderot brings his materialist inflected view about passionate agency together with his view of natural law in just the way we would expect him to, if human dignity is constituted, substantively, by the passionate person.

This connection is further buttressed by Diderot's direct attacks on colonial racism in the *Supplément*, which seem to rely, at least partly, on this substantive notion of human dignity. Thus, speaking through the

<sup>52</sup> Diderot, *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville*, in *Political Writings*, trans. and ed. John Hope Mason and Robert Wokler (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 31–75. The dialogue was inspired by Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who was a contemporary of Diderot and famous for being the first Frenchman to circumnavigate the earth. Bougainville published an account of his expeditions to various foreign lands, including Tahiti, in *Voyage autour du monde* (1771).

<sup>53</sup> Diderot, *Supplément*, 67.

voice of a Tahitian native who is addressing his imperious European invaders, Diderot writes:

This inhabitant of Tahiti, who you wish to ensnare like an animal, is your brother. You are both children of Nature. What right do you have over him that he does not have over you? You came; did we attack you? Have we plundered your ship? Did we seize you and expose you to the arrows of our enemies? Did we harness you to work with our animals in the fields? We respected our image in you.54

Surely this "Native" outcry isn't meant to be merely the expression of a rational claim by the Tahitians, for example, to have their "rights" respected. To say otherwise would be a baffling interpretation of Diderot's intent given the gravitas that imbues this passage, and indeed the whole stretch of text in which it appears, which stands as one of the more moving attacks on colonialism in the eighteenth century. Instead, this native outcry is manifestly meant to give voice to the anger, indignation, misery, sadness, and in a word, the passions of the Tahitians. In other words, it is the passions themselves—the way the Tahitians *feel* about their oppression—that Diderot is, at least partly, holding up as demanding respect. Indeed, running parallel to this point is the fact that Diderot explicitly blames his fellow Europeans for their lack of recognition *of* those passions: "With your unfeeling heart," the Tahitian further cries, "you can have no sense of pity and do not deserve any."55 And once we connect these Tahitian outcries to Diderot's account of the general will, what we end up with is a judgment on the European failure to recognize the will of native peoples, which "will" must be understood as expressed partly *in* their anger, indignation, misery, and sadness. That is, Diderot is accusing his fellow Europeans of failing to

<sup>54</sup> Diderot, *Supplément*, 42–43.

<sup>55</sup> Diderot, *Supplément*, 45.

respect the Tahitians not only as rational agents—agents who might well make rights claims—but also as *passionate* agents.

All this comes to a head when one of the Tahitians expresses his confusion over western Christian notions of God: "Don't you see that in your country you have confused something which cannot feel or think or desire or will; which one takes or leaves, keeps or sells, without it suffering or complaining, with a very different thing that cannot be exchanged or acquired; which *does* have freedom, will, desire; which has the ability to give itself up or hold itself back forever; which complains or suffers; and which *can never be an article of exchange* unless its character is forgotten and violence is done to its nature."56 Kant is famous for lauding human dignity as "beyond all price." But it would seem that Diderot made the point before him, albeit with this crucial difference: Diderot made the point part and parcel of a claim about passionate persons.

If there is any remaining doubt that Diderot's concept of dignity is based specifically on passionate agency, such doubt should be extinguished when we recall Diderot's allowance in "Droit Naturel," quoted earlier, for an appreciable general will even in nonhuman animals. For that allowance was made in virtue of the fact that nature has extended to nonhuman animals "those two emotions—indignation and resentment," "to compensate for social laws and public retribution."57 If this is true, then the notion of "status" we've been investigating in Diderot cannot depend entirely on the rational capacity to make claims. Diderot confirms this, ironically by explaining why animals do not have *equal* status:

If the status of animals were roughly equal to our own; if there were reliable means of communication between them and us; if they could transmit their feelings and thoughts to us clearly and come

to apprehend our own with equal certainty … we should have to summon them to it; and the case for *natural right* would no longer be pleaded before the bar of *mankind* but before that of all *animal kind*. But animals are separated from us by fixed and eternal barriers; and we are dealing here with a system of knowledge and ideas peculiar to the human species, arising from and forming its station in the world.58

I think this passage puts my interpretation of Diderot beyond doubt. But before stating why, let me grant outright that one might fairly contest whether Diderot is right about such "fixed and eternal" barriers. Thus, one might wonder, if animals get some claim on the normative space of general will in virtue of being feeling creatures of a certain kind, and, moreover, if we are sensitive to such feelings, then isn't it prima facie suspect to say these barriers are "fixed?" Worse still, one might reasonably worry that by conditioning *being* passionate on *expressing* passion in a certain way, as this passage does, Diderot is inviting classic "line drawing" problems that risk leaving out some humans, and, in particular, disabled persons or the very young. However, my task was merely to make the case that Diderot is a genuine protagonist in the second story of human dignity. And in this respect, I think this passage is conclusive. For, by making this comparison with nonhuman animals, Diderot reaffirms (1) that agency is constituted partly by feeling; (2) that this aspect of agency bears fundamentally on the question of moral status; and (3) that humans enjoy a *peculiar* status in this respect, namely, one with normative privilege. One can only marvel, then, at the fact that in this same passage, in the last line, Diderot joins Pufendorf in deploying the term "dignity" in its moralized sense—a fact that is obscured only by translation. Thus the last line in its original French reads, "qui émanent de sa dignité

<sup>58</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 20.

et la constituent."59 Ironically, then, to translate this as "station in the world" (as the modern Cambridge edition does) might actually have been fitting for Diderot's own English readers. For that translation at least has the virtue of breaking from dignity's older, merit connotation of "elevated rank." Nevertheless, in the light of all I've said here, this translation seems crucially inapt for us today. From our contemporary perspective, Diderot really did mean *dignity*.

# Chapter 8: Dignity - Kant's Revolutionary Conception
*Oliver Sensen*

Kant seems to introduce a new conception of dignity into philosophy. He argues that all human beings ought to be respected, and in turn that human beings have an equal moral standing—independently of race, gender, nationality, birth, wealth, or orientation. It is commonly thought that Kant justifies this view by reference to an absolute inner value all human beings possess equally. On this interpretation, (1) it is an objective fact that all human beings are precious, (2) "dignity" is the name for this value, and (3) dignity is the reason why one can claim one's rights against others. This picture is a prominent one in contemporary rights debates, and given the apparent influence of Kant on this debate, one can speak of the hegemony of Kant in contemporary debates.1

<sup>1</sup> Cf. Remy Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," *Philosophical Perspectives* 23 (2009): 49.

In this chapter I shall argue that Kant's fame in this matter is not fully deserved. He does hold that all human beings should be respected even a criminal deserves respect as a human being (cf. *Metaphysics of Morals* [MS], 6:463).2 However, I argue that he does not ground this requirement on a value the other possesses, and "dignity" is not the name for such a value. Nor is he the inventor of the requirement of universal respect. Indeed, on this last score Kant himself famously credits Rousseau for awakening him to that idea: "I am an inquirer by inclination…. There was a time when I believed this constituted the honor of humanity, and I despised the people, who know nothing. Rousseau set me right about this…. I learned to honor humanity" (*Remarks*, 20:44). There *is* something revolutionary in Kant's thought. However, it does not lie in his account of dignity, but in the way Kant justifies the requirement to respect all others. Kant is the inventor of moral autonomy3 in that he argues that all moral requirements must originate in one's own reason.

In order to substantiate my interpretation, I shall first look at the general meaning of Kant's conception of dignity (first section), and defend that interpretation against important objections (second section). I shall then distinguish four main ways in which Kant uses his notion of dignity (third section). After that I shall analyze his justification for the claim that all human beings should be respected (fourth section), before summing up the differences between Kant and the contemporary conception of dignity (fifth section).

## The General Meaning of Kantian Dignity

What does it mean to say that human beings have dignity? In the contemporary usage often attributed to Kant, "dignity" is the name for

<sup>2</sup> Page numbers refer to the Prussian Academy edition of Kant's works (de Gruyter, 1902–), citing volume:page. All translations are taken from the Cambridge edition, general editors Paul Guyer and Allen Wood.

<sup>3</sup> Cf. J. B. Schneewind, *The Invention of Autonomy* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 3.

a value inherent in all human beings that grounds the requirement to respect them. This conception has three main features: (1) It is an objective fact that human beings have this value; (2) because of this feature one has the standing to claim respect from others, for example, to demand an apology or reparation; (3) respect also involves that the other treats one in a special second-personal way, for example: because of one's dignity one cannot only demand an apology for an insult, but also that the other look one in the eye.4

It is easy to see why this conception of dignity is commonly attributed to Kant. In the *Groundwork* Kant famously makes the distinction between dignity and price: "What has a price can be replaced by something else as its *equivalent*; what on the other hand is raised above all price and therefore admits of no equivalent has a dignity" (*Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* [GMS], 4:434) Kant goes on to apparently give a definition of dignity when he distinguishes "relative worth, that is, a price," from "an inner worth, that is, *dignity*" (GMS 4:435). In other words, Kant seems to define dignity as an inner worth. Moreover, he seems to ground the requirement to respect others on this worth in the following passage from the *Metaphysics of Morals*: "The *respect* that I have for others or that another can require from me (*observantia aliis praestanda*) is therefore recognition of a *dignity* (*dignitas*) in other human beings, that is, of a worth that has no price" (MS 6:462). It would thus seem that, of the three features mentioned above, (1) the objective preciousness, (2) the standing to claim rights, and (3) the standing to claim them in a special way, Kant does introduce at least the first two.5 Hence why, if one reads these passages in isolation, it seems clear that Kant proposes the contemporary paradigm of dignity: Because one has an inner worth (a dignity), one can claim respect from another.

<sup>4</sup> Cf. Stephen Darwall, *The Second-Person Standpoint* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006), 119.

<sup>5</sup> For the third see the final section below.

However, if one reads these passages in their contexts, and includes the other tenets of Kant's philosophy, the impression changes. Thus, notice that immediately following the passage that connects dignity and respect, Kant says the following: "Humanity itself is a dignity; for a human being cannot be used merely as a means … but must always be used at the same time as an end. It is just in this that his dignity (personality) consists, by which he raises himself … over all *things*" (MS 6:462). Here Kant turns the relationship between dignity and respect around: It is not that one should respect others because they have dignity, but others have dignity because they should be respected! How can we make sense of this?

These passages are coherent if Kant is still using the older conception of dignity as rank or elevated standing, which was prominent in the Stoics, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the natural law tradition.6 Indeed, in both works Kant uses "dignity" in the context of something "being raised above" something else (GMS 4:434), and he directly specifies it as "rank" (*Anthropology*, 7:127; MS 6:468), "prerogative" (GMS 4:438), or "sublimity" (*Erhabenheit*) (GMS 4:440). Unlike in the contemporary paradigm, in the older traditional one "dignity" was not the name for an intrinsic value property, that is, a preciousness an object would have even if it existed in isolation. Instead, by itself "dignity" merely expresses a relation of one thing being raised over another. Correspondingly, why one thing is higher and in which respect it is raised needs to be specified by the context in which "dignity" is used. This might be a moral context, and it might be in terms of value, but it does not have to be. Dignity can be predicated of very different things. Kant, for instance, speaks about the dignity of a teacher (*Religion*, 6:162), or the dignity of mathematics (*Critique of Pure Reason* [KrV] B492). Dignity is not a moral value in these

<sup>6</sup> Cf. the contributions in this volume, and my *Kant on Human Dignity* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2011), 152–64. My claim is that the first passage in 6:462 states *what* should be respected in others, and that the second states *why* one should respect them.

contexts—otherwise one might have a duty to become a teacher or study mathematics—but instead expresses that a teacher has a special position in the classroom because of his authority to dismiss class, and that mathematics is special among the sciences in virtue of being more purely a priori.

Similarly, by itself an elevation does not give rise to rights or duties. It is merely a relation in which one thing *x* is raised above another *y* in a specific respect. However, there can be contexts in which an elevated position comes with privileges akin to rights. A king who had the most powerful position in society could demand certain prerogatives and special treatment. In addition, an elevated position might also exact an admiration that has similarity with a feeling of respect. This feeling of respect (*reverentia* or appraisal respect) is different from the respect one owes to others (*observantia* or recognition respect).7 For instance, the king's palace, his dress and retinue might have instilled a feeling of awe in an observer. However, it is not in virtue of being "higher" as such that these privileges and admiration occur, just as it does not follow from one person being taller than another that he deserves special treatment. Rather, it is the underlying feature (e.g., the political power) that gives rise to the elevation that explains any special treatment.

## Two Objections and Two Replies

One might resist the suggestion that Kant is relying on an older, traditional paradigm of dignity. For instance, it might be pointed out that Kant uses the German *Würde*, and *not* the older Latin *dignitas*. 8 However, this difference is more apparent than real. First, Kant knew the traditional paradigm of dignity, and he directly refers to what he takes to be the Stoic conception (cf. *Religion*, 6:57n). Second, Kant's predecessors wrote in Latin, and so his concepts often are more a

<sup>7</sup> Cf. Stephen Darwall, "Two Kinds of Respect," *Ethics* 88 (1979): 38f.

<sup>8</sup> Cf. Jeremy Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012), 24.

translation of the Latin than an unrelated German usage. Accordingly, Kant often specifies the German term with the Latin term he has in mind: "*respect* … is … recognition of a *dignity* (*dignitas*)" (MS 6:463). Finally, the roots of the Latin *dignitas* and the German *Würde* are very similar. The Latin *dignitas* is believed to derive from *dignum* (worthy),9 while the German *Würde* comes from *würdig* (worthy).

A second line of resistance is more serious. Thus it might be asked, even if Kant does use to the older conception of dignity, does he not also put forth the contemporary one? After all, he does seem to define "dignity" as inner worth. In response, I shall give three reasons why Kant does not put forward the contemporary paradigm of dignity. In contemporary usage, I have argued, "dignity" is the name for a value property that grounds the requirement to respect others. However, (1) Kant does not have a conception of value that all human beings possess as such. (2) On his account, value follows from the moral law, and does not ground it; and (3) dignity is similar to value, but not itself value. Think about it: Kant says that (i) only a good will can have absolute value (cf. GMS 4:393), (ii) not all human beings have a good will (cf. MS 6:463), and that (iii) all human beings should be respected (MS 6:463). This indicates that value is not the reason why one should respect others; and in turn that Kant does not adhere to the contemporary paradigm.

But let us examine points (1)–(3) in detail.

- (1) The first reason why Kant does not conceive of "dignity" as a name for an inherent value property all human beings possess is that he does not have such a conception of value. Kant famously opens his *Groundwork* discussion by stating: "It is impossible to think of anything at all in the world, or indeed even beyond it, that could be considered good without limitation except a good will" (GMS 4:393). Kant repeats
<sup>9</sup> Cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 153–55; similarly Michael Rosen, *Dignity: Its History and Meaning* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012), 19f.

this view throughout his writings: "Only through that which he does without regard to enjoyment, in full freedom and independently of that which nature could passively provide for him, does he give his being as the existence of a person an absolute value" (*Critique of the Power of Judgment* [KU], 5:208f; cf. 443). Absolute value is not an inherent property all human beings possess, but *results from* a good will.

A good will, however, is nothing other than a will following the Categorical Imperative for its own sake. Kant says: "*That will is absolutely good* … whose maxim, if made a universal law, can never conflict with itself " (GMS 4:437). Predicating that a will is good does not postulate the existence of an inherent value property; rather, a "good will … consists just in the principle of action being free from all influences of contingent grounds" (GMS 4:426), that is, in a will following the moral law or Categorical Imperative for its own sake. The Categorical Imperative runs: "*act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law*" (GMS 4:421), and its content is just the freedom from contingent grounds (cf. GMS 4:400–402, 431–32). Kant therefore ascribes value not to the mere existence of human beings, but to the quality of actions and thereby one's will:

Thus good or evil is, strictly speaking, referred to actions … , and if anything is to be good or evil absolutely (and in every respect and without any further condition), … it would be only the way of acting, the maxim of the will, and consequently the acting person himself … , but not a thing. (*Critique of Practical Reason* [KpV], 5:60)

So this is one respect in which Kant differs from the contemporary view of dignity.

- (2) If value is not an inherent property of a thing (or human being) but can only be predicated of actions and wills, what is
the meaning of "good" or "value," on Kant's account? Kant is a prescriptivist about value: The information the expressions "is good" or "has value" add to a proposition is that reason prescribes it as practically necessary: "The will is a capacity to choose *only that* which reason … cognizes as practically necessary, that is, as good" (GMS 4:412).

This prescription of reason can be of two kinds. If reason cognizes something to be necessary as a means, for example, to take the plane if one wants to get to Australia quickly, it dictates a hypothetical imperative. If, however, it prescribes something as necessary under all circumstances, it prescribes a categorical imperative:

Since every practical law represents a possible action as good … , all imperatives are formulae for the determination of action that is … good in some way. Now, if the action would be good merely as a means *to something else* the imperative is *hypothetical*; if the action is represented as *in itself* good, hence as necessary in a will in itself conforming to reason, as its principle, *then it is categorical*. (GMS 4:414)

The concept of "absolute value" is therefore not an inherent property all human beings possess as such. Rather it is whatever a categorical imperative or moral law commands: "*The concept of good and evil must not be determined before the moral law* … *but only* … *after it and by means of it*" (KpV 5:62f.). Thus, to say that something is "absolutely" or "inherently" good, on Kant's account, is another way of saying that reason prescribes something as necessary "in every respect and without any further condition" (KpV 5:60).10 Since absolute value is something that follows from the Categorical Imperative, it is not something that

<sup>10</sup> Kant therefore uses "absolute," "inner," and "unconditional" interchangeably, cf.: "The word absolute is now more often used merely to indicate that something is valid of a thing considered in itself and thus internally [*innerlich*]" (KrV B381).

could be the foundation of moral laws, such as the requirement to respect others.11

- (3) Even if Kant does not *ground* moral requirements on a value, could not "dignity" still be the *name* for one? After all, he does seem to define "dignity" as a value in the famous passages from the *Groundwork* and *Metaphysics of Morals*. However, if one keeps Kant's usage of "worth" or "value" in mind,12 dignity is not strictly speaking a value, even if they have certain elements in common. Let me explain: To say that something has value, I have argued, is another way of saying what reason prescribes. If reason says that a knife is useful for cutting bread, then the knife has a relative value. "Relative value" here means nothing more than "is useful for." Similarly, if reason commands something unconditionally, for example, never to deceive, then the act of not deceiving has an absolute value. But "having absolute value" means nothing more than "reason prescribes it unconditionally." Such an unconditional command, which strikes down self-conceit, exacts a feeling of respect (*reverentia*): "Before a humble common man in whom I perceive uprightness of character …*my spirit bows*, whether I want it or whether I do not…. His example holds before me a law that strikes down my self-conceit" (KpV 5:76f ).
By contrast, strictly speaking "dignity" expresses only that something is raised above something else. Now, whatever is so raised might also exact a feeling of respect in virtue of being elevated. Thus, in the famous *Groundwork* passage where Kant seems to define "dignity" as "absolute value" (GMS 4:434–36), he asks why a morally good person abides by

<sup>11</sup> For the fuller argument, see my *Kant on Dignity*, 23–27, and the "Justification" section below.

<sup>12</sup> In German there is only one term, *Wert*, and so I shall use "worth" and "value" interchangeably.

the moral law (cf. GMS 4:434). His answer is because morality has an absolute or higher value, and it is this higher value that exacts respect. However, "dignity" here expresses only that moral value is higher than other value, not that dignity is itself a value. In other words, all absolute value has a dignity, but not every dignity has an absolute value (in that it should be pursued—as the example of the dignity of mathematics brings out). Indeed, in the few passages where "dignity" appears next to "value," Kant talks specifically about this *elevated* worth of morality:

From the (natural) human being's feeling himself compelled to revere the (moral) human being within his own person … comes *exaltation* of the highest self-esteem, the feeling of his inner worth … in terms of which he … possesses an inalienable dignity (*dignitas interna*), which instills in him respect for himself (*reverentia*). (MS 6:436)

## The Varieties of Dignity

If "dignity" is not the name for an inherent preciousness, but expresses an elevated standing of something over something else, in virtue of what do human beings have dignity? On this account dignity is in need of a scale to specify in which respect something is raised above something else. What is the scale in the case of human dignity? Furthermore, is this dignity absolute, and the same for all human beings? Is it only to be found in human beings, or do other creatures have it as well? In Kant's case, there is not one single answer to these questions. He uses "dignity" in very different contexts, and has at least four different usages.

- (i) In a first way, Kant uses "dignity" to denote an elevation of one member of a group above the other members. This view is not necessarily tied to human beings, as Kant talks about

the dignity of mathematics (cf. KrV B492) or philosophy (cf. KrV B86). Nor is dignity in this sense absolute. The dignity of a teacher (cf. *Religion*, 6:162), for instance, can be gained, lost, and regained. Notably, this is also the sense in which Kant talks about the dignity of a regent or minister (*Perpetual Peace*, 8:344), or calls the powers in a state "civic dignities," which comprise the "relation of a *commander* (*imperans*) to *those who obey*" (MS 6:315). This usage is thus akin to the general use of *dignitas* in ancient Rome (cf. Griffin's chapter in this volume). Out of the 111 times that the term *Würde* appears in Kant's texts, 39 refer to this sense of dignity.13

- (ii) Kant uses "dignity" in a different sense when he talks about *human* dignity (*Würde der Menschheit* or *Menschenwürde*). In this context Kant talks about the elevation of *all* human beings above the rest of nature. Human beings are elevated, according to Kant, because they possess the capacity of freedom. In virtue of freedom human beings are not a mere plaything in nature, that is, they are not just a means to the end of another (*Naturrecht Feyerabend*, 27:1320, GMS 4:435). This usage is similar to the Stoic conception of dignity (cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 164–72). Dignity here is absolute, and peculiar to rational beings that have free will. Kant calls this dignity "innate" (MS 6:420) and "inalienable" (MS 6:436). It is not necessarily just tied to human beings. If there is another species that has free will, it would be elevated over the rest of nature in the same way. Altogether, Kant uses "dignity" 40 times out of 111 in this sense (cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 178f ).
<sup>13</sup> For the full list of the passages and their analysis see my *Kant on Dignity*, 177f.

Although this kind of dignity is often used in moral contexts, dignity by itself does not yield any moral implications. Accordingly, saying that human beings have dignity in virtue of freedom merely says that human beings are special in nature. But other animals are special in different respects. A cheetah can run faster than other animals, and a centipede has more feet. A further argument is required in order to derive any rights or duties from this special quality. In the history of philosophy, some of the normative premises for such duties were to live in accordance with nature or to imitate God (cf. Kent's contribution to this volume). In Kant's case, I shall argue, the normative premise is the Categorical Imperative.

- (iii) Closely connected with Kant's second usage of "dignity" is a third type, what I shall call the "dignity of morality." Human beings can realize their "initial dignity" (*Conflict of Faculties*, 7:73) if they make a proper use of their freedom. This too is a Stoic element (cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 168f ). Human dignity comes in two stages: "The dignity of human nature lies only in its freedom…. But the dignity of one human being (worthiness) rests on the use of his freedom" (*Reflection*, 6856, 19:181). The worthiness one can acquire in making a proper use of one's freedom consists in a morally good will; and this third type concerns the dignity of morality. In this sense, Kant speaks about the "dignity of virtue" (MS 6:483), or the "sublimity and *dignity* in the person who fulfils all his duties" (GMS 4:440). Kant uses "dignity" in this way thirty times throughout his published works (cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 179f ).
This third type of dignity is not absolute, and not necessarily universal. Not everyone has a good will: "I cannot deny all respect to even a vicious man as a human being … even though by his deeds he makes himself unworthy of it" (MS 6:463). A good will can be gained, lost

and regained. It is something one should strive for, and it exacts a feeling of respect from oneself and others (cf. again KpV 5:76f ). But while this feeling of respect might be a motive to be moral, it is not the justification for why one should have a good will. Having a feeling cannot be commanded (cf. MS 6:449). Instead, the justification for why one should have a good will is the Categorical Imperative. A good will consists in following the Categorical Imperative for its own sake (cf. again GMS 4:426), and this is what makes imperative the striving to acquire a good will. The seven occurrences where "dignity" appears next to "value" in Kant's works occur in the context of the dignity of morality—which is not surprising, as it is morality that has the highest value (cf. my *Kant on Dignity*, 180).

- (iv) Finally, there is the peculiar usage of "dignity" in which Kant says that human beings have dignity because they should be respected. This is a way in which all human beings are elevated over the rest of nature, but it is different from the second way Kant uses "dignity" specified above. Here Kant is not saying that human beings are special in virtue of a capacity they have, but because they are the beneficiaries of respect. In fact, there are two different ways in which human beings are said to have dignity because they should be respected—corresponding to the two forms of respect: *observantia* and *reverentia* (see the first section). The first passage I have already cited at the beginning of the first section: "Humanity itself is a dignity; for a human being cannot be used merely as a means … but must always be used at the same time as an end. It is just in this that his dignity (personality) consists, by which he raises himself … over all *things*" (MS 6:462). Here Kant talks about the respect one owes to others or recognition respect (*observantia*). One should respect others in this sense, I have argued in the second section, because it is commanded by a
categorical imperative of one's own reason. But the resulting dignity (iv1) is absolute, and pertains to all human beings.14

The second passage in which Kant says that human beings have dignity seems to work slightly differently. It appears in a section on a duty against servility or false humility. Kant's point is that no one has to lower him- or herself because everyone is capable of a good will that is of absolute value. In virtue of a good will everyone could exact an esteem from every other rational being. The respect Kant has in mind here is a feeling of appraisal respect (*reverentia*). The passage runs:

But a human being regarded as a *person*, that is, as the subject of a morally practical reason, is exalted above any price; for as a person (*homo noumenon*) he is not to be valued merely as a means to the ends of others or even to his own ends, but … he possesses a *dignity* (an absolute inner worth) by which he exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world. He can measure himself with every other being of this kind and value himself on a footing of equality with them. (MS 6:434f )

Because one is capable of a good will, which is the most important value, one should not lower oneself toward others. The idea of a good will causes the human being to "revere the (moral) human being within" for the "inner worth … in terms of which he … possesses an inalienable dignity … which instills in him respect for himself (*reverentia*)" (MS 6:436). In this second sense (iv2), therefore, a human being is elevated over the rest of nature because he can exact esteem from others in virtue of a morally good will. Strictly speaking, though, this sense of dignity is not absolute. One can acquire a good will (which alone has absolute value), but also fail to have one.

<sup>14</sup> For Kant's views on the beginning of life see MS 6:280–82, for his views on old age MS 6:468f.

In sum: There are different ways in which a human being can have dignity, according to Kant. Some of these are absolute, while others are not. "Dignity" just signifies that a human being is elevated in some respect. This could refer to the elevation of one human being over other human beings. In this sense it could describe an elevation in terms of birth, wealth, power, or merit, or the elevation of a morally good being ([i], [iii], and [iv2]). But all these senses are not universal and not absolute. One can gain this standing and lose it. On the other hand, there are two senses in which the dignity of human beings is universal and absolute ([ii] and [iv1]). All human beings are special in nature in virtue of having free will. In addition, all human beings are elevated because they are owed recognition respect (*observantia*). It is the justification for this last form of dignity (iv1) that interests us here.

## Justification

How does Kant justify the idea that all human beings should be respected and therefore have an equal dignity? So far I have argued that dignity is not itself the reason, as it is not an inherent precious feature all human beings possess, but merely expresses that something is elevated over something else. However, it is not that human beings should be respected because they are elevated; rather in one sense (iv1) they are elevated because they should be respected. But why, then, should one respect others? Kant's answer—which I have already hinted at but will in this section explicate more fully—is that the requirement to respect others is a categorical imperative. One should always respect others, and the command does not admit of exceptions. In being necessary and universal, the requirement must lie a priori in one's own reason. This is because experience (for instance the experience of the value of another) could never yield necessity and universality. Only an a priori law could do that.

What is respect? On Kant's account, the respect that one ought to have for others is not a feeling of appraisal (*reverentia*), because—to

reiterate—a feeling cannot be commanded (cf. again MS 6:449). Rather it is a maxim or principle one should adopt of not exalting oneself above others, that is, of not thinking of oneself as something better:

Respect to be shown to others … is not to be understood as the mere *feeling* that comes from comparing our own *worth* with another's (such as … a pupil toward his teacher, or any subordinate toward his superior). It is rather to be understood as the *maxim* of … not exalting myself above others. (MS 6:449f )

Why should one adopt this maxim? Kant holds that it is required by the formula of humanity, which is itself one formula of the Categorical Imperative: "The duty of respect for my neighbor is contained in the maxim not to degrade any other to a mere means to my ends" (MS 6:450). This maxim not to treat others as mere means is one half of the formula of humanity. The other half commands one to positively help others. The formula of humanity runs: "*So act that you use humanity, in your own person as well as in the person of any other, always at the same time as an end, never merely as a means*" (GMS 4:429). Kant conceives of this formula to be "tantamount" to and "at bottom the same" as the main formulation of the Categorical Imperative (cf. GMS 4:436–38).15 The requirement to respect others is therefore a categorical imperative, and the justification for the formula of humanity will be the same as for any categorical principle.

This is, at least, how Kant specifies it. He says that the formula of humanity is a command of one's own reason: "This principle of humanity … is not borrowed from experience; … because of its universality … so that the principle must arise from pure reason" (GMS 4:431). The justification for this is the same as it is in his theoretical philosophy. Experience can provide examples of a few cases, but not of

<sup>15</sup> For a reconstruction of why those two are equivalent see my *Kant on Dignity*, 122–27.

all possible cases, and it can provide that something is the case, but not that it is *necessarily* so: "Necessity and strict universality are … secure indications of an *a priori* cognition" (KrV B4). In addition to this positive argument, Kant provides a negative one. He argues that all other theories than his own could only yield heteronomy and conditional necessity, not an unconditional ought: "If the will seeks the law that is to determine it *anywhere else* than in the fitness of its maxims for its own giving of universal law—consequently if, in going beyond itself, it seeks this law in a property of any of its objects—*heteronomy* always results" (GMS 4:441). But heteronomy cannot ground a moral obligation: "*Heteronomy* … not only does not ground any obligation at all but is instead opposed to the principle of obligation and to the morality of the will" (KpV 5:33).

What, more specifically, is heteronomy, and why is it unable to ground any moral requirements? Heteronomy, in short, is the idea that morality is based on a law that has a foreign source (e.g., it comes from society or nature), as it is not grounded in one's own reason. Heteronomy cannot yield morality, according to Kant, since one would need a motivation to comply with this foreign law. And this motivation could only arise from something we think we will get *out* of following the law—what Kant calls an "interest." That is, we will only be motivated to follow the foreign law if we think it will get us something we want, that is, produce a result that will satisfy some desire we have:

If one thought of him only as subject to a law (whatever it may be), this law had to carry with it some interest by way of attraction or constraint, since it did not as a law arise from *his* will; in order to conform with the law … one never arrived at duty but instead at the necessity of an action from a certain interest. (GMS 4:432f )

Kant's point is easier to see if one were to base morality in desires or an outside authority such as a government or an arbitrary God. If one were confronted with an outside command, one would need to have a further desire, say, not to be punished (this would be the "interest"), in order to be motivated to comply with that demand.

But does this also apply to the contemporary conception of dignity? Why would a value inherent in other people also yield heteronomy? Imagine that you should respect (*observantia*) another human being because that person has a value. If this value is supposed to be more than a description of what we actually do value, and more than something one should value for another reason,16 then value would be a property or substance that literally is in the other person. But how could one discover this property? (And why should one be motivated or bound to respect it?)

Kant's point is that one could only discover it through experience. On his account, all knowledge begins with the senses (cf. KrV B1). If one wanted to ground morality on a value the other possesses, one would first have to discover this value with one's senses. But if the value is not something one can discover with the five senses—one cannot literally see the value when performing surgery on a human being—the only sense left would be a feeling. However, feelings are relative and contingent, and cannot ground a necessary and universal law: "From the feeling of a sensation that may be different in every creature, no generally valid law can be derived for all thinking beings, and that is how the moral principle must be constituted" (*Kant's Lectures on Ethics Mrongovius II*, 29:625).17

But even if one were to claim—against Kant—that one can discover the value property with one's senses, or a nonnatural intuition (such as a seeing with a mental eye), this discovery would still be based on

<sup>16</sup> For such arguments cf. Christine Korsgaard, *Self-Constitution* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009) and Allen Wood, *Kantian Ethics* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008), 95–105.

<sup>17</sup> The same argument also rules out that Kant could conceive of dignity as the value of an "inner transcendental kernel" (Rosen, *Dignity*, 31); cf. KrV B798 and Thomas Hill, "In Defense of Human Dignity: Comments on Kant and Rosen," in *Understanding Human Dignity*, ed. Christopher McCrudden (New York: Oxford University Press, 2014), 315–27.

experience, and as experience is relative and contingent (cf. again KrV B3–4); it cannot ground a necessary moral law.

As a result, morality can only be necessary and universal if it is grounded in one's own reason. This origin of moral principles is what Kant describes as autonomy: The moral law is an a priori constitutive principle of pure reason (cf. KU 5:196f ). But what does that mean? Kant describes the origin of the moral law thus: "Pure reason … gives (to the human being) a universal law which we call the *moral law*" (KpV 5:31). Accordingly, the law is something "our own cognitive faculty … provides out of itself " (KrV B2), and is an "a priori proposition that is not based on any intuition, either pure or empirical" (KpV 5:31). It is also not a rational decision one makes consciously, like a New Year's resolution. Such a commitment would not be binding, for "the one imposing obligation … could always release the one put under obligation … so that … he would not be bound at all to a duty he lays upon himself " (MS 6:417). Rather, the moral law is prescribed prior to and independently of one's awareness. Independently of one's conscious deliberations, the moral law would still make itself heard in a way that is similar to a bad conscience. But this also does not mean that the moral law is innate, on Kant's account. For if it were innate, given by God or evolution, it would not be strictly necessary, since another law could have become innate this way (cf. KrV B167f ). Instead, the law is "initially acquired" (*On a discovery whereby any new critique of pure reason is to be made superfluous by an older one*, 8:222), meaning that when one is confronted with a moral situation, "reason … with complete spontaneity … declares actions to be necessary" (KrV B576).

But why should one believe that there really is such a law? So far Kant's argument has only been conditional: *if* one wants morality to be necessary and universal, it has to be grounded in autonomy. The condition, as he presents it, is provided by the ordinary view of morality (cf. GMS 4:389, 445). However, he is of course aware that this ordinary view might be false, and he does not rest his case on the popular view of morality. To this effect Kant gives a separate argument. If the moral law is a priori, then it should be demonstrable by its necessity and strict universality: "We can become aware of pure practical laws just as we are aware of pure theoretical principles, by attending to the necessity with which reason prescribes them to us" (KpV 5:30). In order to support that we can become aware of a necessary principle, Kant gives the following example of the "gallows." Imagine a prince commands you to give false testimony against an innocent and honorable man, who would then lose his life. And imagine that no desire speaks in favor of the moral action: If you refuse, you and your family will be punished, you will lose your influence at court, along with everything you hold dear, including your life, and so on. Similarly, suppose you do not believe in an afterlife, that you do not expect a revolution to follow upon your demise, that you are not a person who desires to be moral above all, and so on. Kant assumes that—even if no desire speaks in favor of refusing to give false testimony—everyone will judge the action to be morally wrong; the man is innocent after all.

But Kant does not introduce the gallows example to make the case that everyone has a direct knowledge of what is right and wrong, and that it does not need any further evidence. Rather he uses it to prove freedom, and grounds morality in freedom. His point is that the judgment about the wrongness of the action lets one discover that one *could* refuse to give false testimony. The agent "must admit without hesitation that it would be possible for him" (KpV 5:30). If this is the case, then one assumes that one could act independently of one's desires since one has assumed that *no* desire speaks in favor of the action—and this independence is freedom. The moral judgment therefore lets one discover that one assumes freedom: "He judges, therefore, that he can do something because he is aware that he ought to do it and cognizes freedom within" (KpV 5:30).

Kant then uses freedom to justify morality. Freedom is considered to be a causality, and the essential feature of causality is for Kant that it operates according to laws: "The concept of causality brings with it

that of laws" (GMS 4:446). The only law that could be a law of freedom (understood as independence from desires) is one that abstracts from all desires and ends adopted on account of desires. The only law that remains is the mere form of the law, which demands universality and is the same as the Categorical Imperative: "what, then, can freedom of the will be other than autonomy, that is … to act on no other maxim than that which can also have as object itself as universal law. This, however, is precisely the formula of the categorical imperative" (GMS 4:446f; cf. 402; KpV 5:29).

In concluding this section, I want to tie back the results to dignity. I have argued that dignity is not by itself the justification or grounding for moral requirements. Assuming I am right, how *does* dignity relate to the grounding of morality? The passage that explains the connection is also the passage in which Kant endorses the Stoic conception of dignity:

These philosophers [Stoics and others] derived their universal moral principle from the dignity of human nature, from its freedom (as an independence from the power of the inclinations), and they could not have laid down a better or nobler principle for foundation. They then drew the moral laws directly from reason, the sole legislator, commanding absolutely through its laws. And so was everything quite correctly apportioned. (*Religion*, 6:57n)

Morality is grounded in freedom. Inasmuch as one has freedom as a capacity, one is also under its law, the moral law: "The two concepts are so inseparably connected that one could even define practical freedom through independence of the will from anything other than the moral law alone" (KpV 5:93f ). For a purely rational being that does not have inclinations, the moral law would be a purely descriptive law that governs how such beings would behave. It is only for beings like us, who are also tempted by inclinations, that the law of freedom appears as an imperative, prescribing what one ought to do: "This 'ought' is strictly speaking a 'will' that holds for every rational being under the condition that reason in him is practical without hindrance" (GMS 4:449).

Dignity, then, is not *part* of this grounding. Instead, "dignity"—in this usage—*describes* that human beings are special in nature in virtue of having freedom. By itself, "dignity" merely expresses that human beings are special. But other animals can be special: a centipede has the most feet, a cheetah can run the fastest. However, what makes them special has no bearing on morality. In contrast, freedom is the source of morality. Since the source of morality is in one's own freedom, something Kant calls "autonomy," autonomy is what makes human beings special: "*Autonomy* is therefore the ground of the dignity of human nature and of every rational nature" (*GMS* 4:436). Autonomy and dignity describe different aspects of freedom. But morality is grounded in freedom itself.

## Comparison

In concluding, I want to compare Kant's conception of dignity to the three features of our contemporary notion of dignity that I specified at the beginning. There I had said that the following are now considered to apply to dignity (1) it is a value or objective preciousness all human beings possess equally; (2) this standing gives one the right to make second-personal claims on others (e.g., for an apology), and (3) this standing gives the right to demand a special treatment from others (e.g., that the other look one in the eye while apologizing).

Concerning (1), I noted that—unlike the contemporary conception of dignity—Kant does not ground morality in a third-personal fact (of being valuable), but rather in a first-personal law of one's own reason (the Categorical Imperative). On Kant's account, the right (Categorical Imperative) is prior to the good (or any value): "For,

nothing can have a worth other than that which the law determines for it" (GMS 4:435f ). One has a moral standing or dignity because the Categorical Imperative commands that one should be respected (see the fourth section). This moral standing is equal among all human beings, but—as I have argued above—the standing is not the ground but the result of the requirement to be respected. The duty to respect others is therefore a duty to oneself, on Kant's account:

For I can recognize that I am under obligation to others only insofar as I at the same time put myself under obligation, since the law by virtue of which I regard myself under obligation [the Categorical Imperative] proceeds in every case from my own practical reason; and in being constrained by my own reason, I am also the one constraining myself. (MS 6:417f )

I should respect others, not because they have a value, but because it is commanded by the Categorical Imperative of my own reason.

Accordingly, in contrast to the second feature of the contemporary view of dignity (2), in Kant's view it is not a value or one's own dignity because of which one can make rights claims. Rather one can claim a right by reminding the agent of *his* duty (expressed by the Categorical Imperative of his reason) to respect the victim. On Kant's account, duties are prior to rights:

But why is the doctrine of morals usually called (especially by Cicero) a doctrine of *duties* and not also a doctrine of *rights*, even though rights have reference to duties?—The reason is that we know our own freedom (from which all moral laws, and so all rights as well as duties proceed) only through the *moral imperative*, which is a proposition commanding duty, from which the capacity for putting others under obligation, that is, the concept of right, can afterwards be explicated. (MS 6:239)

One can claim a right by reminding the agent of his duty:

The other, having a right to do so, confronts the subject with his duty, i.e., the moral law by which he ought to act. If this confrontation makes an impression on the agent, he determines his will by an Idea of reason, creates through his reason that conception of his duty which already lay previously within him, and is only quickened by the other, and determines himself according to the moral law. (*Kant's Lectures on Ethics Vigilantius*, 27:521)

Finally, unlike the third feature of the contemporary view of dignity (3), Kant does not specify the particular way in which one has to respect others. On Kant's account, these ways could be very different in different cultures (cf. *Kant's Lectures on Ethics Collins*, 27:466). Kant wants to confine himself to what he can say about morality a priori. One could imagine that looking someone in the eye could be a sign of respect in one culture, but an insult in another. What counts as respect in one culture needs to be found out empirically:

The different forms of respect to be shown to others in accordance with differences in their qualities or contingent relations differences of age, sex, birth, strength or weakness, or even rank and dignity, which depend in part on arbitrary arrangements—cannot be set forth in detail … in the *metaphysical* first principles of a doctrine of virtue. (MS 6:468, cf. 468f )

In sum: On the contemporary account of dignity the good (the value of human beings) is prior to the right (the principle that one should respect others), and the right of the victim is prior to the duty of the agent. Kant turns both relationships around. The right (Categorical Imperative) is prior to the good, and the duty of the agent is prior to the right of the victim. Universal dignity is not itself part of this foundation, on Kant's account, but it describes (*a*) that rational beings are

special in nature in virtue of possessing freedom, (*b*) that all human beings are special because they should be respected, as required by the Categorical Imperative, and (*c*) what should be respected in others, their striving to realize their initial dignity (cf. note 6).

Kant is the inspiration for the contemporary paradigm of dignity, but—if I am right—not its author. This does not weaken the contemporary paradigm, but it opens up a further way of how one can justify the requirement to respect all human beings.

# *Reflection*: A Time for Dignity 
*Charles W. Mills*

No philosopher is more celebrated than Immanuel Kant for his theoretical emphasis on the importance of *dignity* for our moral identities as human beings, or, more generally, persons. In these brief reflections, I want to raise some questions about this very familiar picture, and how it might need to be complicated once we take race into account.

In a series of essays beginning in the 1990s, various philosophers—Tsenay Serequeberhan, Emmanuel Eze, Mark Larrimore, Robert Bernasconi, Pauline Kleingeld, and others brought back to the discipline's attention the embarrassing fact that Kant was a racist and indeed has a good claim to be regarded as the founder of modern "scientific" racism.1 Thus the famous theorist of personhood also turns out to be a pioneering theorist of subpersonhood, at least in its modern form. (Other forms of racism, such as the theological and cultural, have been argued by some commentators to be much older, dating back to the classical epoch.)2 Kant demarcated humanity into a four-tier

hierarchy—Europeans, Asians, blacks, Native Americans—and, during his racist period, supported European colonialism and judged blacks and Native Americans to be natural slaves.3

Clearly, then, in a moral theory for which *autonomy*, the capacity for self-legislation and self-direction, is so crucial, it would be difficult to see such creatures as genuinely capable of dignity. Mainstream Kantians have generally either ignored this seeming contradiction in Kant's work or acknowledged it only in passing, while continuing on basically as before. I want to suggest here a different strategy by asking the question: how should a deracialized Kantianism (or Kantianism*) be reconstructed that would *take into account* this bifurcated racial history, this historic division in modernity between recognized persons (white) and persons not recognized as persons (e.g., blacks)?

For my belief is that to "continue as before" with a putatively "color-blind" assimilation of nonwhites to the white population in Kant's theoretical claims will only continue in a different form the *disrespect* showed by Kant and other white racist Enlightenment figures to people of color. Rather, we need to rethink how race affects personhood, dignity, respect, the *Rechtsstaat*, the temporality of history, as well as our duty to help bring about Kant's own cosmopolitan vision of a planetary "kingdom of ends." Facing the fact of a historically partitioned normativity requires us to explore and incorporate into a now modified apparatus the

Lott (Malden, MA: Blackwell, 2002), 145–66; and Pauline Kleingeld, "Kant's Second Thoughts on Race," *Philosophical Quarterly* 57, no. 229 (2007): 573–92. Controversy exists on whether, in addition to the familiar precritical and critical periodization of Kant, we also need a racist and antiracist periodization (not coincident with the former) to register the fact that Kant (allegedly) changed his mind on race. Pauline Kleingeld argues for such a change, located in the 1790s—"Kant's Second Thoughts on Race"—while Robert Bernasconi denies it: "Kant's Third Thoughts on Race," in *Reading Kant's Geography*, ed. Stuart Elden and Eduardo Mendieta (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2011), 291–318.

radically different experience of racially subordinated peoples in modernity and a correspondingly divergent mapping of time, a competing "sociomental representation of the past," in the phrase of Eviatar Zerubavel.4

Consider, after all, some classic characterizations of blacks' status under white supremacy: blacks as a "*tertium quid*," "somewhere between men and cattle" (W. E. B. Du Bois); blacks as "a race without respect" (Marcus Garvey); "colonization" as a process of "thingification" (Aimé Césaire); blacks as inhabitants of "a zone of non-being" (Frantz Fanon).5 Unlike the situation for white persons, it is indignity rather than dignity that is the "default mode." Ignoring this history does not erase it but perpetuates it, insofar as moral consciousness both white and nonwhite is likely to continue to be shaped by this legacy of differential moral regard (think of the implications of the literature on "implicit bias," for example), while sociopolitical structures both local and global will still reveal the colonial or neocolonial normative blueprint.

How then should this history be addressed? A valuable guide here is Thomas McCarthy's recent book, *Race, Empire, and the Idea of Human Development*, 6 which, recognizing the failure of philosophies of history inspired by the Hegelian World-Spirit or underpinned by Marxist economic determinism, judges that "Kant's insistence on the primacy of practical reason makes him more of a contemporary than either Hegel or Marx."7 But a renovated Kantian philosophy of history must, of course, reject not just his racism, but also his own dubious teleology.

"practical anthropology" of the *Metaphysics of Morals*, 8 which "deals with morally relevant differences among *subgroups within the species*, that is, differences that make a difference in regard to the duties owed them,"9 can then be rewritten via a new concept of "race" that makes it a matter of social construction rather than intrinsic biological differentiation. The significance of "race" is now transformed by its reconceptualization as a sociohistorical structure whose "phenomenal" power over human "inclination" has been so great that it has motivated some persons to deny the personhood of others, and create racist polities accordingly. In colonialism, in slavery, in white supremacy, we have systems of government that are not slightly deviant from the *Rechtsstaat* but founded on principles that are its direct antithesis, the using of whole groups of persons as mere means, ignoring their own ends: the *Rassenstaat*. Moreover, the legacy of this betrayal of the Categorical Imperative has not vanished with the formal elimination of these systems. Rather it is still with us today, in structures of domination predicated on the ongoing exploitation of racial "Others" and in patterns of moral cognition shaped not merely by the past but by the enduringly inferior position of these Others.

Now we know that the achievement of the kingdom of ends requires the participation of all humans. To exclude some will be in violation of Kant's prescriptions in the *Groundwork* about the demands of "dignity": "the *share* which it affords to a rational being *in the making of universal law*, and which therefore fits him to be a member in a possible kingdom of ends."10 In racist societies, people of color will have been denied this share in universal lawmaking, viewed as "natural slaves" for whom autonomy is impossible and heteronomy

is all they can achieve. A merely formal inclusion of them in the (nominally) postracist polity will not suffice to re-establish the republic on a just footing. Rather, a substantive inclusion is necessary, one that—in keeping with the demands of "publicity"—expressly acknowledges these past violations of personhood, and the need to make up for them. Thus the justice that is integral to the *Rechtsstaat* requires, where such historic violations have occurred, correction to make up for past injustices. The "morally relevant differences among subgroups" that should guide the applications of the Categorical Imperative will now track racial subordination, not racial biology, prescribing duties of remediation.

And it is here that we run into a problem, for neither in Kant nor the liberal tradition generally is there any systematic treatment of corrective justice. As Samuel Fleischacker has documented, liberalism—contra its self-image of principled commitment to the repudiation of ascriptive hierarchy and the equal worth of all persons—has systematically elevated some persons above others.11 Not until the 1790s' writings and speeches of François-Noël ("Gracchus") Babeuf, guillotined in 1797 for his membership in the "Conspiracy of the Equals," do we get a commitment even to universal *distributive* justice delinked from intra-whitemale social status, and even then, of course, it continues to be generally linked to the social statuses of gender and race.12 As for *corrective* justice for the systemically subordinated, it is virtually untheorized—a pattern that continues to this very day in the work of John Rawls and his commentators.13 The temporality implicit

in Kant's metaphysics of morals is what I have called elsewhere a "white time,"14 a "time map" (Zerubavel) that refuses to recognize the moral significance for history of the West's racial oppression of people of color, its denial of their equal personhood, and the challenge it raises for their achievement of (recognized) dignity within the global kingdom of ends.

I suggest, then, that a rethinking of the temporality of Kant's philosophy of history that would highlight the different experiences within modernity of white and nonwhite "persons," and corresponding white and nonwhite "times," would demand the reconstruction of an aggressively antiracist Kantian conception of "dignity" and radical corrective justice for those who have been systematically denied it. We know that Kant's philosophy of punishment (a particular variety of corrective justice) is famously uncompromising, condemning any guiding principle other than "the principle of equality."15 Were the "making of universal law" to be extended to include "equal" principles of corrective social justice grounded in the reclamation of their dignity by people of color for the indignities historically inflicted upon them by global white supremacy, the deontological implications for the transformation of the planet would presumably be equally uncompromising. *Fiat justitia ruat caelum!*

# Chapter 9: On Bourgeois Dignity - Making the Self-Made Man
*Christine Dunn Henderson*

Somewhere near the beginning of the eighteenth or end of the seventeenth century—the exact date is impossible to pinpoint, nor is it essential to what follows—a new concept of "dignity" was emerging. Taking hold first in the northern countries of Europe and quickly spreading to England, where a new socioeconomic class was coming to prominence, this idea of dignity emerged from the distinctive set of values and ideas associated with that class.1 The rising group was the bourgeoisie, a name that today is virtually inseparable from its Marxist connotations, but which had a less freighted origin in medieval and

<sup>1</sup> Iain Hampsher-Monk's "Liberty and Citizenship in English Political Discourse," in *Freedom and the Construction of Europe*, vol. 2: *Free Persons and Free States*, ed. Quentin Skinner and Martin van Gelderen (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), 105–27, argues—rightly, I think—for an earlier emergence of the "citizen," an idea that, particularly in terms of independence, can be later linked to the bourgeoisie I am describing. One could also point to the Renaissance humanists for the seeds of certain aspects of bourgeois dignity. My purpose here, however, is simply to describe this new notion of dignity, rather than to date its appearance.

late Latin: the *burgensis*, or simply, the free inhabitant of a city.2 Tied to neither land nor lord, freed from the obligations of feudalism, the bourgeoisie was commercial in orientation, and its rise ushered in a new understanding of virtue: the bourgeois virtues, a group of qualities describing the character traits and habits necessary for success in commercial life. Ennobling the middling, commercial way of life and the virtues associated with it is the essence of bourgeois dignity. This chapter will explore the development of a distinctive concept of bourgeois dignity in the eighteenth century, investigating first the key elements of the so-called bourgeois virtues that provided content to this new ethos of dignity. Next, it will probe the economic, political, and social conditions that facilitated the emergence and diffusion of bourgeois dignity, before briefly considering bourgeois dignity as a contested concept. Finally, it will discuss how this new understanding of dignity was refined and then diffused throughout British society by one of the most influential literary endeavors of the eighteenth century, Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's *The Spectator* (1711–1714).

First, however, a terminological clarification is necessary. Although we have come to call this emergent class the bourgeoisie, to speak of an eighteenth-century "bourgeoisie" or even a "middle class" risks anachronism. "Bourgeoisie" was occasionally employed to describe the urban middle classes in the eighteenth century, but the more common term was "middling," an adjective broad in its application. The "middling condition" encompassed a wide range of ways of life, from various professionals to the affluent merchant to the modest shopkeeper. What distinguished the middling class from the nonworking aristocracy on one hand, and the laboring, "mechanick" part of society (or the vulgar and coarse, urban-dwelling "cit") on the other, was that their activities not only "fed and clothed them," as historian Peter Earle

<sup>2</sup> The *OED* locates the first usage of "bourgeois" at the end of the sixteenth century; by the beginning of the nineteenth century, its application to the middle class had emerged, and in 1850, *The Communist Manifesto* emphasized an exploitative and pejorative dimension.

puts it, but "also enabled them to accumulate on a regular basis and so improve themselves" and their condition in life.3 As we will see, this increased economic power was accompanied by gradual increases in prestige, social standing, and, eventually, political power.

## The Bourgeois Virtues

The excellence or virtues proper to the broad group of individuals composing the middling condition were those that facilitated and sustained commercial life. The bourgeois virtues, then, began as instrumental virtues—character qualities conducive to a given material end. Over time, however, these qualities became desirable in their own right, and to possess them was to have one's moral standing elevated and dignified, both in the individual's own mind and within society at large. Benjamin Franklin's *Autobiography* illustrates the dramatic elevation the bourgeois virtues had experienced by the end of the eighteenth century. Of the thirteen moral virtues Franklin deemed essential to happiness and prosperity, seven are bourgeois virtues: temperance, order, resolution, frugality, industry, sincerity, and moderation. The *Autobiography*'s praises of order, frugality, and industry underscore the commercial context of these virtues' practice and their pragmatic character; Franklin's list of virtues advises, "Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time," "make no expense but to do good to others or yourself," and "lose no time; be always emply'd in something useful."4

Thus, we see that on the one hand, qualities such as thrift, work, honesty, foresight, temperance, moderation, independence, and selfimprovement had come to be classed squarely among the virtues by

the turn of the nineteenth century. On the other hand, such virtues were also distinctly bourgeois, and the connections between many of these traits and the habits and skills required for successful commerce are easily enough drawn.5 To save enough capital to expand his business, for example, the merchant must be thrifty, while honesty—which becomes sincerity when writ large in society—is an essential attribute for the merchant who wishes to secure return customers and a favorable reputation. Similarly, foresight is indispensable to the long-range planning necessary for successful commercial endeavors, and it is particularly important for merchants wishing to improve their condition by expanding their business activities. More indirect connections can also be drawn to account for some of the less obvious virtues. For example, predictability or regularity of character is an essential precondition for foresight's operation, since what it regular, predictable, or even standardized is more easily foreseen than what is contingent or unique.6 Here we can also glimpse the importance of a distinctly bourgeois temperance and moderation—that is, a species of temperance that is not so much "moral" in origin as utilitarian and "commercial."

The bourgeois way of life is built around individuals, and particularly around the idea of the individual, understood outside the contexts of family, clan, or faith group. During this period of bourgeois ascent, this burgeoning individualism manifests itself in a variety of culturalpolitical ways that created cycles of reciprocity that further enhanced the individual's standing and, as we will see more clearly, his dignity.7 Within the context of the bourgeois virtues, this new individualism manifests as a particular esteem for self-reliance or independence.

<sup>5</sup> The rough classification that follows is a gross oversimplification. For example, connections between what I describe as personal qualities and what I call framing qualities clearly exist, but focusing on those interconnections would be distracting and would not, I think, add to the explanations of the various qualities' content.

<sup>6</sup> For similar reasons, predictability of the world is also desirable. See the discussion below of the knowledge culture out of which bourgeois dignity emerges.

<sup>7</sup> See below.

Most obviously, self-reliance can be understood in terms of economic independence, but it has other dimensions as well, two of which are particularly worthy of mention. The first is independence of judgment. With neither lord nor master, the bourgeois forms his own opinions and judgments about the world he experiences around him. Second is the related quality of "self-making." Again, bound to no one and responsible for his own fate, the bourgeois can make of himself whatever he wills. Thus, in some sense, the "test" of the individual's abilities (i.e., his or her general character) becomes the ability to rise in station and to succeed in life *through his or her own efforts*. The greater the rise and success, the greater the individual's abilities and overall merit.8 The independence of these self-made men is captured in Frederick Douglass's description of them as indebted only "to themselves for themselves."9 Similarly, one aspect of Addison and Steele's work in *The Spectator*, which we will explore in greater detail later, is the creation indeed, the self-creation—of a certain kind of "polite" individual and the cultivation of the independent judgment required for citizens of Great Britain's burgeoning commercial society.

A variety of background societal value-shifts attest to the changing assessment of these personal characteristics. Consider, for example, the new dignity bestowed on the idea of work in the eighteenth century, and with it, the quality of being hard-working or industrious (ideas that would be put to radical political use under the rubric of the "dignity of labor" in the nineteenth century).10 Valuing work contrasts to the lauding of leisure in older systems of ethics and reflects a society in which it was possible to improve one's station in life and in which work was one key to that improvement. Writing at the end of the eighteenth century, Mary Wollstonecraft

hints at another dimension of work's value, proclaiming that work "dignifies the mind."11 Wollstonecraft thus captures the dual nature of the bourgeois understanding of work, for work becomes both a means and, in a certain sense, an end. One effect of this new valuation of work is that a kind of worldly pragmatism, with its direct connections to the practical knowledge required in daily economic life, comes to be esteemed in this period above purely theoretical knowledge.

The rise of the bourgeoisie and the new premium it placed on the individual is also accompanied by a thorough reevaluation of selfinterest. Beginning from the Mandevillean perspective that views self-interest as a vice yielding socially beneficial results, the way was prepared for a rehabilitation of self-interest as both a dependable and a laudable force for good. What is true of self-interest was true of other qualities, and indeed, by the end of the eighteenth century, the bourgeois understanding of goodness and decency did not require eliminating many of the hitherto "standard" sources of vice usually associated with self-interest—such as acquisitiveness or cupidity—but instead sought to channel and reorient these desires and passions so that they might be useful both to the individual and to society at large.

Some less obvious qualities—that is, qualities not directly in the service of individual self-interest, like temperance or marital fidelity—also formed part of the bourgeois virtues, by indirectly helping to create a stable private basis supporting the bourgeois' commercial activities in the public sphere. Similarly, the ideals of conjugal and familial love, whose rising currency maps fairly neatly onto the ascent of the bourgeoisie, can be viewed as supporting the types of family units and living arrangements that were most conducive to middle-class economic prosperity. Respectability and decency fall into this category as well, with the understanding that

<sup>11</sup> Mary Wollstonecraft, *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (London: J. Johnson, 1792), 240.

the reputation for these qualities enhances the social standing and reputation of the holder, while possessing the substance of each of them may also provide one with habits conducive to commercial success.12

Finally, several components of the bourgeois ethos can be understood as framing the type of society in which commerce thrives. First and foremost of these "general framing" components, and following from the ideas of independence and individualism, was a certain type of egalitarianism. This egalitarianism assumed its most obvious political form in the gradual increase of democratic elements within the British political system during the period of bourgeois ascent, making itself felt in social relations within the polity as well. The exceptional permeability of the English gentry and the movement of younger sons of the nobility into the worlds of business and trade also accelerated the process of "dignifying" commerce and the commercial way of life. Thus, Earle notes that by the early eighteenth century, "it is clear that the younger son of a gentleman who went into trade did not for that reason lose all of his gentility, even though he was unable to be as idle as his elder brother." Plainly, "Trade did not defile a gentleman" in eighteenth-century England, and the mutual regard across classes that was strengthening signifies the emergence of a new concept of dignity, one that was more accessible and more inclusive than earlier notions had been.13

Another key element framing the bourgeois virtues at the general societal level is toleration: as Montesquieu famously observed, commerce softens and gentles mores, encouraging communication and peace among peoples.14 In other words, trade between individuals or nations who differ requires that the trading partners forsake going to

<sup>12</sup> Mandeville, of course, sees qualities such as marital fidelity as sham virtues, disguising vices that are themselves publicly beneficial.

war to settle those differences, and that they be willing to tolerate different ways of life, beliefs, and values for the sake of the mutual advantage gained through commerce. What Shaftesbury writes of liberty was thus thought to be true of commerce as well—that "we polish one another, and rub off our corners and rough sides by a sort of amicable collision."15 In addition to the broader and more frequently discussed applications of toleration to matters such as religion, we note that two forms taken by toleration in this period were paradigmatic eighteenthcentury virtues: civility and the related idea of politeness.16

## The Rise of the Bourgeoisie

Without entering into debates raging among historians and economists about why the middle class or bourgeoisie arose during this period and without wading too deeply into the complex relations of ideas, technology, institutions, and economics, it seems incontestable that the development and rise of a middle class is partly attributable to the focus placed by the Scientific Revolution and the Enlightenment on knowledge, and specifically the focus on technical knowledge.17 With the expansion of print culture, technical and practical knowledge was more easily preserved and shared, thus fueling additional advances. Diderot's *Encyclopédie* is perhaps the most famous example of the diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge, but there were many similar avenues of transmission. International commerce, for example, played a similar role in diffusing scientific and technical

<sup>15</sup> Shaftesbury, *Characteristicks of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times*, vol. 1 (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2001), 42. For Shaftesbury, this buffing liberty is also the source of all politeness.

<sup>16</sup> For a more extended discussion of politeness, see below.

<sup>17</sup> On these debates, see, for example, Joel Mokyr, *The Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain, 1700–1850* (New Haven: Yale University Press), 2009; Deirdre N. McCloskey's multivolume set on the bourgeoisie *The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006) and *Bourgeois Dignity: Why Economics Can't Explain the Modern World* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2010); L. E. Birdzell Jr. and Nathan Rosenberg, *How the West Grew Rich: The Economic Transformation of the Industrial World* (New York: Basic Books, 1987).

knowledge and in fueling innovation, a fact that both illustrates the interconnectedness of these factors and underlines the impossibility of giving a single-factor account. As Mokyr observes, "The British were rarely coy about utilizing foreign ideas or about reverse-engineering imported inventions. Trade created so-called *exposure effects*, inspiring imitation and innovation through the observation of what foreigners could do."18 Scientific clubs and societies also began to proliferate during this period, thus putting theoretical scientists and technical experts in greater contact with their peers and encouraging a culture that promoted innovative applications of theoretical knowledge to the practical world, eventually including the key technological developments of the Industrial Revolution.19

Mirroring the improvements in the arts and sciences, this same period also saw "improvements" in the science of politics, particularly in terms of the diminution of royal prerogative following the Glorious Revolution. The post-1688 political structure—itself growing out of philosophic roots that included Protestantism and the natural rights theories of John Locke and others—curbed the arbitrary power of the Crown, giving greater authority to Parliament. Diminishing royal prerogative and augmenting parliamentary power began a process of politically acknowledging the people. Although power remained concentrated in the hands of élites, the 1689 Bill of Rights nevertheless guaranteed certain individual rights such as freedom of expression, while ending various royal abuses such as arbitrary taxation and property seizure. As famously argued by Douglass North and Barry Weingast, the post-1688 redesign of fiscal and governmental institutions made credible the regime's commitment to property rights, and

this commitment was reflected in the growth of free markets and in the successful economic performance that followed.20

Whatever the exact timing and causal mixture among the various intellectual, cultural, and political factors, the economic effects were felt relatively quickly. By the early eighteenth century, Britain was already a comparatively prosperous economy, with income per capita and living standards well above those of all other European countries except the Netherlands (the other home of the bourgeoisie); multiple urban centers of significant size; extensively developed domestic and international trade; and a high level of agricultural productivity that made it possible for the agricultural class to require as little as 30 percent of the total labor population, about half that of other European countries, again with the exception of the Netherlands. A significant portion of the remaining 70 percent of the population could be categorized as of the "middling" condition, living above subsistence levels, augmenting their holdings, and consuming nonessential goods. While the "middling sort" might not yet have been conscious of itself as a distinct class, its growth fueled further developments in economics and led to the emulation of its values and practices by other social groups.21

The complex interplay of changes in the scientific/technical, cultural, political, and economic arenas led to sociological shifts. In particular, with the rise of the middling station came changed assessments of the bourgeois way of life and values. Qualities once disdained became praised, bourgeois values were transformed into virtues, and the bourgeois way of life gradually came to be thought worthy of emulation. As these new cultural norms were shaped, new tastes and vocabularies gained currency, and a new ethos—one in which the bourgeois individual and the bourgeois way of life acquired status and

dignity—began to displace older points of view, disdainful of labor, commerce, and so on. Thus, Daniel Defoe would assert in *Robinson Crusoe* (1719), "The middle State … is the best State in the World, the most suited to Human Happiness."22 Deirdre McCloskey sums up this transition by stating, "An old class of town dwellers, formerly despised by the clergy and the aristocracy and the peasantry, began to acquire a more dignified standing, in the way people thought and talked about it, in European rhetoric about middle-class activities."23

## Critics of Bourgeois Life

Explicitly dignifying the bourgeois way of life and the qualities associated with it via public endorsement in the press or from the pulpit was, however, a contested matter during this epoch. Praising a life of work, accumulation, and thrift—much less the practice of these qualities in *commerce*—and holding the bourgeois way of life and its values as ideals to be emulated was a controversial notion, for the bourgeois outlook ran counter to the dominant model of aristocratic virtue and its own conception of dignity, which emphasized pride, leisure, honor, and chivalry.24 Although by the seventeenth century, the English landed class had become relatively entrepreneurial, its general attitude toward the merchant's way of life remained disdainful.25 The aristocratic concept of dignity was, of course, rooted in earlier traditions, and the dignity of the hardworking, bourgeois shopkeeper is equally far from the dignity of Aristotle's magnanimous man as from the Socratic, Stoic, or Roman ideals.

<sup>24</sup> See Remy Debes's introduction to this volume, which discusses the early modern "merit" connotation of dignity.

<sup>25</sup> The quip, "I made my money the old-fashioned way: I inherited it" comes to mind as exemplifying this mindset, as do scenes like Lady Catherine's disdain, in *Pride and Prejudice*, for the Gardiners simply because Mr. Gardiner is in trade.

The relationship between Christianity and the bourgeois way of life is a complex one. A first glance suggests tensions between the bourgeois/commercial acquisitiveness and the biblical prohibition against usury, as well as the Christian rejection of worldly goods, admonition against materialism, and elevation of the life of poverty. Yet some balance comes in the biblical condemnation of sloth—specifically in a context of not making profit—in the parable of the talents.26 Moreover, component aspects of bourgeois virtue and dignity, such as fidelity, temperance, and honesty, are plainly consistent with if not derived from Christian ethics. Similarly, both bourgeois dignity's egalitarianism and the associated expansion of the class of individuals considered dignified that we witness in this era seem in keeping with—indeed, are most likely derived from—a Christian understanding of the basic equality of man, as equally created by God.27 Finally, the Weberian theory of the Protestant ethic's essential role in the economic success of Protestant countries during capitalism's early stages of development offers another interesting, though controversial, explanation of why England and the Low Countries were quicker to adopt bourgeois values than their continental and Catholic neighbors.

Three additional perspectives critical of the bourgeois way of life also deserve brief mention here. Working chronologically, the first is Jean-Jacques Rousseau's complaint from *The Discourse on the Arts and Sciences*, made as the bourgeoisie was beginning its ascent. Rousseau argues that, far from dignifying its practitioner, the bourgeois lifestyle and values destroy the individual's independence and happiness, as well as authentic relations among humans more generally. The bourgeois way of life was one of dependency and debasement, not independence and dignity. A similar objection about instrumentalizing others can be lodged against the bourgeois from a slightly later, Kantian perspective,

<sup>26</sup> E.g., Exod. 22:25–27, Lev. 25:36–37; Deut. 23:20–21; Ps. 15:5, but also Col. 3:5, Luke 12, and Matt. 5 and 14:30.

<sup>27</sup> For a different take, see Bonnie Kent's "Human Dignity after the Fall" in this volume.

though the Kantian universalization of human dignity may at least partly rest upon the extension of dignity to greater numbers of people in the bourgeois era.28 Finally, contemporary communitarians such as Robert Bellah and Robert Putnam charge that bourgeois dignity masks a selfishness and extreme individualism that erode the social bonds essential to a good life. According to communitarians, bourgeois society is one in which "community dissolves into the cash nexus, need is subordinated to profit, culture gives way to acquisition, leisure is sacrificed to work."29

## Shaping Culture and Dignifying the Bourgeoisie: *The Spectator*

One of the key texts that helped popularize and legitimize the idea of bourgeois dignity was Joseph Addison and Richard Steele's coffeehouse periodical *The Spectator*. Begun in March 1711, *The Spectator* ran six times a week and was immensely popular, with conservative estimates placing the number of each edition printed between three and four thousand—though also rising as high as fifteen thousand, depending on the topic—and Addison himself estimating that at least twenty people read any single printed copy. As stated in its opening number, the periodical's express purpose was to reform society, "to enliven Morality with Wit, and to temper Wit with Morality … [to] have brought Philosophy out of the Closets and Libraries."30 With an audience that was primarily urban and of the middling condition, *The Spectator* accepted commercial society as a given; rather than endeavoring to reorient the commercial way of life, it sought to direct the values and behaviors associated with commerce in the direction of what the

eighteenth century called "politeness," a complex notion encompassing both political and moral discourse, with an emphasis on moderation, toleration, and civility in the name of social harmony among diverse but interdependent groups. This understanding of politeness is associated culturally with a friendliness to commercial activity and values, and politically with Whig politics. Analyzing Addison as a moralist of politeness, Lawrence E. Klein notes that "politeness involved mutual deference and respect…. Politeness did not require agreement, but it did require a variety of restraints…. One had to talk in such a way as to allow the process of talking to continue, even if no agreement was ever reached."31 Conceptually, the politeness advanced by *The Spectator* is related to bourgeois dignity, in that norms of politeness acknowledged the legitimacy of all points of view. From this acknowledgment of equal legitimacy, a kind of leveling of the moral status of persons can be inferred. The leveling implicit in politeness works in both directions—a kind of "leveling up" of the lower classes, as well as a "leveling down" of the upper classes. Politeness is thus a process of bringing different classes and viewpoints into harmony with each other; because of this, polite society also offered a model of a tolerant civil society in which disagreement could be productive rather than destructive.

Formal and substantive aspects of *The Spectator* worked together to dignify the bourgeois virtues and to popularize the concept of bourgeois dignity. On a most basic level, *The Spectator*'s very goal of shaping popular culture—both behavior and the beliefs underpinning behavior—in directions that dignified the bourgeois way of life and the qualities associated with that way of life reflects and legitimizes the kind of pragmatism associated with bourgeois virtue. Even more obviously, the mingling of classes within the papers' fictional Spectator

Klein, "Property and Politeness in the Early Eighteenth-Century Whig Moralists: The Case of the *Spectator*," in *Early Modern Conceptions of Property*, ed.

Club embodies the kind of mixing necessary in commercial society, as well as the egalitarianism and independence characterizing the bourgeois worldview. With members including figures such as country squire Sir Roger de Coverley, businessman Sir Andrew Freeport, army officer Captain Sentry, and the Clergyman, the Spectator Club represents a public sphere in which contact between various classes is contact among equals. In the Spectator Club, the merchant's point of view is as respected as the aristocrat's, and exchange between points of view results in general improvement: the nobility is purged of folly and encouraged to partake of the bourgeois virtues, and the commercial class is polished and elevated, transforming it from the ordinary "cit" to the dignified bourgeoisie.

The Spectator Club itself is thus a small-scale embodiment of what came to be known as "coffeehouse society": a tolerant, inclusive, and egalitarian public sphere in which social classes mingled and discussed matters of policy, religion, and taste. Steele notes, "The Coffee-house is the Place of Rendezvous to all who live near it, who are thus turned to relish calm and ordinary Life," and it was home to a broadly democratic swath of—often self-fashioned—individuals who were productive, tolerant, and moderate, and who were considered by Addison and Steele as "the worthier Part of Mankind."32 The phenomenon of coffeehouse society is widely regarded as central to the shaping and diffusion of bourgeois identity and ideals, and as these bourgeois virtues came to be respected in the coffeehouse just as in the marketplace, greater dignity was accorded to the bourgeois person and his or her way of life.33 This process of dignifying the bourgeoisie, in turn, reinforced and heightened a new ethos of dignity, one that—while not yet

<sup>32 <</sup>i>Spectator no. 49. Addison and Steele's praise of amiability can also be read in this context, for amiability enables individuals with different interests and different points of view to coexist peacefully (see *Spectator* no. 243).

<sup>33</sup> The key text on coffeehouse society and bourgeois identity is Jürgen Habermas's *The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry into a Category of Bourgeois Society* (1962), trans Thomas Burger and Frederick Lawrence (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 199). Habermas casts the coffeehouse as a public sphere between civil society and the state, in which discussion and debate of matters of common interest was guaranteed. This sphere emerged within the context of a market economy and developed into the locus of popular monitoring of state authority by the people.

universal—was more inclusive and more accessible than older notions of dignity.

In working to elevate the everyday, and to create and diffuse the concept of bourgeois dignity, Addison and Steele turn their attention to almost every quality associated with the bourgeois virtues, from the virtues closely associated with commerce to those that more generally frame and support commercial life, and from specific social characteristics to more general ideas related to the worth of the individual.

*The Spectator*'s praise of the qualities directly associated with commerce and perhaps the most explicit example of Addison and Steele's efforts to establish the concept of bourgeois dignity in the popular consciousness can be seen in the character of Sir Andrew Freeport.34 Simply by choosing to name the representative of commerce "Sir Andrew" rather than "Andrew," Addison and Steele ennoble and dignify the commercial way of life and the bourgeois virtues. Introducing Sir Andrew in the second paper, Steele describes him as "a Person of indefatigable Industry, strong Reason, and great Experience." Said to be "excellent company"—high praise in itself, given the centrality of sociability and politeness in *The Spectator*—and a worthy friend, Sir Andrew's thrift, diligence, and scrupulous honesty are emphasized in *The Spectator*'s opening portrait of him, as are his intelligence, judgment, probity, and lack of affectation. Elsewhere, his justice and fairness are singled out for praise, and he exemplifies the other qualities *Spectator* 283 cites as necessary for success in business: thrift, method, and order.

Sir Andrew, whose words are always heard by Mr. Spectator "with a particular Pleasure" and whose "Notions of Trade are noble and

<sup>34</sup> For direct praise of the commercial virtues, see, for example, *Spectator* nos. 193, 11, 174, 108, 257, and 287.

generous,"35 champions the benefits of the division of labor, advancing also a sophisticated understanding of the concept of interest that mirrors the rehabilitation of interest accompanying the rise of the bourgeoisie. In Sir Andrew's opinion, interest-based commerce enriches all trading partners and benefits the public as a whole, both by increasing the general standard of living and by usefully employing those who would otherwise be beggars. Through Sir Andrew, *The Spectator* argues that trade is a better source of power and national greatness than arms, asserting that commerce "knits" the various parts of the world together "in mutual intercourse" and that "true power is to be got by arts and industry."36 *The Spectator* is also careful to remind its readers of Sir Andrew's altruism and of the manner in which he uses his wealth to help and employ others, thus exposing readers again to the rehabilitation of self-interest, illustrating how what was once thought a vice could be a virtue serving the common interest and society's general improvement.37 Sir Andrew's example thus embodies of *The Spectator*'s view that "there are not more useful Members of the Commonwealth than merchants," and that their way of life is the "most advantageous" for the individual and for society as a whole.38

Looking beyond the portrait of Sir Andrew, the bourgeois virtues occupy privileged places in Addison and Steele's moral universe, with *The Spectator* touting their inherent desirability as well as the positive effects resulting from their possession or practice. Work and the virtue of industry receive generally high praise throughout *The Spectator*, with the papers repeatedly endorsing "honest industry" and the man of affairs.39 More particularly, Addison and Steele express a preference

<sup>35 <</sup>i>Spectator nos. 2 and 549. See also *Spectator* nos. 69 and 283, where the wealthy commercial class is described as most concerned with the commonwealth's "Quiet and Interest" and best suited for public service.

for allowing younger sons to engage in commerce, in order to improve themselves and their condition, rather than idling away on country estates. *The Spectator* also asserts that work or industry has nonmaterial benefits, arguing that industry (together with simplicity, innocence, and temperance) is a better source of tranquility than wisdom, and that "men of business and bustle in the world" are often more likely to enjoy serenity of body and mind than are philosophers.40 Decency, too, is elevated to become "Concomitant to Virtue" and is associated with order, constancy, mutual respect across classes, and moderation of both speech and conduct. Together with sincerity, decency emerges in *The Spectator* as the standard against which the actions and speeches of the day are judged and found wanting. Addison and Steele also laud temperance, placing it among the virtues and associating it with the type of commercial life that benefits the merchant and society. As endorsed by *The Spectator*, temperance includes both bodily continence and a more general self-possession; thus, it is affiliated with sobriety in a literal sense and with the moderation or "Sobriety of the Heart" that is described as "above all Pleasures."41 Finally, *The Spectator* elevates the bourgeois "framing" virtues of marital fidelity and conjugal love, casting domestic felicity as complementing and enhancing external esteem and respect, and as making the happy spouse a more agreeable companion outside of the home.42

Just as *The Spectator*'s content works to elevate the bourgeois life and to diffuse the new notion of bourgeois dignity, Addison and Steele's method also underlines the standing and dignity they attribute to the bourgeoisie. Perhaps most obviously, *The Spectator* operates by persuasion rather than preaching, engaging its middle-class readers as equals in the discussion and participants in its project of advancing bourgeois dignity. In its efforts to refine judgment and to create new standards

of taste and behavior, *The Spectator* operates on intellectual, affective, and habitual levels, with each complimenting the other—reason being reinforced by the force of emotion and by practice, sensibility being refined by rational argument and given additional grounding through practice, and so on. Erin Mackie comments that because Addison and Steele sought to change thinking as well as behavior, it was essential "that these moral reforms be *internalized* by the readers, that readers be persuaded, not coerced, into freely electing these standards of taste and behavior as their own."43 The papers themselves, then, reflect the ideas of self-making, self-reliance, and independent judgment that we have seen are reflections and byproducts of the idea of bourgeois dignity.

*The Spectator*'s praise of the "agreeable man" reflects something similar about the dignity Addison and Steele ascribe to the bourgeois condition. Described as content with his own position and as sincere and honest with those above and below him, the agreeable man embodies what is pleasing to "the Generality of Mankind." He is contrasted with two extremes—those who lord it over others and those who abase themselves before others. Via this contrast, *Spectator* 280 makes clear that the essence of this agreeableness is a confidence and "sincerity" derived from the individual's recognition of the equal dignity of his or her own position in the world. Hence, the *Spectator* also condemns forms of agreeableness resulting from "an artful plan" as well as agreeableness resulting in servility or cunning; instead, it endorses the constancy of "honest Natures."44

That such natures are found in both sexes and that bourgeois dignity itself is accessible to both sexes is also indicated by the fact that *Spectator* addresses itself to women as well as to men. *Spectator* 10 highlights its female readers, saying, "There are none to whom this Paper will be more useful than the female World."

deliberately cultivating a female audience seems to have been to show how empty lives devoted solely to fashion and vanity could be, and to induce women—as "reasonable creatures"—to engage in productive lives and in more serious forms of self-development and self-making.45 Indeed, the reforms to female education and female behavior advocated by Addison and Steele endeavor to cultivate judgment and to promote probity, moderation, seriousness, and self-possession among all classes of women, although admittedly still within a domestic context and still primarily with an eye to supporting the domestic harmony viewed as essential to peaceful life in modern society.

Despite its focus on the domestic sphere, this inclusion of women underlines the democratic or egalitarian aspect of the bourgeois dignity presented in the *Spectator*. For the authors of the *Spectator*, human nature does not differ according to one's position, and dignity inheres in the human condition. *Spectator* 70 bluntly asserts that "human nature is the same in all reasonable Creatures," making clear that reasonableness is found in all stations of life. The theme is echoed in *Spectator* 248's assertions that civic virtue and public spiritedness are attainable by and identical for all classes. Steele writes, "It is in every Man's Power in the World … not only to do Things worthy but heroic." He further praises a civil virtue founded on self-denial, asserting that "there is no one … but has Opportunities of exercising that noble Quality," before finally concluding that "Men of publick spirit differ rather in their Circumstances than their Virtue."46

While emphasizing the universality of human nature, *The Spectator* also reminds its readers of the role custom plays in creating artificial distinctions among men. Understood against a backdrop of universal human nature, custom can be seen as distorting nature and obscuring

from view the natural equality and inherent dignity of all men. In its project of elevating the ordinary life of the bourgeois, *The Spectator* works to correct these distortive customs and to encourage a culture in which natural equality among humans would be recognized and dignified.

Though its depiction of the coffeehouse itself and its praise of commercial life, *The Spectator* both shaped and reflected the cultural consequences of this new bourgeois ethos. The political consequences of this ethos would not be manifest for some time, but Addison and Steele were alert to them. Discussing the form of government "most conformable to the Equality that we find in Human Nature," *Spectator* 287 endorses a government of "Liberty, which exempts one Man from Subjection to another so far as the Order and Economy of Government will permit." A regime of liberty, which reflected individual equality and autonomy to pursue one's chosen ends with minimal interference, would include a mixed government with separated powers, bicameralism, and a weak executive.47 Such a regime was far from a reality when Addison penned the essay in 1712, but he and Steele already envisaged it as the political application of the concept of bourgeois dignity, which *The Spectator* worked to create and spread.

# *Reflection*: Taking Refuge from History in Morality: Marx, Morality, and Dignity
*Somogy Varga*

The Constitution of the Weimar Republic (1919) specified the institutional structures of the political system and laid down the fundament for a democratic welfare state. But it also went beyond a statement of traditional fundamental rights, linking the regulation of economic activity to the principles of justice and to a "dignified existence for all people."1 The fact that the concept of human dignity appears moderated behind the adjectival use2 is somewhat odd, but perhaps understandable given that pre-Weimar Germany both witnessed the remarkable rise of the concept of dignity with Kant and Schiller, and its most fierce denunciation by thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Marx, and Nietzsche.3

<sup>2</sup> Albeit moderated, its appearance in the context of a constitution and its link to rights is nevertheless remarkable, as it hasn't previously featured as a legal concept. See Jürgen Habermas, "The Concept of Human Dignity and the Realistic Utopia of Human Rights," *Metaphilosophy* 41 (2010): 468. See also McCrudden, "Human Dignity."

<sup>3</sup> Arguably, the adjectival use reflects that the constitution was itself, to a large degree, a compromise between liberal-democratic and Marxist ideologies with opposing views on the concept of dignity (and on moral vocabulary in general).

Among the critiques of dignity, it is perhaps Marx's view that has provided the most headache to scholars, partly because the general question whether Marx's theory has a moral dimension is one of the most controversial issues in Marx interpretation.4 The result is that—with a few exceptions5—Marx's view is often portrayed rather simplistically.6 Aiming to provide some clarification, this reflection will consider not only the general understanding of morality within historical materialism, but also a specific Kantian understanding of dignity that at least partly explains Marx's uncompromising view.

## Marx and Dignity: A Profound Ambivalence

Marx went to great lengths to express the bitterest criticism of bourgeois capitalist society while attempting to avoid anchoring his criticism in moral concepts. In addition to slogans like "Communists do not preach morality at all" in *The German Ideology*, he took pains to distance himself from fellow socialists who engage in a discourse of morality. A good example of this is found in his piece commenting on the work of another German socialist, Karl Heinzen, who described the rule of the

<sup>4</sup> See Lawrence Wilde, *Ethical Marxism and its Radical Critics* (London: Macmillan, 1998); Lawrence Wilde, introduction to *Marxism's Ethical Thinkers*, ed. L. Wilde (London: Palgrave Macmillan, 2001), 1–14.

Marcus Düwell, Jens Braarvig, Roger Brownsword, and Dietmar Mieth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2014), 126–34.

<sup>6</sup> Some of this is caused by general ambiguities about parts of Marx's stance on capitalism. It is beneficial to draw a parallel to Rousseau's attitude toward the kind of civilized social life he was confronted with in Paris. While Rousseau and Marx both despised the socioeconomic mechanisms they witnessed at play in their respective environments, they both regarded them necessary for the further development of human faculties. Thus, the overall attitude is not simply detestation, but bears witness of a profound ambivalence.

German princes as detrimental to the "dignity of man" (*Menschenwürde*). Marx writes:

Doughty "sound common sense" believes it explains the *rule of princes* by declaring itself *opposed* to it. The difficulty, from the standpoint of this norm of common sense, would, however, seem to consist in explaining how the opponent of sound common sense and of the moral dignity of man was born and how he dragged out his remarkably tenacious life for centuries. Nothing is simpler. The centuries did without sound common sense and the moral dignity of man. In other words, the sense and morality of centuries were in accordance with the rule of the princes instead of contradicting it.7

This passage provides a brief glimpse of Marx's motivations for adopting an uncompromising position. On the one hand, he entertained epistemic reasons for opposing formulating arguments against capitalism in moral terms on the grounds that this might undermine a clear-sighted scientific analysis.8 On the other hand, Marx was also convinced that the available moral vocabulary was compromised by its function of supporting prevailing power structures. Remarkably, he brings the abovequoted passage to a rhetorical culmination by forcefully suggesting that moral terms like dignity are little more than "empty phrases," and grounding social criticism amounts to "*taking refuge from history in morality*."9

<sup>8</sup> See Wilde, *Marxism's Ethical Thinkers*.

<sup>9</sup> It is worth noting that the question about the possible "emptiness" of the concept has returned. For an overview about the various forms in which skepticism about dignity occurs in contemporary discussion, see Michael Rosen, *Dignity: Its History and Meaning* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012), 1–11 (emphasis added).

It is not difficult to see that such a statement is in a strong tension with what Eugene Kamenka and others have identified as Marx's positive, even approving thoughts on human dignity, especially in his early years.10 Indeed, in the idealism of his (very) young years, Marx maintained that "dignity is that which raises man the most, which lends to his actions, to all his strivings, a higher nobility, which leaves him unimpaired, admired by the multitude and elevated above it."11 Later, Marx described the alienation of human beings in terms of their being robbed of their sense of self-worth, adding that alienated workers are people rendered "devoid of dignity." He maintains that the more value the worker creates, "the less value—the less dignity—he himself has," while in other places he opposes what he sees as a degradation (*Entwürdigung*) of human beings.12

From such passages, the impression is that a conception of dignity serves as a normative framework underpinning Marx's diagnosis of alienation—one that presupposes that a person can give form to her own abilities through autonomous labor. He vehemently opposes Adam Smith's view that labor always involves a sacrifice on the part of the worker, and that motivation is reducible to the achievement of external ends. Instead, Marx's point is that individuals in autonomous labor consciously exercise and expand their productive capacities ("species powers") as an end in itself. Such labor is experienced as inherently meaningful "partly

because through it they affirm both to themselves and to others their *dignity* as individuals and the worth of their lives and their humanity."13

In addition to central concepts such as alienation and labor, the concept of dignity also appears to be directly connected to the notion of class struggle. Honneth has argued that class struggle in the work of Marx is not simply a strategic battle to acquire goods or powers.14 Instead, it is understood as a form of moral conflict in which the oppressed class strives to ensure the social conditions for a type of autonomous work that grounds its dignity.15

In all, there is a rather manifest tension between Marx's positive and negative views on human dignity. However, as we shall see, this tension can be explained if we take into account some particular aspects in Marx's work.

## "Taking Refuge from History in Morality"

The fact that Marx bases his critique of capitalism on the claim that it frustrates many important goods like self-actualization, freedom, and a sense of dignity leaves us with a puzzle. Why is Marx's critique of capitalism at its base not a genuinely *moral* condemnation of capitalism? To provide a better understanding of this issue we need to take into account two issues: (1) the general understanding of morality within historical materialism and (2) the specific character of the Kantian notion of dignity that fuels Marx's

<sup>15</sup> See for instance chapter 23 in *Capital I* and Andreas Wildt, *Die Anthropologie des frühen Marx* (Hagen: Kurs der Fernuniversität, 1987). Lohmann's "Human Dignity and Socialism" rightly recognizes the role that the concept of dignity plays in Marx, but given Marx's underlying account of human self-realization, I think it might be too strong to claim that it "constitutes the encompassing normative standard of the Marxist critique of capitalism."

critical attitude. As we shall see, these issues are interlinked and connected to Marx's conviction that morality cannot be viewed as abstracted from concrete historical situations.

## *Morality and Historical Materialism*

Marx's understanding of the function of morality has its roots in the work of Hegel. Hegel understood the role of morality in history as mainly a conservative force that aims to preserve a particular societal form, and which extraordinary individuals help overthrow to make room for something new. Marx also thinks of morality as a chiefly conservative force, and he links it to the "superstructure" of a particular social order that is shaped by established relations of production (the sum of social relations specific to a particular mode of production that people must enter into). Very roughly, *historical materialism* comprehends morality and religion as supporting pillars of the "ideological superstructure" of society, and aims to explain their social influence by emphasizing their contribution to the economic realities of the societies in which they operate. As Marx often points out, particular religious and moral beliefs are functional ideologies, lending stability to social systems and assisting the enforcement of social relations that promote class interests and modes of production.16

Given the framework of historical materialism, it is intelligible that Marx rejects social criticism based on concepts like "dignity." Marx wants to resist claiming that individuals have something like a right to dignity, with some moral standard like justice commanding it, hence his critique of Heinzen as discussed earlier. From Marx's perspective, it makes little sense to reject alienation, enslavement,

<sup>16</sup> Engels formulates this quite precisely when he maintains that "men create their moral intuitions in the last instance out of the practical relations on which their class situation is founded—out of the economic relations in which they produce and exchange" (quoted in Wood, *Karl Marx*, 132).

and ideological distortion with recourse to moral norms, because the appropriate target of the criticism is the *whole* ideological framework of a given mode of production.17

## *Dignity and Social Practice*

There is, however, another important aspect that sheds light on Marx's reaction to Heinzen's use of the concept of dignity. Focusing on the prevailing Kantian understanding of dignity can help explain this. To anticipate, Marx's rejection of moral terms can at least partly be understood as expressing a disapproval of what Michael Rosen calls Kant's "Platonism" about morality.18

In the *Groundwork* Kant unfolds his view on dignity arguing that in the kingdom of ends, there are entities that have a price (and can hence be replaced by something else), and entities that have dignity (and hence admitting of no equivalent). The latter have "an intrinsic value, that is dignity…. Hence morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, is the only thing which has dignity."19 Put in different terms, while laws determine the conditions under which something can count as a value, "The law-making which determines all value must for this reason have a dignity—that is, an unconditioned and incomparable worth."20 Dignity is thus the ground of human nature's unconditional, incomparable value that all human beings possess. As carriers of the moral law within themselves, human beings are somehow lifted beyond the natural world, and dignity is depicted as sublimity

<sup>17</sup> Consistently, Marx does not maintain that communism would be a just form of society, and he denies that capitalist exploitation is intelligible as injustice or the violation of certain rights.

(*Erhabenheit*), which is the highest elevation.21 Importantly, in contrast to things with a derived value determined by the market forces of supply and demand (that lastly derive from human goals), "dignity" is incomparable and *nonderived*. 22

From Marx's point of view, this view is both suspect and fundamentally misguided. The main reason is that such an account mistakenly conceives of moral value as deriving from outside of history and the social practices of a community. Marx thinks that one should resist any moral concept or principle *that is conceived independently of the ruling economic relations.* Such moral vocabulary, if presented as stemming a priori from laws of reason, masks the real basis of its norms, which are historically contingent social forms. It is on such background that he claims that any social criticism based on concepts like "dignity" is not only mistaken and deemed to be ineffective, but also demonstrates an uncritical and superficial intellectual attitude that "takes refuge from history in morality."

## Conclusion

Marx's outlook on morality and dignity is a complex and controversial issue that is often portrayed fairly unsophisticatedly. Some of the confusion can be traced directly back to Marx's ambiguous formulations, but some of it is simply expressive of the fact that Marx hasn't provided a full and systematic account

<sup>21</sup> Oliver Sensen provides a different interpretation of "dignity" in Kant, arguing that Kant to a certain extent actually relies on a Stoic conception. See Oliver Sensen, "Kant's Conception of Human Dignity," *Kant-Studien* 100 (2009): 309–31; Oliver Sensen, *Kant on Human Dignity* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2011), and Senen's contribution to this volume. His point is that contrary to what the most well-known passages suggest, Kant does not think of dignity as an inner value, but merely as the elevation of something over something else. In other words, "dignity" is the relational property of being elevated.

<sup>22</sup> This might at first appear puzzling since Kant posits a strong link between the capacity for morality and dignity and simultaneously maintains that the moral nature of human beings comes from our having been created by God as free beings. However, Rosen rightly notes that Kant's account of dignity doesn't depend on God, as it did in Aquinas. In fact, Kant allows that we can know moral nature independently of our beliefs about God and takes thus steps toward a secular understanding of dignity (Rosen, *Dignity*, 24–25).

of the normative standards that are inherent in his criticism. Shedding more light on Marx's uncompromising view and the tension between Marx's positive and negative views on human dignity, this contribution briefly investigated the status of moral terms like dignity within historical materialism, contrasting it with the Kantian understanding of dignity. The discussion presented here remained neutral on the question whether Marx's criticism succeeds, or whether it is inconsistent with the main credos of historical materialism.23

<sup>23</sup> Marx offers a powerful criticism of moral concepts by providing a historical materialist analysis, but provides no systematic account of the normative fundament of his criticism. However, it is debatable to what extent we should think of this strategy as failed. If Marx is right in at least some cases about the functional role of morality, then any form of social criticism guided by traditional moral terms has at least to take his criticism into account.

# Chapter 10: Universalizing Dignity in the Nineteenth Century
*Mika LaVaque-Manty*

In this chapter, I consider three instances in the universalization of dignity. To use a genealogical metaphor, we might call them snapshots from the family album of dignity. The first is about gender, the second about labor, and the third about race. These instances are not, in themselves, the junctures a historian might want to identify as the moment when something fundamentally changed, but they are examples, indeed exemplary moments. By describing what we see in those snapshots we can understand a little better how, in 1948, human dignity is enshrined as inherent in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights when 150 years earlier the idea seemed audacious.

To explore the "universalization" of a moral or political value is to explore a process by which the value gains a certain "taken-forgrantedness." I use the awkward phrase of taken-for-grantedness to distinguish universalization from two other meanings the concept might have. For something to become universal in the sense I use it does not mean that everyone subscribes to the idea or that it is uncontroversial. That is, arguably, not true in 1948—nor even now. It also does not mean that everyone understands what the concept means. If that were the case, this volume would not be necessary. Rather, I mean something admittedly imprecise but intelligible. By mid-twentieth century, dignity has become universal in the sense that it is the leading game in town: to deny the idea that every human being deserves respect by virtue of his or her inherent dignity will raise more eyebrows and objections than to affirm it.

Universalization, then, means something about the general reception of the concept, not its scope. That is, if I say, "Every human being has inherent dignity," but almost everyone disagrees with me, the scope of my concept might be universal, but concept itself isn't. Indeed, many people did say things that seemed to imply a universal scope for human dignity, long before 1948. For example, when Abraham Lincoln writes to Albert Hodges in 1864, "I am naturally anti-slavery. If slavery is not wrong, nothing is wrong," he can be seen as implying an inherent inviolability and respect-worthiness of human beings.1 But the view is far from universal. Indeed, he writes as the commander in chief in a brutal conflict, in which one side's raison d'être is the denial of Lincoln's position.

How do we get to universalization, then? Many philosophers would like to think it is through the power of the better argument. Historians, even those who do believe that ideas and values matter, often tell us it is more complicated. For example, Thomas Haskell has argued—albeit controversially—the combination of global trade and ordinary people's understanding that their behavior was part of the causal chain of slavery explains what popularized abolitionist sentiments in the nineteenth

<sup>1</sup> Abraham Lincoln, *Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln*, vol. 7 (Rutgers, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 282.

century.2 Or, as James Oakes has argued, the contradictions between slave-owner ideology—"Slaves are inferior humans"—and policy codes of conduct that presupposed the same intellectual and physical competencies among African American slaves as among white Americans—made abolitionist critiques powerful.3

While these two examples do suggest that it is more than the power of the better argument that changes minds, they also suggest that *conceptions* of values matter. Conceptual change, then, the familiar domain of philosophers, need not be separate, and indeed might not be separable, from politics.

I begin this chapter on the universalization of human dignity with the examples involving slavery deliberately. If the Kantian principle, treat others as ends in themselves and never as means only, is one of the foundational moments of modern dignity, then a practice in which another is treated as a fungible piece of property is the starkest possible violation of the principle.4 Indeed, the problem of slavery sets the relevant backdrop for this chapter, by pointing to a central aspect of my argument: contingent political struggles are inseparable from the conceptual, philosophical questions of how dignity came to be universal.

The nineteenth century is a key period in this development. On the one hand, this is when the *idea* that dignity is an inherent feature of personhood begins to gain widespread expression. On the other hand, the idea was as yet far from universally recognized, as I already pointed out. Slavery is the starkest example of this shortfall, but it is but one of many illustrations that many nineteenth-century social and political practices effectively denied the recognition of inherent human dignity.

<sup>3</sup> James Oakes, *Slavery and Freedom: An Interpretation of the Old South* (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1990).

<sup>4</sup> This book appropriately challenges the centrality of Kant's thought in dignity talk, but Kant nevertheless remains important in any meaningful discussion of dignity.

If dignity grounds respect, as we tend to think it does, large swathes of humanity seemed to lack it in the nineteenth century: slaves whether race-based or other types of slavery—women, and all "the lower orders": workers, the poor, and the like.

Several philosophical questions motivate the exploration of dignity's universalization. Did the political struggles persuade people to discover what was there all along or did they create something new? Was dignity like DNA: an inseparable part of human makeup, simply in need of scientific sophistication—or "civilization"—to be discovered? Or was it like the knowledge and skills required to be a computer programmer: a contingent property that is both possible and necessary only when a certain degree of development has been achieved?

This chapter does not, maybe unfortunately, provide an answer to these questions. Instead, it explores these questions and argues, first, that they involve a philosophically interesting political paradox. Although our modern conception tends to view dignity as an *inherent* feature of personhood, universalizing the idea has had to rely on making *contingent* and *noninherent* attributes of persons the grounds for why someone should be regarded as having dignity. This is abstract; I will spell it out in more concrete detail below.

There is a further philosophically interesting tension in the claim of inherent dignity that emerged in the nineteenth century concerning the relation between its moral and political conceptions. If everyone has dignity, what exactly does that dignity entail a claim to? We might ask a variant of Amartya Sen's famous question, "Equality of what?": what kind of equality is the equality of dignity? I suggest, at least conjecturally, that the political disagreements around this question help solidify equal dignity as a *moral* property and *thereby* weaken its political bite. Nineteenth-century debates result in a tension between the arguments that equal dignity ought to entail political equality, on the one hand, and arguments that it actually justifies existing social and political hierarchies. That tension remains unsolved by the time dignity begins to be treated as universal; there is agreement only on dignity as a moral

standing, but not on what it entails politically. But if so, then it should not surprise us that, by 1948, equal human dignity gets enshrined as a universal right. It is not surprising—because what gets enshrined is not a radical political idea, but a far less controversial moral idea. Or so I will suggest.

I do not, of course, suggest that dignity as a kind of moral standing cannot be politically powerful. On the contrary, the discussions I will canvas here show it can be. Moreover, its value to civil rights movements after 1948—my symbolic cutoff year in this chapter—suggest it remains a powerful political resource. But, as we will also see, not a simple one.

Before we explore the three snapshots of gender, labor, and race, it will help first describe the general mechanism by which dignity becomes universalized at the exemplary moments.

A final quick word about terms. "Nineteenth century" in this chapter means something a little looser than the years 1801–1900. "The Long Eighteenth Century" is a familiar historical concept; for my purposes the nineteenth is also long, extending from the period after the French Revolution to the First World War.

## The Logic of the Politics of Dignity

The politics of dignity relies on the following strategic logic: using embedded values to *model* new values. For the modeling to have a chance of success, there have to be some possible grounds on which the introduction of the novelty might make sense. Because putting the matter like this is hopelessly abstract, consider the following example. I draw it from my prior work on a specific politics of respect around the problem of dueling.5

<sup>5</sup> Mika LaVaque-Manty, "Dueling for Equality: Masculine Honor and the Modern Politics of Dignity," *Political Theory* 34, no. 6 (2006): 715–40, doi:10.1177/0090591706291727. The example I discuss comes from Ute Frevert, *Men of Honour: A Social and Cultural History of the Duel* (Oxford: Polity Press, 1995).

In the nineteenth-century German university, dueling (largely its nonlethal variety) was the standard mode for male students to establish their extracurricular bona fides, their contemporary street cred. When the emancipation of Jews in Germany also led to the admission of Jews into universities and to the creation of Jewish student organizations, gentile student organizations banned dueling with Jews. This bit of anti-Semitism was just a small part of the thoroughgoing anti-Semitism that helped continue discriminatory practices, despite the official "emancipation."

Where things got interesting, however, was that occasionally, a Jewish student would challenge a gentile to a duel. The historical record is far from perfect on this score, but it is not difficult to imagine that general anti-Semitism often became particular in such a case, with the gentile refusing along the lines of, "You, Jew, are beneath my contempt. I don't fight with the likes of you." One key feature of dueling, since its emergence out of trial by combat in the late Middle Ages, was that duelers, by definition, were formal equals. The right to settle disputes with the extralegal means of a duel was a privilege originally accorded to warrior nobles. Thus, prior to the nineteenth century, to refuse to fight a duel with an unequal, that is, to acknowledge a challenge from him, would not have been surprising. Indeed, the history of dueling has plenty of anecdotes of "silly" challenges from unequals and of duels among those who were not entitled to them (such as craftsmen or, God forbid, women).

But by the nineteenth century, the haughty gentile's refusal may have sounded a bit hollow. Jews had been officially emancipated, after all: the law was that they were equals, at least in some respects. Similarly, the rhetoric of human equality at least since the French Revolution had been gaining ground. Jews were not universally recognized, but the idea that they *should* be recognized was in the air.

How did that make a difference? The status that a man would maintain by fighting a duel was his honor qua a courageous man willing to face physical peril. Sure, for the student duelers, the peril wasn't a

violent death, but generally just a scar (which had its positive externalities when it came to dating, historians tell us), but the idea of courage was there: a dueler was someone who was brave. So when a Jewish student challenged a gentile, and the gentile tried to dismiss him, the former might reply, "Ah, you are just a coward." Contained in that would have been a broader message, translated into twenty-first-century language: "You claim you don't see me as an equal. But it's reasonable of me to insist you treat me as one. And if you refuse, in this particular context, I probably should just conclude *you* don't deserve the respect you insist. So, *en garde*, you gutless wimp."

This, then, is what I mean by the strategy of using embedded values to model new values. The relationship of respect among existing equals—the embedded value that nobles, by virtue of their equal *status* were allowed to duel, for example—could be insisted on by political challengers: "Let us show that we, too, do actually have the character traits that earn you the respect you accord one another." Key here is that there is (*a*) an existing mode of respect that gets modeled to bring in new modes of respect and (*b*) some prior rhetoric that makes the demand intelligible, even if not automatically self-evident or universally accepted.

Let us express the logic in more theoretical language. Consider Stephen Darwall's helpful distinction between recognition respect and appraisal respect.6 Recognition respect is something I accord you simply on the basis of who you are, by virtue of your identity. Appraisal respect is something I accord you on the basis of how well you do something I care about. For example, suppose I am an academic snob who thinks philosophers, for whatever reason, are special. You sit next to me at a coffee shop or on an airplane. I'm inclined to ignore you while I mind my valuable business, until you pull out your computer and begin grading philosophy papers, or take out a page proofs for an

article in *Ethics*. I recognize you as a fellow philosopher before I know anything else about you and (for better or for worse) respect you as one. Contrast this to a domain where your ability to do something is the reason for my respect. Everyone and her uncle is a recreational runner these days, I might think, so my finding out that you run the occasional 5K does not much matter when I am introduced to you at a party. But when I discover that you run a 5K under sixteen minutes, which would make you a decent varsity-level collegiate athlete (and significantly faster than me), I suddenly accord you some new respect. This is based on my appraisal of your abilities, not on the recognition of who you are.

What I am proposing is an argumentative logic that challenges a neat division between recognition and appraisal respect. Instead, the idea is that recognition respect may be tied up in appraisal (I recognize you as a fellow honorable man *if* you demonstrate your courage) and that appraisal respect may at least on some occasions help establish recognition respect (I *can*, too, fight you at swords, so you'd better recognize me as an equal).

My discussion so far has been about respect, which is inherently connected to discussions of dignity. But it is not the same thing. So let us turn to how the logic I have described figures in the context of dignity.

## The Multivocality of Dignity

The premise of this chapter, like that of this entire book, is that dignity is not the same as equality, respect, worth, respect-worthiness, status, or standing, even though it is related, sometimes conceptually, sometimes practically, and sometimes even coextensively with one or more of these concepts. Another premise is that what matters is the *name* of the concept or, less philosophically, the word. My goal in this chapter is the very opposite of defining the concept or finding out or showing what it "really" means. Rather, I acknowledge that it is "multivocal": it can denote different, even opposite, but nevertheless related, things.

Let me elaborate. "Dignity" is multivocal in the sense that "liberal" is politically multivocal. Our explicitly political uses of the concept "liberal" are often confusing. In contemporary American political culture, it means someone who is on the political left. In theoretical (and contemporary European) use, it denotes someone committed to rights, free markets, limited government, and the rule of law so arguably the entire American political terrain. These differences aren't explained by homonymy, that is, by us having the same word for two entirely different things, such as "race" for a kind of contest and for a genetic grouping. They also aren't different conceptions of a single concept: if my conception of "justice" is fairness, I likely disagree with someone who understands justice to be "mutual advantage." I can endorse both conceptions of "liberal" as intelligible and acceptable uses in two related contexts. At the same time, both uses of liberal are closely related to politics, in the way another, now mainly obsolete use of "liberal" as someone who is free with money, is not. And we can tell a coherent story about the emergence of the two related meanings, likely having to do with American politics in the 1930s and 1040s.7

In popular nineteenth-century use, dignity frequently meant the kind of *positional* or *hierarchical* respectability it had meant for a long time and still means for us when we speak of "dignitaries": persons of high rank. But there was also significant variability in its use, suggesting that dignity could be both internal—you could feel it—and outward—others could ascribe it to you—and thereby inherently personal and not merely positional, depending on your place in a broader social context. In Henry Taylor's *The Statesman*, for example, dignity is in fact inherent: "A dignity which has to be contended for is not worth a quarrel; for it is of the essence of real dignity to be self-sustained, and

<sup>7</sup> I find John Gunnell's account a plausible one. John G. Gunnell, *Imagining the American Polity: Political Science and the Discourse of Democracy* (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004).

no man's dignity can be asserted without being impaired."8 The text is ironic—sarcastic, even—and the backdrop is clearly the practice in which people *do* insist on their dignity. By contrast, consider another example three decades later: in Anthony Trollope's 1870s masterpiece *The Way We Live Now*, the concept of dignity plays many roles. Here, "dignity" attaches to socially recognized honors and gender, with different conceptions of what counts as dignity depending on those social markers. Correspondingly, the demands of dignity vary with the context:

Mr. Melmotte on that morning had many visitors, among whom one of the earliest and most unfortunate was Mr. Longestaffe. At that time there had been arranged at the offices in Abchurch Lane a mode of double ingress and egress,—a front stairs and a back stairs approach and exit, as is always necessary with very great men,—in reference to which arrangement the honour and dignity attached to each is exactly contrary to that which generally prevails in the world; the front stairs being intended for everybody, and being both slow and uncertain, whereas the back stairs are quick and sure, and are used only for those who are favoured.9

At issue here is the uneasy relationship the old notables have with the new: aristocratic status gets you access to the new power—money which Mr. Melmotte represents, and which is supposed to be egalitarian and meritocratic. At the same time, because this is access to people the old notables should not be seen rubbing elbows with—Mr. Melmotte is a foreigner and might even be a Jew!—the access needs to be secret. Hence the back stairs.

<sup>9</sup> Anthony Trollope, *The Way We Live Now* (Empire Books, 2013), Kindle ed., chap. 53.

Dignity is also behavioral: "The father very slowly, and with much dignity of deportment, opened the drawer."10 It is positional and gendered. Fathers, in other words, have a dignity in relationship toward their children, especially daughters, which even the ineffectual Mr. Longestaffe, the father here, must try to maintain: "At a sudden burst he could stand upon his authority, and assume his position with parental dignity."11 And, finally, women have a particular dignity. For example, Hetta Carbury, one of the heroines of the novel, is unhappy at the dishonesty of Paul Montague, one of the (almost) heroes of the book:

It is hoped that the reader need hardly be informed that Hetta Carbury was a very miserable young woman as soon as she decided that duty compelled her to divide herself altogether from Paul Montague. I think that she was irrational; but to her it seemed that the offence against herself,—the offence against her own dignity as a woman,—was too great to be forgiven.12

From Hetta's perspective—whether correct or not—Paul has been untruthful about his actions and, specifically, has had a relationship with another woman. Now, to be cheated on was and still is a moral wrong, regardless of gender. That is, as a form of deceit, it is not only a textbook violation of the general duty of truthfulness, it also violates the respect and trust lovers or potential lovers should maintain toward one another, in particular. However, this moral violation of special duties of truthfulness is only part of what is going on in Hetta's case. There is also a gendered dimension of dignity in play. Women's *honor* is agentic and requires remaining chaste, but women's *dignity* is not agentic. It depends on the respectability of "their" men. That is

<sup>11</sup> Trollope, *The Way We Live Now*, chap. 21.

<sup>12</sup> Trollope, *The Way We Live Now*, chap. 84.

why Hetta is so angry. Her dignity is harmed by the actions of another agent, "her" man.

This ambiguity between gendered dignity and dignity is general is one of the first dimensions in the multivocality of dignity that begins to be used politically. This is well illustrated by that quintessential argument on gender inequality, Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Woman*.

## Fixing "False" Dignity

Unlike the Taylor play or the Trollope novel, which I selected as convenient examples of broader nineteenth-century uses of dignity, Mary Wollstonecraft's *Vindication of the Rights of Woman* is not a random example of the shifting discourse of dignity. Though written in the 1790s, it shapes much of the discussion that follows in the nineteenth century, not to mention its contemporaries. Written as a companion of sorts to her now lesser-known *Vindication of the Rights of Man*, it is Wollstonecraft's engagement with contemporary events and her contemporaries: the French Revolution, most urgently, but also Edmund Burke's rejection of the Revolution in what is now the founding statement of classical conservatism, *Reflections on the Revolution in France*, as well, most importantly, with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who was often seen as having helped bring about the French Revolution. In other words, Wollstonecraft takes on both the opponents of the Revolution and those who sympathized with it or whose views could be seen as sympathetic.13

For Wollstonecraft, dignity is one of the key concepts in this undertaking. She affirms the concept of dignity as valuable when she criticized Rousseau for implying that civilization is all a sham: "A curse it might be reckoned, if the whole of our existence were bounded by our

<sup>13</sup> Rousseau had died before the Revolution, so he can't be called a supporter, despite the arguments of the Revolution's opponents.

continuance in this world; for why should the gracious fountain of life give us passions, and the power of reflecting, only to imbitter our days and inspire us with mistaken notions of dignity?"14 Wollstonecraft does agree with Rousseau that civilization is, in many ways, in a sorry state and that existing positions of "supreme dignity" are in fact the result of "vile intrigues, unnatural crimes, and every vice that degrades our nature."15 Yet dignity *is* a meaningful concept. Her goal is not to eliminate it, or to throw "away the wheat with the chaff," which she says Rousseau did, but to get it right, especially with regard to gender:

I earnestly wish to point out in what true dignity and human happiness consists—I wish to persuade women to endeavour to acquire strength, both of mind and body, and to convince them that the soft phrases, susceptibility of heart, delicacy of sentiment, and refinement of taste, are almost synonimous with epithets of weakness, and that those beings who are only the objects of pity and that kind of love, which has been termed its sister, will soon become objects of contempt.16

There exists, in other words, "true" dignity, here glossed as strength of mind and body. This true dignity is not positional or role dependent. The "supreme dignity" that people acquire through the vile intrigues is one example of false dignity. "Women's dignity" is another. As she points out, the characteristics that are associated with feminine dignity are, on sober reflection, characteristics of weakness and thereby not grounds of respect-worthiness, but its opposite, contempt.

Importantly, though, true dignity is not inherent. Persons don't have it by virtue of their personhood; it is acquired. And, to use

<sup>14</sup> Mary Wollstonecraft, *A Vindication of the Rights of Woman* (Peterborough, ON: Broadview Press, 1997), 120.

<sup>15</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 122.

<sup>16</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 111.

Wollstonecraft's eighteenth-century term, it is therefore an acquirement: a product of cultivation. Although Wollstonecraft mentions the strength of both mind *and* body, the focus of her book is on the mind (as is true of much of the feminist advocacy that followed). The reason, too, is obvious: First, intellectual prowess is likely more important in effecting mobility through social hierarchies, especially in the context of Enlightenment rhetoric about the value of reason. Second, it is the denial of women's intellectual prowess that critics from Wollstonecraft onward seize on as the most persistent and damaging mode of oppression, however well intentioned:

Into this error men have, probably, been led by viewing education in a false light; not considering it as the first step to form a being advancing gradually towards perfection; but only as a preparation for life. On this sensual error, for I must call it so, has the false system of female manners been reared, which robs the whole sex of its dignity, and classes the brown and fair with the smiling flowers that only adorns the land.17

Finally, although there *are* physical differences between the sexes that might make a social or political difference, of course we know now and, I would argue, Wollstonecraft and her contemporaries knew then, however inchoately—there are no intellectual differences between the sexes. So although dignity is not inherent, the *potential* for it is. And even if there were people around who denied the universal potential, Wollstonecraft's argument for the potential is a first step in the universalization of the idea of dignity.

We see this logic throughout the nineteenth century, even if we don't see the specific concept of dignity used in the arguments. In the United States, for example, the Seneca Falls declaration in 1848 for women's

<sup>17</sup> Wollstonecraft, *Vindication*, 167.

suffrage turns on it. Women's right to vote has been denied because they aren't seen as competent for citizenship. The signatories of the declaration—Elizabeth Cady Stanton perhaps most prominent among them—argue they are. Or consider John Stuart and Harriet Taylor Mill's formulation of a similar argument, framed as one of the "experiments" John Stuart Mill had advocated in his *On Liberty*: we haven't yet tried the experiment of treating women on an equal footage, so let us try it now, the Mills argue in midcentury. In all such cases, the goal is to show that problematic conceptions of capacity and potential, whether of women or of some other undervalued group, are simply contingent and that all people do have the capacities and potential, if properly cultivated.

Put this way, dignity talk might reasonably disappear. Arguments purely for equality, or equality of opportunity, might suffice. And if dignity is, as Wollstonecraft's formulation suggests, an acquirement, equal respect would appropriately remain a form of appraisal respect, to be bestowed on those who deserve it. But, I suggest, there is another way of thinking about dignity. This other way will be the seed that helps establish the inherency of equal dignity. It is the argument about work.

## Dignity of Labor?

"Dignity of labor" refers to the idea that *all* work is respectable and therefore respect-worthy. The idea wasn't born in the nineteenth century; its roots are much earlier in Christian thought. Consider, for example, this stanza from George Herbert's "The Elixir" (1633):

> A servant with this clause Makes drudgery divine: Who sweeps a room as for Thy Laws, Makes that and th' action fine.18

<sup>18</sup> George Herbert, *The Temple* (Menston, Yorkshire: Scolar Press, 1968).

Here the dignity of the work arises from the disposition of the worker: imbuing the activity of work as reverence toward God gives work its value.

Older though the idea is, it isn't a coincidence that the nineteenth century sees the concept revived. Industrial Revolution, the emergence of the labor movement in many variants, and broader politics of equality made work not just a political, but also a conceptual, battleground. The politics are complicated, however. The least surprising position, embraced by some labor movements from the nineteenth century on, is the demand for respect for workers on the grounds of the inherent dignity of labor. *Any* work, and therefore any worker, deserves respect, and the treatment that goes with it, the argument goes.

Interestingly, some influential advocates of political equality for the working class reject this idea. For the most famous theorist of the working classes, the concept of dignity is not relevant: it doesn't play a role in Marx's political philosophy, and his main argument about the alienating effect of industrial work is a far cry from the dignity of labor. But more relevant for our purposes is the French socialist anarchist Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's argument because it arrives at a conclusion somewhat similar to Marx's, but by invoking dignity.

For Proudhon, the conditions of some work—modern, industrial, poorly paid work—not only lack dignity, but they deprive their practitioners of dignity. In his *System of Economical Contradictions, or the Philosophy of Misery* (1846), Proudhon says,

The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, says the Gospel, and the violent take it by force. These words are the allegory of society. In society regulated by labor, dignity, wealth, and glory are objects of competition; they are the reward of the strong, and competition may be defined as the regime of force.19

<sup>19</sup> Pierre Joseph Proudhon, *System of Economical Contradictions, or the Philosophy of Misery* (Cambridge: John Wilson and Son, 1888), available at http://socserv2.socsci.mcmaster.ca/~econ/ ugcm/3ll3/index.html, chap. 2.

Elsewhere in the same text, he makes it clear that the working classes do indeed appear *not* to be respect-worthy, but that their respectworthiness has little to do with work: The "eternal babble of the economists about the improvidence of laborers, their idleness, their want of dignity, their ignorance, their debauchery, their early marriages, etc." is a result of the oppressive conditions in which they find themselves, not for the lack of meaningful engagement. Education won't do the trick; the combination of labor and education, for Proudhon, is nothing other than a recipe for misery because it reveals to the worker the indignity of his condition. Perhaps most interestingly, the desire for luxury, so strenuously denied to the workers by prohibitive taxation and the paternalism of the ruling classes, may be one of the small chances at dignity the lower orders might have: "It is the taste for luxury which in our day, in the absence of religious principles, sustains the social movement and reveals to the lower classes their dignity."20

Proudhon's use of "dignity" is still ambiguous. Is he being ironic and sarcastic here? (He frequently is.) Is he using it in the superficial way that Taylor and Trollope occasionally do, referring to the outward appearance of respectability, as opposed to respect-worthiness? I suggest not. In fact, I suggest we read him as articulating a conception of dignity that is inherent and universal; for elsewhere he explicitly invokes the Kantian conception, whereby persons, by virtue of their personhood (and *not* by virtue of their role, action, or place in an institution) have dignity.21

To be clear, Proudhon's argument does not follow the logic I articulated above, namely, a conceptual inversion that succeeds at making something previously disrespected an object of respect. Indeed, that he did *not* use this logic is the reason Proudhon's argument had less

<sup>20</sup> Proudhon, *System of Economical Contradictions*. About a century later, George Orwell echoes this same sentiment when he castigates upper-class lefties for their contemptuous paternalism toward the poor: the desire for unhealthy luxuries may be one of the claims for human dignity the poor have. See George Orwell, *The Road to Wigan Pier* (San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1958), 99.

purchase among his contemporaries than, say, Marx's—though it is beyond this chapter to substantiate this point. That said, Proudhon's argument did help keep the question of the dignity of labor alive, albeit in a way he would have lamented. And here we arrive at a third complicated position about the dignity of labor.

It is a Christian, I want to suggest, who plays a key catalyzing role in universalizing the concept of the dignity of labor. Pope Leo XIII's influential papal encyclical *Rerum Novarum, or the Rights and Duties of Capital and Labor* (1891) enters directly into the nineteenth-century political conversation about the antagonism between classes. We might call Leo's position conciliatory; he condemns what the advocates of the working classes would call exploitation. The claim invokes dignity explicitly: "The following duties bind the wealthy owner and the employer: not to look upon their work people as their bondsmen, but to respect in every man his dignity as a person ennobled by Christian character."22 Here, dignity is no longer merely attached to work, but to personhood. But the political implications are not at all the same as for Proudhon. Considerations of dignity, in part, ground the right of state intervention into labor disputes. I quote Leo here at length:

If by a strike of workers or concerted interruption of work there should be imminent danger of disturbance to the public peace; or if circumstances were such as that among the working class the ties of family life were relaxed; if religion were found to suffer through the workers not having time and opportunity afforded them to practice its duties; if in workshops and factories there were danger to morals through the mixing of the sexes or from other harmful occasions of evil; or if employers laid burdens upon their workmen which were unjust, or degraded them with conditions repugnant to their dignity as human beings; finally, if health were endangered by excessive

<sup>22</sup> Leo XIII, "Leo XIII—Rerum Novarum," http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html.

labor, or by work unsuited to sex or age—in such cases, there can be no question but that, within certain limits, it would be right to invoke the aid and authority of the law.23

Again, workers have dignity "as human beings." And there are things that would violate that dignity: unjust burdens and other "repugnant conditions." The state, in short, is permitted to prevent those injustices and protect the dignity of the workers.

But workers are also bound in what they may do. Strikes are not a violation of employers'—or apparently anybody's—dignity, but they are socially disruptive and therefore also subject to state intervention. The message is a clear rejection of radical political advocacy. The implied message and, I want to suggest, the legacy of this way of thinking about dignity is that the inherent dignity of persons *limits* its political power. Dignity is what philosophers call a "side constraint": something that limits what may be done to persons but, *because it is already there, in everyone's personhood*, not a ground on which to demand a fundamental change of status.

## Conclusion

So far, I have considered the conceptual snapshots of gender and labor; one remains. There is one kind of status that is *tout court* inconsistent with inherent human dignity. This chapter began with the example of slavery, and Leo's language of bondsmen reminds us—and certainly it reminded his nineteenth-century contemporaries—of the relatively recent end of slavery. We might call the consequence of Leo XIII's treatment of dignity its depolicitization. The depoliticization of dignity may have limited the concept's usefulness for the politics of labor, but not for all politics. That the language of inherent dignity emerges in the century of abolition is not a coincidence.

<sup>23</sup> Leo XIII, "Leo XIII—Rerum Novarum."

Let us go back some decades from Leo XIII and consider one of the most powerful and eloquent critics of slavery, Frederick Douglass. Consider a passage from Douglass's autobiography. This is on his first visit to the North, and he is trying to make sense of the differences he observes between the slave-owning South and the North. On visiting New Bedford harbor, where he marvels at the wealth and the large ships, he writes:

Added to this, almost every body seemed to be at work, but noiselessly so, compared with what I had been accustomed to in Baltimore. There were no loud songs heard from those engaged in loading and unloading ships. I heard no deep oaths or horrid curses on the labourer. I saw no whipping of men; but all seemed to go smoothly on. Every man appeared to understand his work, and went at it with a sober yet cheerful earnestness, which betokened the deep interest which he felt in what he was doing, *as well as a sense of his own dignity as a man*. 24

Contrast this to his calling out white Americans' hypocrisy in the 1851 speech "What to the Slave is the 4th of July?": "You discourse eloquently on the dignity of labor; yet, you sustain a system which, in its very essence, casts a stigma upon labor."25 Sure, he suggests, there is dignity in labor *if the inherent dignity of the human being is respected*.

How do we get to 1948 from Douglass? I have suggested that he, like Wollstonecraft, Proudhon, and Leo, helps the world understand the concept in a new way. But why 1948? The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is, as I suggested earlier, a nonarbitrary but still not *the* key event in the universalization of dignity. I have not said anything

about the early decades of the twentieth century, during which the conception of inherent dignity slowly, or "secretly," spreads, even making its way to constitutions, such as Ireland's in the 1930s.26 So I might just walk away from the historical context of the Declaration with no remark about either the Holocaust or about the Cold War. But I want to end with an observation about the politics of the context.

It is certainly true that the Holocaust makes it possible for the Declaration to get the kind of support it does, but the Cold War grounds its content. What I might call the Catholic conception can serve as a convenient resource in the context of the Cold War. That conception affirms the dignity of humanity *and* labor while, at the same time, undercutting broader political claims about the exploitation of work—just the kinds of claims the Soviet bloc was making against the West. Understanding work as inherently dignified is a powerful counter to a moralized Marxist rhetoric, which sees wage labor by itself as a moral evil.

This chapter is not a piece of twentieth-century history, so I will not try to answer the historical question of whether such a tension about conceptions of labor existed around the framing of the Declaration. Real historians have already worked on it. But it is a feature of my chapter to admit that such a tension may indeed play a significant role in the framing. This has to do with the originally Christian depoliticization of the concept of dignity. The concept remains a moral one, but with less obvious political consequences after the end of slavery. In other words, it may be the depolicitization, as I have suggested, that makes the concept's occurrence appealing *and* palatable to the Cold War partisans.

The above is not a cynical conclusion. Cold War legacy notwithstanding, the universalization of dignity is far from meaningless, and the depoliticization in terms of labor is not a total depolicitization. How

do we know? Just think of political struggles that emerge at the time or shortly after the Declaration. Whether Indian independence from Britain or the US civil rights movement, the political arguments—in addition to always necessary political action—that ground the movements often implicitly and sometimes explicitly invoke the idea of universal human dignity.

# *Reflection*: Why Bioethics Isn't Ready for Human Dignity
*Marcus Düwell*

Discussions in bioethics were perhaps the main reason why human dignity was so intensely debated over the last years. Bioethicists debated when the life of a person we owe respect to starts (conception, nidation, birth); what the status is of human beings with limited, uncertain, or no rational capacities (coma, brain death, Alzheimer's); what kind of obligations we have toward human beings at the end of their life (end-of-life decisions, euthanasia, advanced directives); and whether the application of various new technologies (reproductive technologies, cloning, enhancement) would lead to a reduction of human beings to mere means. And in all these debates, the concept human dignity has featured prominently. One reason for this difficulty may be that various groups tried to monopolize the use of this concept. Christian religious groups, for example, coined the concept of "dignity" as their heritage, often by intermingling it with the idea of "sanctity of life."1 Or consider that in debates about cloning or euthanasia, human dignity seemed to

<sup>1</sup> See, e.g., L. R. Kass, *Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics* (San Francisco: Encounter Books, 2002).

signify a general religious taboo that could even restrict the exercise of basic rights. Case in point, some got the impression that a kind of "Dignitarian Alliance"—a variety of scholars and public intellectuals holding a wide array of religious and communitarian views—used the notion of "human dignity" in a way that could undermine the normative basis of the human rights framework *in general*. 2 Liberals on the other hand tried to outweigh concerns about legalization or toleration of euthanasia by emphasizing the importance of "dying with dignity," or they downplayed risks of biotechnologies by emphasizing that it is appropriate for human beings to act autonomously and with curiosity. In short, it is fair to say that "human dignity" became the focal point that rendered the ideological and religious signature of bioethical debates visible—that is, to the public.

On a philosophically more interesting level, however, it seems that bioethicists of all persuasions have some difficulties in understanding how the idea of human dignity as the foundational concept of the human rights framework would relate to the methodologies and concepts they are accustomed to. In the following I will reconstruct and critically discuss some dominant understandings of human dignity in bioethics, roughly following the chronology of bioethical debates.

## Instrumentalizing Human Beings

As part of the Nuremberg Trials German doctors who had conducted human experiments in Nazi concentration camps were prosecuted (sometimes called the "Doctor's Trial"). In this context, the term "human dignity" was used only incidentally, but "crimes

<sup>2</sup> D. Beyleveld and R. Brownsword, *Consent in the Law* (Oxford: Hart, 2007), 9–48.

against humanity" were extensively discussed and condemned as the *absolute barrier* to signify the morally intolerable within the realm of "medicine." At the same time the extreme case of human experiments by Nazi doctors was a reason to reconsider the standards of appropriate behavior in medicine in general. By doing so, the trial formed an important step in the direction of a change from the paternalistic Hippocratic paradigm of medical ethics toward a normative framework that would see human dignity as the requirement to respect the *authority of the patient to decide* the treatment she is undergoing ("free and informed consent"). The atrocities of the Nazis were as well the context in which the German constitution referred to human dignity. The function of human dignity in the German discussion is a complicated one, because the formulation of the constitution suggests that the commitment to human dignity is the justification of the entire basic rights and the normative order of the state. At the same time, one sees the dominant interpretation human dignity as condemning the use of human beings as "mere objects"3—an implicit reference to Kant is present here, but at the same time the whole context of the Holocaust.

Thus, we find in these early debates two elements regarding human dignity: the prohibition of an instrumentalization of human beings and the idea that the patient has to authorize the action of physicians in general.4 And yet in recent debates bioethicists and lawyers often reduce human dignity to only the first aspect, as the interpretation of the German constitutions shows. But if we would follow this understanding, human dignity could hardly be the foundation of the entire human rights framework. One can imagine a legal order that condemns

<sup>3</sup> G. Dürig, "Der Grundrechtssatz von der Menschenwürde," *Archiv des offentlichen Rechts* 81 (1956): 117–56.

<sup>4</sup> Beyleveld and Brownsword, *Consent in the Law*.

atrocities as extreme as the Holocaust but that knows only limited protection of civil and human rights, certainly when it comes to social, cultural, and economic rights. Respect for human dignity is more than prohibition of instrumentalization. If, for example, a patient does not have access to life-saving medical technology, not providing it to her certainly does not amount to using her as an instrument, since the patient is not used at all. But it is another question whether the person's dignity is respected, that we treat him or her as an end in itself, as someone that deserves to live in a political and legal order that allows her to live a life of her own. More plausible for identifying human dignity with a prohibition of instrumentalization would be the understanding that instrumentalization of human beings is immoral *because* we have to respect the authority of humans about their own life, and, accordingly, this respect should govern our praxis in general.

## Contested Moral Status

In the course of the development of bioethics since the 1970s, human dignity has played a regular role in debates focused on the beginning and end of human life, and, in turn, questions like these: What feature makes it true that we owe respect to human beings? Why do we owe this respect to humans under conditions of brain death or coma? Why should we see human beings during the earliest phases of their life as beings that have dignity? These discussions were motivated by technological developments (e.g., the possibility of artificial insemination) but quite soon resulted in fundamental questions about *whom* we owe moral respect to, including the question whether it is morally required or condemnable to treat human beings differently than animals. This also raised questions about our reasons for ascribing moral status to any kind of creature, such as whether the *potential* to develop into a human person would suffice as a reason for ascribing such a status.

However, disputants in this debate often do not distinguish clearly between the concepts "moral status" and "human dignity," which is problematic because if a specific approach, like some utilitarian ones, does not allow for the concept of 'respect for the dignity of the human being' in the first place—that is, for respecting persons in themselves independently of any consideration of their utility the question of the dignity of an embryo cannot arise. The debate is important for an understanding of human dignity because it forces us to answer some central questions clearly: Why do we owe special respect to human beings? What features of human beings are relevant for this respect? What if some human beings don't have those features, only to a limited degree, not yet, not anymore, or will never have?

These considerations help explain why in bioethics it has been contested that "humanity" can be a reason to justify respect for all human beings. Thus while some see the last taboo as broken when any being that belongs to the "human family" is excluded from the protection of human dignity, others see reference to the membership of the human species as "speciesism"—a morally dubious discrimination because a mere biological criterion is inappropriate to justify morally different treatments;5 the concept "human dignity" takes pride of place in those disputes. For the applicability of a concept of human dignity in all these contexts it is important to distinguish various forms of reference to the "human species." When human dignity is criticized as being "speciesistic," it is assumed that "being a member of the human species" is used as a *reason why* we owe respect to human beings. Only when referring to the biological species in such a *justificatory* sense can we speak about a morally unjustified discrimination. In the long history of "human dignity," however, the required respect

<sup>5</sup> Peter Singer, *Practical Ethics* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2011).

is not justified by biological features but by reference to other features, like the rational nature of human beings, their capacity for action, their status as image of God, and so on. But it is something completely different if we are refereeing to species membership not as a justificatory reason but a pragmatic *criterion* for purposes of identification. Such a criterion may be important in various contexts; for example, it may be difficult or even impossible to judge to what extent a particular member of a species does or does not have some rational capacities, and we therefore extend the dignity status to all members of the species in question. Granted, other arguments against using "species membership" as a pragmatic criterion might be possible, but the criticism of speciesism is not valid.6 In any case, bioethics has to reconsider what weight making reference to the human species has when ascribing dignity, if any.

## Dignity of the Species?

References to the human species played a different role in the last two decades, when possible biotechnological modifications of the human species—as opposed to individuals only—found its way onto the agenda. Debates about *enhancement* focused on technologies whose application could either enhance features that are significant for human beings in general, or would have effects that go significantly beyond the scope of the individual human being—where some even affect the species as such. Genetic preimplantation diagnosis allows for selection of specific features of the preimplantation embryo; cloning would allow for duplicating the genetic structure of an individual human being; and there are other technologies in the pipeline that could enhance human

<sup>6</sup> Marcus Düwell, *Methods, Theories, Domains* (New York: Routledge, 2012), 109–24.

characteristics more dramatically, including the possibility of introducing genetic material of animals into humans. In this milieu, it has been claimed that the dignity of human beings obliges us to do our best to enhance the human living condition, including the genetic makeup of the human being, and to try to transcend the biological limitations of the human species, and, in turn, to come to a "posthuman dignity."7 Others introduce the idea of a "dignity of the species" in a way that would require us to refrain from using such technologies, especially those whose application would allow us to decide about the genetic makeup of the offspring.8 Such an application would be unacceptable, such dissenters argue, because it would introduce a form of irreversible dependency in the relationship between the generations that undermines the possibilities of a society where individuals would have to recognize each other as equals, a central element of a society based on human dignity. The science-fiction-like nature of those debates should not allow us ignore the fact that these debates have a strong tendency to move the subject of human dignity from the individual to the collective level. This forces us to develop an understanding of how respect for an individual, which human dignity traditionally is claimed to require, relates to obligations toward the species as such.

## Bioethics' Problem with Dignity

Other topics could have been mentioned here, such as whether or not respect for human dignity requires us to refrain from the commodification of human tissues, or whether or not it requires us to assist people in their wish to end their life in cases of terminal illness. But it seems more important to get an understanding of *why*

<sup>8</sup> Jürgen Habermas, *The Future of Human Nature*, trans. W. Beister (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2003).

bioethicists have such a problem navigating the question of human dignity in all those debates. Why is bioethics not well prepared to understand human dignity? Most bioethical texts do not have a clear idea what kind of concept they should treat human dignity *as—*as a rule? A right? A principle? An absolute barrier against extreme atrocities? Or as the foundational concept of the human rights framework?9 This lack of clarity is all the more pressing given that the entire international regulatory system of the life sciences is part of the human rights framework. Bioethicists have insufficiently reflected on their relationship to this framework which may be one of the reasons why some scholars have seen fit to call it an unclear or even "useless concept."10 But perhaps they are noting not a shortcoming of the concept of human dignity, but rather a shortcoming of the methodological tools of bioethicists, which tools may not be appropriate for reaching an understanding of the complexity of those debates. The mainstream in bioethics as "principlism" works with normative concepts such as "midlevel principles,"11 which treat the normative reference points of bioethical debates as principles (like beneficence or autonomy) that divergent ethical positions are assumed to agree on. Bioethical debates according to those approaches have the task merely of specifying the normative content of those mid-level principles with regard to concrete moral questions, and then of weighing the principles against each other. If this is the model of a "principle," the role of human dignity must be unclear. But if human dignity is the foundational concept of the human rights framework, it

<sup>11</sup> T. L. Beauchamp and J. F. Childress, *Principles of Biomedical Ethics* (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012).

must be another type of normative concept than, for example, the right to informed consent. Most bioethicists treat "principles" as a one-dimensional concept. There is a variety of principles that are relevant for specific contexts or practices but whose systematic relationship is hardly clarified. Human dignity doesn't make that much sense when treated as a mid-level principle. We can, however, see human dignity as a principle that reflects on the specificity of human beings and explains why each human being has the status of a rights holder that deserves respect as an individual. But if *each* human being deserves such a respect, the right to be protected cannot just be protected on the level of the individual, and therefore we have necessarily to deal in social and political terms. It is the societal conditions that determine to what extent we are able to enjoy the content of human rights; Gewirth has coined the term "generic rights" for rights to the conditions of exercising rights, which are presupposed by all other rights.12 Questions about human dignity in the context of biotechnology are increasingly dealing with the design of a society and the global world and the question to what extent human beings still have the possibility of living a life wherein they are respected in their authority to govern central aspects of this life, wherein they can decide about access to their own genetic data, and wherein they have access to basic medical treatment and can live under stable and secure ecological conditions.

Only if we understand that in the concept of human dignity questions about the role of humanity, the rights of individuals, and the structure of our normative social and political orders are interconnected, will fruitful debates about human dignity be possible. Instead of bashing "human dignity" as vague and useless,

<sup>12</sup> Alan Gewirth, *Reason and Morality* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1978).

bioethicists could start to ask self-critically whether they are sufficiently prepared to deal with such a concept. But if bioethicists want to give normative orientation in questions of life and death, they are confronted with the question that*—*according to Kant*—*is the most fundamental question: What is it to be a human being? In that sense, human dignity is not a useless but a necessary and unavoidable concept.

# Chapter 11: Sympathy and Dignity in Early Africana Philosophy
*Bernard Boxill*

Sympathy's vital importance in human affairs is perhaps the major theme of *The Souls of Black Folk*, W. E. B. Du Bois's great collection of essays first published in 1903. Throughout the collection, Du Bois lamented the want of sympathy between people and their consequent failure to recognize their equal humanity in each other. Indeed, at one point he contended that this failure, not poverty, or wickedness, or ignorance, was the "tragedy of the age."1 More positively, citing events in the nineteenth century for support, he suggested that an enhanced sympathy flourishing between more and more people would help lead to urgently needed social reforms, especially those related to the treatment of blacks in America.2 And in "Of Alexander Crummell,"

<sup>1</sup> See W. E. B. Du Bois, *The Souls of Black Folk*, ed. Henry Louis GatesJr. and Terri Hume Oliver (New York: Norton, 1999), 141–42.

<sup>2</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 136.

the twelfth essay in the collection, he crafted his "tale" of Alexander Crummell's life specifically to enhance the sympathy of his white readers for Crummell—the tacit suggestion being that sympathizing with Crummell would move them to *respect* Crummell and in turn, presumably, other black people. Du Bois seemed confident that he had succeeded in this project, exulting near the end of his tale that he had swept aside the "Veil" that kept the races apart, finally enabling white people to see the "mighty inspiration" in Crummell.3

In fact Du Bois failed in this primary project to create a transformative tale for his white readers. However, he succeeded in a second, unstated project, namely, to enhance sympathy for Crummell in his *black* readers. Moreover, and crucially, through that sympathy, Du Bois helped his black readers to prevail in their struggles, including the struggle to achieve dignity. Since this project was practical rather than theoretical, Du Bois refrained from presenting an analysis of dignity with argument and counterargument, relying instead on relating incidents in Crummell's life that would show him experiencing sentiments that would infuse sympathy into his black readers and lead them to dignity. Thus he showed Crummell fighting losing battles against the forces bent on frustrating his efforts to lead his people out of bondage; tempted sorely by hate, despair, and doubt; driven into wandering the world in search of knowledge of himself; and finally after twenty years returning home from Africa triumphant over his temptations. Crummell had sought knowledge of himself and had found it, discovering that it was knowledge of his duties. And that knowledge and his journey to it had given him a dignity that Du Bois immediately recognized and acknowledged on their first meeting, "instinctively" bowing before him, thus ratifying his dignity with the gesture that "dignity commands," as the philosopher Aurel Kolnai once said.4

I will spend some time on the idea of an enhanced sympathy since it is crucial to understanding the fates of Du Bois's two projects. In the first section, I present Du Bois's account of an enhanced sympathy, which I call "Du Boisian sympathy," as a special case of David Hume's account of sympathy. In the second section, I use Frederick Douglass's discussion of the reformative possibilities of slave singing to emphasize the difficulties of achieving Du Boisian sympathy. In the third section, I explain why Du Bois's first project was probably unsuccessful, though his second project fared better. And in the fourth and final section, I suggest what I think we can learn about Du Bois's conception of dignity from the sentiments that an enhanced sympathy would transfuse into his black readers from his tale of Crummell's life.

## Sympathy

"The nineteenth century," Du Bois wrote, "was the first century of human sympathy,—the age when half wonderingly we began to descry in others that transfigured spark of divinity that we call Myself; when clodhoppers and peasants, and tramps and thieves, and millionaires and—sometimes—Negroes, became throbbing souls, whose warm pulsing life touched us so nearly that we half gasped with surprise, crying, 'Thou too! Hast Thou seen Sorrow and the dull waters of Hopelessness? Hast Thou known Life?' And then all helplessly we peered into these Other-worlds, and wailed, 'O World of Worlds, how shall man make you one?'"5

What exactly is "sympathy," for Du Bois? He never offers an explicit explanation; indeed the foregoing passage is the longest single statement he makes. So some reconstruction is in order. Obviously, Du Bois understands sympathy to be mostly, or at least most importantly, about the transmission of sorrow and its associated sentiments like

<sup>5</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 136.

disappointment, hopelessness, and a sense of helplessness and alienation. Du Bois was deeply impressed by the reformative power of these sentiments. Sorrow, especially the sorrow of the slaves, is foregrounded throughout *The Souls of Black Folk*, a fact made particularly plain by the bars and verses of the "sorrow songs" (slave songs) that Du Bois placed at the start each chapter. More to the point, the yearning for "oneness" that Du Bois expresses in the passage above suggests his agreement with Rousseau's claim that "we are attracted to our fellows less by the sentiments of our pleasures than by the sentiments of our pains, for we see far better in the latter the identity of our natures with theirs."6

And yet Du Boisian sympathy is not Rousseau's pity. For Rousseau, the pitier enjoys both the pity he has for the ills of those he pities, and the happiness that exempts him from those ills.7 Rousseau therefore described pity as "sweet" since the pitier is always exempt—at least for the period that he pities—from the ills of those he pities. Du Bois could not similarly describe sympathy as sweet. The people who share it always feel sorrow for the same ill—namely, of never being exempt from *any* ill. On Du Bois's account of sympathy, if people reflect deeply on the common condition they are in, they will see that it can be ameliorated only if they come together as one; that is, if they acknowledge their equal humanity and cooperate with each other on equal terms. Consequently, although Du Boisian sympathy and Rousseauian pity are both designed to be reformative, they evidently work in different ways.

In the long passage quoted above, Du Bois did not mean of course that sympathy started in the nineteenth century. His claim that "the nineteenth century was the first century of human sympathy" was followed immediately by the claim that only in the nineteenth century did "we" begin to descry ourselves in "others," whom he then

<sup>6</sup> Rousseau, *Emile; or On Education*, trans. Allan Bloom (New York: Basic Books, 1979), 221.

<sup>7</sup> See Rousseau, *Emile*, 229.

immediately identified as "clodhoppers and peasants, and tramps and thieves, and millionaires and—sometimes—Negroes." If his "we" in the claim refers to the majority of people in America and Britain ordinary middle-class white people—his point seems to have been that, although sympathy transmitted sorrow *among* middle-class whites before the nineteenth century, in that century it began to transmit *to* whites a new sorrow, namely, of clodhoppers, peasants, tramps, thieves, millionaires, and sometimes Negroes. Du Boisian sympathy is therefore a special kind of "widened" or "enhanced" sympathy, in the sense that it transmits sorrow among more people than it had before. We may understand it as a special case of Humean sympathy. I summarize Hume's account as follows: (1) The contents of our minds are divided into ideas and impressions, where impressions are the livelier, psychologically more forceful versions of ideas, and, importantly, include the passions; (2) there are cases where someone says or does something that "signals" to us that she is experiencing a certain passion; (3) in these cases, we form an idea of that passion; (4) that is because the impression we have of ourselves—literally, the lively feeling or sense of *self* that is in the background of our consciousness—transmits some of its vivacity *into* the very idea we formed of her passion; (5) by this transmission our idea of her passion *becomes* an impression of her passion—that is, it becomes a passion itself; (6) consequently, we feel her passion; (7) finally, this whole process is greatly enhanced by any resemblances we observe between ourselves and the person who is the object of our sympathy.8 This last step is crucial to explaining how sympathy can be widened to become Du Boisian sympathy.

So consider further Hume's claim that when "there is any peculiar similarity in our manners, or character, or country, or language, it facilitates the sympathy."9 Hume reasoned that, if the resemblance

<sup>8</sup> Hume delivers his basic account of sympathy in *Treatise*, 2.1.11. David Hume, *A Treatise of Human Nature*, ed. David Fate Norton and Mary J. Norton (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000).

<sup>9</sup> Hume, *Treatise*, 2.1.11, 207.

of our natures—ours and whoever is the object of our sympathetic attention—helps our impression of self transmit its vivacity into our idea of the other person's passion, then it will more easily transmit its vivacity to that idea *whenever* the "general resemblance of our natures" is strengthened. But then it also seems to follow that we can deliberately widen people's sympathy by deliberately increasing their resemblance to one another. Alternatively, since it is recognized resemblances that support and sustain sympathy, it must be possible to deliberately *remove* factors that have been distracting people's attention from any resemblances they have to each other.

Working a century after Hume, the black nationalist Martin Delany appealed to Hume's view of the importance of resemblance for the operation of sympathy in order to explain why slaves in the Americas were overwhelmingly black. Focusing on the differences in skin color and character of hair between Europeans and Africans, and noting that such differences were "as strongly marked in the colored people as in the Indians," he argued that, as in the case of the Indians, those differences made Africans "foreign to the sympathies of the invaders of the continent" and in turn helped to account for their selection as slaves.10 More generally, Delany claimed that those who proscribe others "select as the objects of their proscription, those who differed as much as possible, in some particulars, from themselves. This is to ensure the greater success, because it engenders the greater prejudice, or in other words, elicits less interest on the part of the oppressing class, in their favor."11 Delany was not suggesting that hatred of the color black motivated white people to enslave black people, or ignoring the economic motives for slavery. His point was that, given that white people were motivated to enslave other people for profit, they would enslave people who least

<sup>10</sup> Martin Robison Delany, *The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States, and Official Report of the Niger Valley Exploring Party*, ed. Toyin Falola (New York: Humanity Books, 2004), 50.

<sup>11</sup> Delany, *Condition, Elevation*, 48.

resembled them because, in accordance with Hume's view, sympathy would be less likely to make them share the sorrows of their slaves.

But widened Humean sympathy still falls short of Du Boisian sympathy. Surprise evidently always accompanies Du Boisian sympathy, but surprise need not accompany widened Humean sympathy unless, absurdly, people signaling sorrow also always signal surprise. So something further is needed to make sense of Du Bois's argument. Hume's compatriot Adam Smith tells us surprise is the emotion we feel from the unexpectedness of feeling another emotion.12 So perhaps surprise accompanies Du Boisian sympathy because a widened sympathy carries the passions of people whose passions were not expected. But if people ceaselessly receive sentiments from each other via sympathy, then it seems unlikely that the *mere receipt* of sentiments from people, even if for the first time, would occasion surprise. Nor will the mere receipt of any *particular* sentiment, which a widened sympathy transmits, be unexpected. Everyone knows *that* everyone else feels sorrow, joy, anguish, happiness, fear, and so on. As Hume remarked, "We never remark any passion or principle in others, of which, in some degree or other, we may not find a resemblance in ourselves."13 In short, in order to understand why surprise always follows Du Boisian sympathy, we will need to revise a few basics of Humean sympathy.

Hume says that we form an idea of the passion signaled. But surely sometimes the idea we form of the signaled passion is not an idea of the passion that was signaled, if only because convention and social learning play influential roles in determining the meaning of emotional gestures. A smile may thus be misconstrued as a threat because we know that people have learned how to smile at people that they hate. Or a kiss blown to signal contempt may be misconstrued as expressing love because the conventions we assumed to be necessary for a blown kiss to

<sup>12</sup> See Adam Smith, *The Essential Adam Smith*, ed. Robert L. Heilbroner (New York: Norton, 1986), 23.

<sup>13</sup> Hume, *Treatise*, 207.

express contempt were not followed. Alternatively, even if conventions for contemptible kiss-blowing were followed, we might still form an idea of love because we *wanted* to think that the blown kiss expressed love. Our own psychological set, especially our desires, thus also greatly affects the ideas that emotional signals convey to us.

Adam Smith pressed yet a further challenge. Smith allowed that what Hume described and called "sympathy" was possible, for example, that "grief and joy strongly expressed" might "at once affect the spectator with some degree of a like painful or agreeable emotion," but cautioned that the spectator's version of the other's emotion would be "extremely imperfect" until she knew its cause, meaning by "cause" the object of the emotion, that is, what it was directed at.14 If we take "imperfect" in an ordinary sense, it follows, if Smith is right, that the idea Hume says is formed when a passion is signaled is almost always not an idea of the passion that was signaled. An example may help clarify Smith's meaning. We see someone frowning and immediately form an idea of anger. But that idea is a very imperfect idea of the person's anger because we do not know what she is angry at. Consequently we make it less imperfect when we get to know the object of her anger. The implication is that the idea of anger formed in the process of Humean sympathy is anger without its object and is an extremely imperfect idea of anger with its object. Anger with its object, anger at something, is the passion that the person who signals her passion is feeling. If we form only an idea of anger without any object, we are forming an imperfect idea of her passion. If our idea is enlivened so that we come to experience the emotion it corresponds to, we are experiencing a passion that is an imperfect version of the passion that was signaled. For brevity let us call the emotion without its object the emotion simpliciter.

Hume's description of sympathy as proceeding very quickly suggests that the signs of emotion used to signal emotions typically do

<sup>14</sup> Adam Smith, *The Theory of Moral Sentiments*, ed. D. D. Raphael and A. L. Mackie (Indianapolis: Liberty Press, 1976), 11.

not indicate the objects of the passions they signal, so that the ideas we typically form of those passions will be ideas of passions simpliciter, not ideas of passions with their objects, which are the passions that the signaler of the passions experienced. If so, as our ideas are enlivened into passions, we come to experience only imperfect versions of the passions that the signaler experienced. When the sympathies of the middle-class white people in Du Bois's example were widened, they formed ideas of the fears, angers, and sorrows, all simpliciter, of the clodhoppers, and therefore came to experience these passions, only simpliciter. Since they were thoroughly familiar with such passions simpliciter, they experienced no surprise, and their widened sympathy was not Du Boisian sympathy.

What does the object of anger add to anger simpliciter? The cognitive theory of emotion suggests that emotions are constituted at least in part by sets of judgments, including evaluative judgments (other constituents may include desire, physical feelings, etc.). The theory further claims that particular emotions require particular kinds of judgments. For example, the judgment that harm is probable, even if not certain, is necessary to generate fear simpliciter. However, and crucially, fear of a definite object will also contain a large number of further judgments about the object of the fear, and these judgments will often differ radically from each other. In short, instances of the same general emotion may differ radically in virtue of differences in the number and complexity of the judgments that help to constitute them.

The upshot is that Humean sympathy can't transfer the robust, nonsimpliciter passions. Not readily anyway. Possibly if there were a specific sign for every particular instance of every emotion, Humean sympathy could proceed as quickly as Hume suggested, and the ideas formed of signaled emotions would be ideas of the emotions as the signalers experienced them—that is, in their robust forms, as opposed to merely ideas of the emotions simpliciter. But that possibility could never be realized. Our capacity to keep generating judgments of increasing complexity about the objects of our passions as our circumstances and beliefs expand or change, guarantees that different instances of the same emotion will differ drastically, even in the same person.

Hume's suggestion that we are more or less familiar with all human emotions is therefore right in one sense and wrong in another. We are more or less familiar with the emotions Humean sympathy transmits; but these are only passions simpliciter. We are not familiar with all emotions with their objects and consequently with all the judgments that help constitute them. The distinction enables us to account for the surprise that accompanies Du Boisian sympathy. Humean sympathy may not surprise us because it transmits passions simpliciter, and we are familiar with all or most such passions. But Du Boisian sympathy will surprise us because it transmits passions with all their objects and judgments and we cannot be familiar with all these objects or with the judgments that help constitute the passions. For example, the ordinary middle-class white people in Du Bois's example may have been surprised when they encountered the sophisticated and complex judgments that they found in the sorrows of clodhoppers because they had assumed that clodhoppers were too stupid to make such judgments. As Rousseau put it, "The rich are consoled about the ill they do to the poor, because they assume the latter to be stupid enough to feel nothing of it."15 If Humean sympathy did not have to be deliberately enhanced into Du Boisian sympathy, the rich could never maintain such assumptions. Thomas Jefferson could maintain his belief that the love of his black slaves for one another was "more an ardent desire" than "a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation,"16 because Humean sympathy transmitted to him only the love simpliciter of his slaves.

<sup>15</sup> Rousseau, *Emile*, 225.

<sup>16</sup> Thomas Jefferson, *Notes on the State of Virginia*, ed. William Peden (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1982), 159.

How do we make a widened Humean sympathy transmitting passions simpliciter into a Du Boisian sympathy transmitting passions with their objects? The answer may seem easy: identify the objects of the passions simpliciter that Humean sympathy transmitted into us. According to Smith we do so by spontaneously putting ourselves in the place of the person who expressed or signaled the emotion, and as a result we come to form some idea of the *object* of her emotion and therefore come to imagine feeling an emotion that is a more perfect version of her emotion than the passion simpliciter that we first felt. Alas, this process will often not get us Du Boisian sympathy. Consider Smith's example: "We blush for the impudence of another, though he himself appears to have no sense of the impropriety of his own behavior; because we cannot help feeling with what confusion we ourselves should be covered, had we behaved in so absurd a manner."17 In other words when someone behaves impudently and we spontaneously put ourselves in his place, instead of getting a fuller view or experience of *his* passion, we get instead a view of how *we* would feel if we had behaved as he did. This is not Du Boisian sympathy. Du Boisian sympathy wants to get deeper into the *agent's* passion by giving us a fuller account of the judgments that help to constitute it; Smith's proposal does not do that. Instead it gets us deeper into a different passion—the *spectator's*. She identifies the object of the agent's passion and makes judgments about it, using her own reason and background beliefs, and since these judgments will be different from the agent's, and help to constitute her passion, her passion will be different from the agent's. Smith also writes as if he believes that spectator will correctly identify the object of the agent's passion by putting herself in his place; in his example the agent is proud of his behavior, and the spectator is shamed by that same behavior. But since the spectator relies on her own experience, it may happen that what she thinks is the object of the agent's passion is not the object of his passion at all. He may fear a rabid dog,

<sup>17</sup> Smith, *Theory of Moral Sentiments*, 12.

but she may suppose that he fears a puppy. Although Smith was not trying to explain the genesis of moral approval and disapproval, his account of how we react to the imperfections of Humean sympathy emphasizes the difficulty of achieving a Du Boisian sympathy, and even intimates that nature works against our achieving it.

Du Bois's declaration, "All art is propaganda and ever must be, despite the wailing of the purists. I stand in utter shamelessness and say that whatever art I have for writing has been used always for propaganda, for gaining the right of black folk to love and enjoy. I do not care a damn for any art that is not used for propaganda," suggests that he thought that art could make Du Boisian sympathy possible.18 Perhaps he was inspired by Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel *Uncle Tom's Cabin*, popularly credited with helping to doom slavery. The novel is indeed a plausible means to Du Boisian sympathy. It gives the novelist the space she needs not only to describe her characters' passions simpliciter but to describe them together with their objects; if she describes her characters to resemble her readers, the vivacity of their conceptions of themselves could change their ideas of her characters' emotions into those very emotions, and they would have a Du Boisian sympathy for her characters.

But blacks especially objected that Stowe missed crucial details in her accounts of the slaves' sorrow. Martin Delany, for example, complained that although she portrayed "some of the suffering" of the slaves she really had no "sympathy" for them, and that her "sneers" at "independent" Haiti and esteem for the "dependent" colony in Liberia betrayed her failure to perceive that the slaves sorrowed most deeply for the loss of their independence and freedom.19

Stowe's failure may represent a general tendency. Frederick Douglass relates that the melancholy of the slaves singing matched that of

<sup>18</sup> Du Bois, "Criteria of Negro Art," in *W. E. B. DuBois: A Reader*, ed. David Levering Lewis (New York: Henry Holt, 1995), 511, 513, 514.

<sup>19</sup> Martin Delany, letter to Frederick Douglass in *Martin Delany: A Documentary Reader*, ed. Robert S. Levine (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 232.

the wailing of the starving Irish in the famine of 1845–1846.20 But although the melancholy of the dirge singers regularly reduced people to tears—they were hired to sing at wakes—those tears were not for the sorrow of either black slaves or the victims of famine. Similarly, according to Rousseau, Alexander of Pherae "dared not attend the performance of a single tragedy for fear that he might be seen to moan with Andromache and Priam," but "listened without emotion to the cries of so many citizens daily being murdered on his orders."21

Considerations like these might have suggested to Du Bois that he could make Humean sympathy into Du Boisian sympathy, and art into propaganda, if he accurately described the sorrows of real people, and used *beauty* in the expression of emotion to enliven his readers' ideas of these sorrows into real sorrows. In fact Du Bois claimed that he had always sought "to set the world right" with "beauty";22 and suggested that the beauty of the sorrow songs, as rendered by the Fisk Jubilee Singers, had facilitated the transmission of the slaves' "message" to the world.23 Alas, beauty in the expression of an emotion may attract attention to itself and away from the emotion and thus impede rather than facilitate the emotion's transmission. Perhaps the Fisk Singers earned money for Fisk because people paid to enjoy the beauty of their singing while ignoring the sentiments that their songs expressed.

## *Douglass on Du Boisian Sympathy*

Douglass agreed with Du Bois that the sorrow songs could be powerful means of reform. The "mere hearing of these songs," he claimed, "would do more to impress truly spiritual minded men and women of the soul-crushing and death-dealing characters of slavery, than

the reading of whole volumes of its mere physical cruelties."24 But he pointedly refrained from claiming any beauty for the sorrow songs, describing them instead as "rude," "wild," and "apparently incoherent."25 To be clear, Douglass was not referring to the same thing as Du Bois. Du Bois was referring to the sorrow songs as they were sung by trained singers mainly for white audiences—and sung to be beautiful to attract such audiences. Douglass was referring to the sorrow songs as they were sung by slaves. Still his discussion suggests how and why expressions of sentiments do not have to be beautiful to be reformative.

Douglass's comments suggest three points. First, like Delany, Douglass clearly agreed that white observers who write their "volumes" on slavery's "mere physical cruelties" miss the more elusive though ultimately more important misery that slavery causes by the theft of slaves' liberty. Second, his comments suggest that the slaves expressed and revealed that misery in their singing. And third, he proposes that only the "spiritual minded" would understand that misery. However, Douglass added a crucial fourth point. He claimed that such a "spiritual minded" person must "place himself in the deep, pine woods."26 In other words, slaves must not know that anyone is listening to their singing with an eye to understanding—through that singing—how or what they (the slaves) are thinking and feeling.

In his novelette *The Heroic Slave* Douglass repeated these points and added a fifth. In the story, a gentleman (significantly named Listwell), who "had long desired to sound the mysterious depths of the thoughts and feelings of a slave," becomes an abolitionist after overhearing a slave, Madison Washington, earnestly debating aloud with himself about what he ought to do given his circumstances.27 Crucially,

<sup>26</sup> Douglass, *My Bondage and My Freedom*, 66.

<sup>27</sup> Frederick Douglass, *The Oxford Frederick Douglass Reader*, ed. William L. Andrews (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 135. The name Listwell is significant because it emphasizes that a person who achieves Du Boisian sympathy must *listen* well; not hasten to put himself in the other's place.

Washington is completely unaware that anyone is listening. Indeed, he is in the woods when Listwell hears him. The fifth point thus seems to be that listening to slaves singing is, or at least can be like, listening to a person debating aloud with himself about what he ought to do.

How can such singing be anything like Washington's rational discourse? After all, Washington was considering various reasons for and against ends he could pursue, evidently hoping that he would thereby arrive at a decision about what he ought to do. By contrast, as already noted, in the slaves' singing we simply hear "rude," "wild," and "apparently incoherent songs."

The answer, it seems, is that in both cases—Washington talking to himself and the singing slaves—the actors are in a sense "unaware" that they have an audience. They are both in the "deep pine woods." Indeed, as if replying to an objection that the two activities are *not* similar, Douglass seems to argue that the slaves' singing is only not *obviously* a debate. Thus, although he grants that when he himself was a slave and sang those same songs, he did not know what he was really doing (those songs, he says, were at that point "altogether beyond my feeble comprehension"), Douglass goes on to assert that the truly "thoughtful" and "spiritual minded" who wanted to "sound the mysterious depths" of the slaves' thoughts and feelings *could* understand what the slaves were doing in those songs. Moreover, Douglass not only makes clear that he is referring to the slaves singing at a time when the slaves were "comparatively free; and if thoughtful, had time to think"; he explicitly warns that the songs are only *apparently* incoherent. Though the slaves used "improvised" words that were "jargon to others," Douglass argues, these words were nevertheless "full of … meaning" *to* the slaves.

Taken all together, Douglass seems to have been telling his readers that "thoughtful" and "spiritual minded" men and women would

indeed hear in the slaves' singing something like a debate among people bewildered by their extraordinary circumstances, perplexed about what they ought to do, and inventing a vocabulary to express their perplexities to each other, in order to decide how best to deal with their predicament. They chose the medium of song to do this partly because singing was the only manifestly expressive activity they were allowed to engage in, and partly because it contains resources that can compensate for a paucity of vocabulary.

A person debating with herself or others about what she ought to do understands that sometimes what she does is up to her; that though she may in those cases do what she pleases, she ought to do what is best; that what is best is determined by reasons; that such reasons are usually discovered by close examination of her circumstances and her sentiments; and that reasons often have to be weighed against each other. Kantians tend to refer to the capacity to engage in such activities as the ground of an unforfeitable human dignity. Douglass wanted to suggest that it showed a capacity for freedom and that the fact that the slaves preferred to engage in the arduous activity of exercising that capacity in the rare moments that they were spared a short respite from pain and toil, over simply enjoying the respite, would reveal to their thoughtful, spiritual-minded listeners that they sorrowed more for the loss of their freedom than for their physical ills. If so, those listeners would secure an idea of the slaves' sorrow *with its proper object*, and then in accordance with Hume's theory of sympathy, that idea in the listeners would be enlivened into actual sorrow, (both because of their human resemblance to the slaves and because they too would be inclined to sorrow more for the loss of freedom than for physical ills).

According to Douglass, then, "spiritual minded" men and women could achieve a Du Boisian sympathy with the slaves, not by putting themselves in the slaves' place, but by "thoughtfully" analyzing the sounds that passed through the chambers their souls. This suggests that he believed that emotions expressed in soliloquy can carry

far more information about the details of the emotion than Smith and probably Hume seemed to allow. In particular, Smith's view that observers tend almost automatically to put themselves in the place of the agent, in order to fill out details for the emotion they observe, implies that expressions of emotion normally carry minimal information that would explain the emotion in question. Douglass warns, however, that yielding to the tendency to put oneself into the place of those whom we are observing probably *prevents* understanding the slaves' expressions of emotion. In the case at hand the observers who imagined themselves in the slaves' place, but using their own ideologically shaped reason and judgment, would believe that the slaves sang sorrowfully because of the physical cruelties of slavery. If Delany was right, for example, Stowe got caught in Smith's trap when she misunderstood the slaves' sorrow and pitied them for the physical cruelties they suffered rather than for the loss of their liberty. By contrast, Douglass put his thoughtful and spiritual-minded listener in the "deep pine woods" because people are normally tempted to do more, or other, than express their feelings when they know they have an attentive audience, even if they believe that the audience is on their side. For example, the slaves might try to impress their listener by decorating their singing with beauty, which might draw her attention away from the feelings that they were expressing. The Fisk Jubilee Singers did this and as a result may have foiled the Du Boisian sympathy for the slaves that their singing might have otherwise encouraged.

## *Du Bois's Two Projects*

Douglass's views suggest that Du Bois failed in his primary goal of creating a Du Boisian sympathy for Crummell in his white readers, at least if we assume that they were not among the thoughtful and spiritual-minded persons Douglass spoke of. Du Bois wrote at greatest length on three of Crummell's emotions, his hate even as a child, his despair, and his doubt as a young man. His choice of emotions to emphasize was reasonable given that hate, despair, and doubt are associated in various ways with sorrow and the loss of dignity. But again, if Douglass is right, then sympathy would not suffice to infuse these emotions into readers. Indeed, Du Bois's comment that his white readers would find hate a "strange temptation for a child"28 already concedes this about Crummell's hate. And Du Bois's description of Crummell's despair must have fared even worse. Du Bois relates that Crummell despaired when the Episcopal Seminary rejected his application to study for the priesthood because he was a Negro, thus suggesting that he despaired because the seminary's decision reduced his chances of becoming a priest. But Du Bois's white readers would think that if they were in his place, a black man living in nineteenth-century America, they would know before they applied for admission to the seminary that it would very likely reject his application. Consequently, they would not see its rejection as drastically reducing his chances to complete his plans. So it is hard to see how they would sympathize with his falling into despair as a result. Finally, Du Bois's story, that Crummell doubted his people's moral capacities when his first attempt to educate them failed, misrepresents Crummell's doubt, making it impossible for sympathy to transfuse that doubt into his white readers. Putting themselves in his place, white readers would think, "No sensible person doubts that a cherished goal is achievable just because his *first* attempt to achieve it fails."

And yet, it would be wrong to conclude from the foregoing that Du Bois did better at his second project simply because his black readers were more "spiritual minded" than his white readers. Du Bois succeeded in this second project because his black readers were liable to

<sup>28</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 136.

read the essay with passions that resembled Crummell's. This follows from Hume's comment that "we never remark any passion in others, of which in some degree or other, we may not find a parallel in ourselves," and that "resemblance must very much contribute to make us enter into the sentiments of others." Presumably, this is partly because such "parallel passions" between observer and agent help supply detail to the idea that the observer forms of the agent's passion. At a minimum, the resemblance between parallel passions must enable the observer to make educated guesses about the causes of the agent's passion even if the agent's expressions are concealed or muted or simply not accompanied by much explicit explanation. Du Bois's comment that "a thousand thousand black children brood" in hate in circumstances similar to Crummell's suggests that he was relying on parallel passions in his black readers and in Crummell to enable those readers to get accurate ideas of Crummell's passions. For similar reasons, Du Bois's black readers would not think that Crummell despaired because the seminary's rejection of his application lowered his chances of becoming a priest. Relying on their own parallel despairs, they would see that he despaired because the rejection brought vividly to his mind the sheer improbability of his ever reaching his goal.

## *Dignity*

As we have seen, Du Bois's tale showed Crummell fighting losing battles against the enemies of his visions of life; tempted sorely by hate, despair, and doubt; driven into wandering the world in search of knowledge of himself; and finally after twenty years returning home from Africa, "out of the temptation of Hate," "burned by the fire of Despair," and "triumphant over doubt." Du Bois's exultant tone suggests that Crummell had not only fought his menacing vices to a draw, but routed them and returned home invulnerable to them. If so, he returned home with faith, hope, and love, the virtues tradition and logic suggest are incompatible with hate, despair, and doubt. Given that he also returned home with dignity—and Du Bois told his tale of Crummell's struggles with the vices to suggest how they too could return home with dignity—we may reasonably conclude that faith, hope, and love are among the parts of dignity. But they cannot wholly constitute it. Du Bois presented Crummell with faith, hope, and love only *after* he had triumphed over hate, despair, and doubt. Therefore something other than those virtues must have accounted for his triumph, and consequently may also be a part of dignity.

Presumably Du Bois took care to display it conspicuously given the nature of his second project, and supposing that the first sentence of his tale is conspicuous enough and announces that that even as a boy Crummell "struggled with life that he might know the world and know himself."29 I will assume that this struggle accounted for his triumph over hate, despair, and doubt, and was therefore a part of his dignity. Let us therefore get clearer on that struggle.

Presumably it was motivated by a perplexity about who, or what, he was. According to Du Bois such a perplexity was common among thoughtful black people. Every such person, he observed, has asked himself the question "What after all am I?" Since asking the question cannot lead to dignity, given that most do not get there, we must suppose that it led Crummell to dignity because of the consequences of his persistence in trying to answer it. In that case Du Bois suggests that if Crummell reasoned soundly, he would encounter three further questions that Du Bois implied would lead him to the correct answer to the first fundamental question, "What after all am I?" These three questions were "Am I an American or am I a Negro? Can I be both? Or is it my duty to cease to be a Negro as soon as possible, and be an American?"30

<sup>29</sup> Du Bois, "Of Alexander Crummell," *Souls of Black Folk*, 134.

<sup>30</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 180.

The first of these three questions may suggest that in trying to know what he was, Crummell would try to know who his biological ancestors were. But the third indicates that if Crummell was reasoning soundly, efforts to know what he was would never lead him to seek to know who his biological ancestors were; no one can have a duty to choose her ancestors because no one can choose her ancestors. The third question about a duty to cease or not to cease being a Negro therefore implies that Du Bois was not thinking of race as a biological category but as a category you could choose to join or leave, although one could be born into it too; and something that one could have a duty to join or to leave, and as we shall see presently something that entails having certain duties. In short Du Bois's third question implied that being a Negro was somewhat like being an American. And if that third question was an elucidation of the first, then Du Bois implied that Crummell's search for self-knowledge—if he reasoned correctly—would eventually turn out to be basically a search for certain of his duties: did he have a duty to be a Negro or an American? And did he have duties as a Negro or as American?

Du Bois implied that if Crummell answered these questions correctly he would conclude that he had duties to be *both* American and Negro, and consequently duties as a Negro and as an American. He could consistently have those two sets of duties. His duties as a Negro were to pursue the distinctive cultural and moral ideals of his race. His duties as an American had their source in a liberalism that guaranteed him a right to pursue a variety of cultural and moral ideals. Therefore he could consistently pursue his duties as a Negro and as an American. Du Bois's comment that there was no reason why "men of different races might not strive together for their race ideals as well, perhaps even better, than in isolation" makes the point.31

<sup>31</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 181.

Crummell did not agree with Du Bois. Perhaps his return home suggests that he agreed that he had a duty to be an American and duties as an American. And perhaps his devoting his life there to the education of his people suggests that he agreed that he had duties as a Negro. But he did not agree that he had a duty *to be* a Negro because he believed that Negroes were a biological category and that he therefore had no choice and so no duty to be a Negro. And he did not agree with Du Bois about what his duties as a Negro were. He could not because Du Bois believed that those duties were to pursue and perfect the distinctive cultural and moral ideals of the race, and he believed that slavery had so thoroughly corrupted the Negro race that it had no cultural and moral ideals worth preserving. In his view his duty as a Negro was to educate Negroes, morally inculcating in them the ideals that slavery had torn from them. And when his early attempts at such education failed, he began to suspect that the Negro's corruption was not after all caused by slavery, but went deeper, and had its source in Africa. A letter written after his residence there suggests that he eventually moderated that suspicion. It reads: "Our ancestors were unfortunate, miserable, and benighted, but nothing more. Their history was a history, not of ignominy and disgrace, but of heathenism and benightedness. And even in that state they exhibited a nobleness of native character, they cherished such virtues, and manifested … manliness and bravery."32 But it does not follow that he had also moderated his view that slavery had thoroughly corrupted Africans in America. Indeed he insisted after its abolition that blacks should avoid even recalling it, since it was a "degrading thing," and recalling it led "by the law of association" to degradation.33

Du Bois's love of the sorrow songs indicates that he scouted this view. He agreed that slavery was a degrading thing, but insisted that

<sup>33</sup> Alexander Crummell, "The Need of New Ideas and New Aims," in *Africa and America* (1891; repr. Miami: Mnemosyne, 1969), 19.

the sorrow songs, the most beautiful music composed in America, conceived and realized by Negroes in slavery, proved that if slavery had corrupted them, it had not corrupted them completely, leaving them still capable of great moral and aesthetic creativity. Moreover, in his view the sorrow songs were not a fluke, but a consequence of human beings in great adversity and more generally an aspect of the processes that create races. Races are created when groups of individuals struggle together for generations to survive in distinctive circumstances that often involve great adversity. These individuals may be, but are not necessarily, biologically related. Rather they are related and bound together by the fact that later members of the group learn from and improve on the findings of earlier members about how to deal with adversity and to survive in the circumstances they find and make for themselves. Supposing that values are discovered or invented through such processes, and differ if the findings of the different races differ, every race will eventually discover or invent some distinctive values, or as Du Bois often put it, distinctive "ideals of life."

Even if he was right it does not follow that the members of a race have duties to pursue the distinctive ideals of their race. The liberalism that Du Bois appealed to earlier to show the compatibility of American and Negro duties insists that the members of a race in a liberal state are free to pursue a variety of ideals, as long as they fulfill their duties to the state. To answer that challenge Du Bois moved the issue to a larger stage. The members of a race have duties to pursue the distinctive ideals of their race because they have duties to help perfect humanity. Like Kant, whose concern for the prospects of humanity led him to claim that individuals have duties to seek peace so that humanity can perfect its talents, Du Bois claimed that individuals have duties to perfect their racial ideals in order to help guide humanity "nearer and nearer that perfection of life for which we all long," that "one far off Divine Event."34

<sup>34</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 176.

The idea that such ideals could help guide humanity in this way is not implausible. Ideals useful to humanity are not exclusively the handiwork of seers, but also that of people conducting "experiments in living" in order to find good ways to live. Since the races are precisely such people organized into groups, then given generally egalitarian assumptions, the ideals that races glean from their "experiments" may very well help humanity to better itself. Liberals might still object that individuals do not have duties to perfect humanity, and therefore cannot have duties to perfect their racial ideals. But Du Bois was not that kind of liberal. On the contrary, Du Bois's definition of race as a group of people "always of common … impulses" and "both voluntarily and involuntarily striving together for the accomplishment" of their "more or less vividly conceived," implies that individuals do have imperfect duties to not merely perfect humanity, but specifically to perfect their racial ideals.35

Of course, it might be objected that if the members of a race have such powerful impulses to strive to perfect their racial ideals voluntarily or involuntarily, they will inevitably strive to perfect their racial ideals and consequently cannot have duties to do so. But the fact that people have strong impulses to act in one way does not mean that they cannot also have strong impulses to act in opposite ways. Nor does it mean that they cannot for some reason resist their own impulses. Moreover, people may strive for their racial ideals not intending to do so, because they do not know that the ideals they strive for are their racial ideals; and in that case, since they only strive for their racial ideals involuntarily, they cannot strive for them as duties they have as members of the race. In other words, Du Bois was not saying that Crummell and black people generally would or should strive for their racial ideals for any old reason. He meant

<sup>35</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 176.

that they had duties to perfect their racial ideals, and they have they duties because they are black people. Crummell's story illustrates the point. As a youth stirred by sympathy with his schoolmates and the distant slaves, he had a "vision" in which he was called to lead the slaves "out of the house of bondage." In his striving to do so he was striving to realize the ideals of his race, since freedom was in fact among its ideals, but he did not understand what he was doing since, as we have seen, he believed that slavery had so corrupted his race that it had no ideals worth striving for. Consequently his striving for his ideals was "involuntary" and not undertaken as a duty. Further, he did not see his striving for the freedom of his race as a duty that he had as a Negro. Since he believed that Negroes were simply people of common blood, when he thought that he had a duty to lead them to freedom, he was supposing—mistakenly—that he had such duties simply because he shared ancestors with them. He did not see that he had such duties because of a further greater duty to help guide humanity to its perfection, and that in fulfilling these duties he was being true to his—and his people's—own deepest and most valuable impulses and ideals.

Though Crummell never understood or truly acknowledged his racial impulses and ideals, they helped save him from the vices of hate, despair, and doubt, and eventually led him to dignity. The conflicts of those impulses with the deep and opposing impulses and ideals that he inevitably acquired as a Negro living in America made him feel that he was divided into two different warring individuals, provoked him to ask vainly which of these individuals he really was, and left him with a double consciousness, wandering the world, a "soul in search of itself." He got nowhere near finding himself until he understood that, to do so, he first had to answer another question that had ever "gnawed" as him: "What, in God's name, am I on earth for?"36

<sup>36</sup> Du Bois, *Souls of Black Folk*, 141.

In other words he eventually came to understand that the question "What am I really?" was a moral question, requiring that he stand back from, and reflect on, his two warring selves and ask himself the question "Which of the two warring individuals within myself do I have a *duty* to be?"

He never arrived at the correct answer to it, according to Du Bois, namely that he had a duty to be both. He might have come to see that he was an American with the duties of an American, and that he had duties as a Negro. But he never understood what it meant to be a Negro, or therefore why he had duties as a Negro. But he got closer to the right answer than it might at first appear. When he failed abjectly at his first attempt at moral education and mourned in despair and doubt that his people were "dumb driven cattle," corrupted even before the disaster of slavery, he was on the verge of acknowledging that he could choose whether to distance himself from them morally, whether to contemn them, whether to be one of them. And he remained on that verge until he lived in Africa and concluded that his ancestors "exhibited a nobleness of native character, … cherished such virtues, and manifested … manliness and bravery." At that point he was in fact finally choosing irrevocably to be a Negro, not because he shared their "blood," for this he had always known, but because he shared their ideals through sharing a considerable part of their history. Consequently, when he returned home and devoted himself to the education of his people, it was not as if he was inculcating in them ideals that were altogether foreign to them. It was as if he was arousing awareness of ideals that they might have learned from their ancestors that slavery had driven underground, but that could with proper education be brought to full consciousness. This position was not identical to Du Bois's, for it did not admit that Negroes had continued the process of building ideals even in slavery, but it was close enough to lead to his triumph over hate, despair, and doubt and ultimately to

achieve dignity. For it meant that he had found his place in the world and answered the question why he was on earth. He was on earth to educate his people back into virtue. And he was assured of eventual victory, for he was educating a people who though outwardly corrupted still heard echoes of the learned virtues of their ancestors and could be made virtuous again.

# *Reflection*: Death and Dignity in American Law 
*Emma Kaufman*

Dignity serves many purposes in American jurisprudence. Over the past century, courts in the United States have invoked the concept of dignity to limit intrusive searches by the police and to bar discrimination on account of race and gender.1 Dignity surfaces in discussions of sexual violence, marriage, citizenship, and the privacy of both the body and the home.2 Yet nowhere is this concept more vital than debates about the death penalty. In American law, dignity's most prominent role is to mediate the state's capacity to kill.

An account of the relationship between dignity and capital punishment requires some context. At present, the United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world.3 Men of color are

especially likely to be imprisoned. In 2008, black men were six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men of the same age, and today, close to one in three African American men will be incarcerated in his lifetime.4 The penal institutions in which these people are held, though varied, are notoriously harsh.

Like incarceration rates, the death penalty is related to structural inequities in wealth and power, and in particular, to race. In the now famous Baldus study, a group of social scientists found that defendants who murdered white victims were more than four times as likely to be sentenced to death as those who killed people of color.5 These numbers grow even more disproportionate when the defendant is black,6 and become especially sobering in a comparative frame. The United States is one of only 18 countries in the United Nations, a body composed of 193 member states, to use the death penalty. It is the only western country that permits the punishment of death.7

There was a time, not long ago, when capital punishment was illegal in the United States. In 1972, the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty violated the Eighth Amendment's

prohibition on "cruel and unusual" punishment.8 That case, *Furman v. Georgia*, established a moratorium on capital punishment that lasted four years.9 The *Furman* decision was fractured—no justice wholly endorsed another's reasoning—but in each concurrence, dignity did significant conceptual work. Justice William Brennan began his oft-cited opinion with a declaration: "The basic concept underlying the [ban on cruel and unusual punishment] is nothing less than the dignity of man."10 He went on to extract from this claim a set of rules about when punishment comports with the Constitution. First, the Justice argued, punishment that is too severe is "degrading to the dignity of human beings."11 Dignity also prohibits the "arbitrary infliction" of punishment and requires social acceptance for a sanction to be just.12 Finally, Justice Brennan wrote, punishment "must not be excessive," for it violates "human dignity" to impose one punishment when an adequate and more moderate alternative exists.13

Justice Brennan's voice was not the only one in *Furman v. Georgia*, but his reasoning reflects a key feature of dignity's treatment in the law. In this opinion, a moment when dignity did some of its heaviest lifting, the concept was less a quality of personhood than a principle of governance. Dignity is neither clearly defined nor especially tied to human nature in the Supreme

<sup>8 <</sup>i>Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972). To be clear, several justices argued that the death penalty was always unconstitutional, while others held that it was unconstitutional as applied in practice in the United States.

Court's analysis of the death penalty. Instead, the term grounds a particular vision of political organization. Justice Brennan derived from dignity the values of moderation, democratic participation, and consistency in the application of law. His opinion, and others that have followed it, repeatedly stated that dignity requires "civilized" societies to constrain punishment.14 Justice Thurgood Marshall used similar diction, condemning the death penalty as a punishment inconsistent with "practices of other civilized nations of the world."15

In each of these texts, dignity is cited as an innate human quality, but employed for a different end—namely, to instantiate a relationship between a government and its citizenry. While capital punishment cases speak of persons bearing an inherent dignity, the project of these cases is to determine whether *the state* will act in a "dignified" manner. Dignity seems less inherent than constructed in this account, and the term encompasses the state as well as the individual. While Justices write of dignity as a human attribute, they use dignity to model a form of recognition between those in and subject to power. This is not "dignity" in its classic sense. In death penalty cases, dignity describes a dynamic between the subject and the state.

This approach to dignity, which centers on governance rather than human nature, displaces a more individuated account of the term. One consequence of using dignity to describe the behavior of governments is that individuals, and the bodies they inhabit, go curiously missing from legal analysis. Discussions of capital punishment are deeply embodied—the debate at issue is whether humans, confined in metal cages, should be electrocuted or drugged to death for violating the criminal code. Yet legal treatises

on dignity tend to obscure the physicality and affect of capital punishment, or at least to distinguish pain from dignitary harms. (See Fig. 11R1 and Fig. 11R2)

"Pain, certainly, may be a factor" in condemnation of the death penalty, Justice Brennan wrote in *Furman v. Georgia*. But "the pain involved" is not the source of capital punishment's indignity.16 Rather, "The true significance of these punishments is that they …. reflect the attitude that the person punished is not entitled to recognition as a fellow human being."17 This claim captures the relevance of recognition: in *Furman*, dignity is the status, conferred by law, of being acknowledged and respected by one's government. Justice Brennan's writing also highlights the tenuous but crucial relationship between bodies and legal sanctions. In legal writing on the death penalty, dignity translates the treatment of bodies into a normative vision of criminal justice. The concept of dignity turns killing or not killing a human into the measure of a polity's "civility."

This account raises questions about the exchange between dignity and governance. Does dignity exist in the absence of the law? Can it persist outside a political community? Does a relational notion of dignity enhance or undermine the treatment of individuals? These questions lie just below the surface of Supreme Court cases on capital punishment.18 The *Furman* decision was only a moment in time, and a fleeting one at that. But the opinion hints at a view of punishment in which dignity is a fundamentally relational concept, less a characteristic of personhood than a state of existing in dialogue with the law. This vision of dignity is more

<sup>18</sup> Jeremy Waldron and Meir Dan-Cohen, among others, have explored these questions about dignity's dependence on the law. See Meir Dan-Cohen, "Defending Dignity," in *Harmful Thoughts: Essays on Law, Self, and Morality* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2002), 150–71; Jeremy Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, ed. Meir Dan-Cohen (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012).

institutional, more community-based, and more alienable than conceptions that emphasize unwavering and individuated worth.19 Yet, if the law renders dignity more contingent, it also uses the term to advance an implicit critique of government. When dignity does its most compelling work, this concept serves to limit or license the flow of state power.

The contradiction, of course, is that dignity surfaces at precisely the points when the law is most harsh.20 One might ask what becomes of dignity when people—usually people with young, black bodies—continue to live in brutal carceral conditions and on "death rows."21 It may be that these people retain a quality that endures in the face of punishment, and that we ought to call that quality dignity. Alternatively, it could be that dignity is a relationship between people and polities, one that disappears when governments incarcerate and kill. This is the picture that emerges from death penalty jurisprudence. In *Furman v. Georgia*, dignity tracks the presence or absence of acknowledgment in a system of power. Dignity is a way to understand, to critique, and perhaps to change practices of recognition in societies that sentence people to death.

<sup>20</sup> Jeremy Waldron notes that, for precisely this reason, Stephen Pinker describes dignity as a concept that "spawns outright contradictions at every turn." Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 211; see also Stephen Pinker, "The Stupidity of Dignity," *New Republic*, May 28, 2008, http://www.tnr.com/story_ print.html?id=d8731cf4-e87b-4d88-b7e7-f5059cd0bfbd.

<sup>21</sup> In 2014, more than three thousand people awaited death in prison. Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), *Death Row Inmates by State*, http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/death-row-inmatesstate-and-size-death-row-year. This number is significant, though tiny in comparison to the incarcerated population, which is between 1 and 2.4 million depending on which facilities are included in the count. Peter Wagner and Leah Sakala, "Mass Incarceration: The Whole Pie," *Prison Policy Initiative*, http://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie.html. David Garland has written about how the peculiarity of the death penalty—the fact that it is rarely used, yet persists in a growing culture of prison reform reflects deeper conflicts in American culture.
