# Chapter 6: Equal Dignity and Rights

*Stephen Darwall*

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  
> —American Declaration of Independence  
> Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family …   
—Universal Declaration of Human Rights[^1]  
> (Article 1) Human dignity shall be inviolable. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority. (Article 2) The German people therefore acknowledge inviolable and inalienable human rights as the basis of every community, of peace and of justice in the world.  
> —The Basic Law, Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany[^2]

The idea that human persons have a distinctive value or *dignity* that is intimately bound up with basic human rights has proven one of the Enlightenment's most enduring legacies. Germany's *Grundgesetz* declares quite explicitly that human dignity is "inviolable," and "*therefore*" that "inviolable and inalienable human rights" must be acknowledged. We find a similar idea in the American Declaration of Independence. "Dignity" doesn't appear, but the claim is implicit that "all men" share a fundamentally equal status that entails or includes basic inalienable rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights also lacks the *Grundgesetz*'s "therefore," but it nonetheless clearly also ties human dignity and rights closely together.

The main question I want to consider in this chapter is how human dignity must be conceived if it is to be capable of grounding human rights. There is no doubt, however, that different conceptions, even different concepts, of dignity have figured in the history of moral and political thought. And many of these bear no relation to human rights whatsoever.

## Ciceronian Dignity

"Dignity" originally referred to high social rank or status and "the honors and respectful treatment that are due to someone who occupied that position," as Michael Rosen puts it.[^3] According to Christopher McCrudden, this is the sense of "*dignitas hominis* in classical Roman thought."[^4] As McCrudden and Rosen read the history, it was Cicero's *De Officiis* that marked an important and influential departure from the originally social-conventional sense of "dignity." Although Cicero sometimes uses *dignitas* in its customary social sense, he also introduces the idea of "the dignity of the human race." *Human* dignity for Cicero is nothing that could be established by conventional patterns of deference. It is the idea, rooted in the ancient notion of a great chain of being, that distinctive capacities for self-development "by study and reflection" give human beings a "nature" "superior" to that of "cattle and other animals." Other species are motivated only by sensory instincts, whereas human beings can "learn that sensual pleasure is wholly unworthy of the dignity of the human race," and be guided by this understanding.[^5]

This early Ciceronian theme reverberates throughout the dignity tradition, including most prominently Kant.[^6] It finds something of a modernizing twist in the Renaissance thinker Pico della Mirandola. For Pico, human dignity is rooted in the human capacity to shape one's own life: "It is given to him to have that which he chooses and to be what he wills."[^7]

A deep connection between the human capacity for autonomous rational choice and a dignity that can ground human rights is, I shall argue, a central aspect of the notion of human dignity as it developed in the early modern period, especially in the tradition of modern natural law of Grotius and Pufendorf. It should be clear, however, that nothing in the Ciceronian notion of human dignity requires, or even leads naturally to, basic human rights. The proposition, for example, that "sensual pleasure" is "unworthy" of human dignity is less a thesis about what human beings are in a position to claim from one another by virtue of their dignity than it is an ethical standard to which we are to live up. Similarly, although Pico held that human dignity depends on the capacity for human choice, his point was not to argue for a fundamental right to shape one's life as one will, but to set up an argument that human beings *should* choose, of their own will, to live a certain kind of life, indeed, an angelic life.[^8]

"Dignity" in many of its uses carries similar connotations of an aspirational standard one should live up to, or not sink below, as in "That would be beneath your dignity." Carrying oneself "with dignity" or being "dignified" is conducting oneself in ways that others can look up to or at least not down on. When used in this sense, the synonym of "dignity" is "noble" and its antonym, "base." It implies, as well, that its bearer, a person *having* dignity, lives up to the standard from her own sense that not to would be beneath her. She thus achieves a kind of (appraisal) self-respect and avoids what would elicit her own contempt.[^9]

Hume uses "dignity" in this sense when he speaks of "dignity of character" as including "elevation of mind" or "sentiment": "disdain of slavery, and with that noble pride and spirit, which arises from conscious virtue."[^10] Dignity here is a justified sense of one's own merit, that one is an appropriate object of esteem, one's own and others. We find the same thought in Adam Smith when, following Hume, he distinguishes between the "amiable" virtues of "candid condescension and indulgent humanity" and "awful" virtues "of self-denial, of self-government, of that command of the passions which subjects all the movements of our nature to what our own dignity and honour, and the propriety of our own conduct require."[^11]

These uses of dignity are Ciceronian in implicating a standard of virtuous self-command that is rooted in a "superior" human capacity to govern passions and instincts we share with other animals. Mill's familiar doctrine of higher and lower pleasures imports this Ciceronian notion into a view of human welfare, as does its lesser known precursor in Frances Hutcheson. First, Hutcheson:

> In comparing pleasures of different kinds, the value is as the duration and dignity of the kind jointly. We have an immediate sense of a dignity, a perfection, or beatifick quality in some kinds, which no intenseness of the lower kinds can equal, were they also as lasting as we could wish. No intenseness or duration of any external sensation gives it a dignity or worth equal to that of the improvement of the soul by knowledge, or the ingenious arts; and much less is it equal to that of virtuous affections and actions.[^12]

As Mill would later, Hutcheson holds that some pleasures are intrinsically higher, therefore better, than others. As Mill put it memorably, "It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied."[^13] Why does a human being "never wish to sink into what he feels is a lower grade of existence"? Mill answers: "a sense of dignity, which all human beings possess in one form or other."[^14]

These claims directly concern what makes life better for the person living it, well-being rather than either merit (warranted esteem) or superior normative standing in a "great chain of being." But when pleasures are said to be better for those who have them *because* of their dignity, then dignity is being invoked as a normative concept that is independent of well-being, namely, of merit or superior normative standing. The claim is that experiences and activities that warrant esteem, and of which we can be justifiably proud, benefit us more, and because we can be proud of them, or for the reasons that warrant pride and esteem.

Obviously, any concept of dignity capable of grounding or entailing claims of human right must be normative. Moreover, human rights claims are a distinctive *kind* of normative claim, entailing obligations to rights holders to respect their rights, and therefore implicating all that is necessary for such correlative rights and obligations to exist. I shall be arguing, following earlier work of mine, that the normativity of basic human rights is irreducibly second personal and that any normative proposition capable of grounding human rights must therefore also be second personal, or justifiable within a second-personal framework.[^15]

Even without any such analysis, however, we can see that Ciceronian dignity is not a normative concept of the right kind to entail claims of right. That I am a being capable of realizing distinctively human virtues and excellences, or even that I do realize these, has no necessary bearing on human rights whatsoever. A philosopher might reject the whole idea of human rights while thoroughly accepting the kinds of Ciceronian claims about human dignity we have been canvassing.

## Dignity, Rank, and Rights

Recall the original sense of "dignity" as high social status and rank: a place of honor. Since this often included, as Rosen points out, "the honors and respectful treatment that are due to someone who occupied that position," perhaps it would be more promising to model a concept of human dignity capable of grounding rights on this sense.[^16] An obvious problem with doing so, however, is that social status is not a normative notion. Patterns of deference and respectful treatment constituting high status de facto entail nothing about how people in that position *should* be treated (de jure) or about normatively valid claims they might therefore have on others or others' correlative obligations to them. This comes out clearly in Hobbes's definition of dignity in *Leviathan*:

> The public worth of a man, which is the value set on him by the commonwealth, is that which men commonly call dignity. And this value of him by the commonwealth, is understood, by offices of command, judicature, public employment; or by names and titles, introduced for distinction of such value.[^17]

A person's dignity, according to Hobbes, his "public worth," is constituted by how others actually value him, by how they honor him by "offices of command," through their deference to him, and by other public valuing conduct: "The manifestation of the value we set on one another, is that which is commonly called honouring, and dishonouring. To value a man at a high rate, is to *honour* him; at a low rate, is to *dishonour* him."[^18]

Just as consumers' preference-revealing purchases determine prices in a free market, so also is there a market in Hobbesian public worth or dignity, with deference and other forms of honoring playing the role of purchasing. Indeed, Hobbes says as much. "The *value,* or worth of a man, is as of all other things, his price; that is to say, so much as would be given for the use of his power."[^19] Public patterns of honoring ("paying tribute") establish people's "prices" and thereby measure their Hobbesian worth and dignity.

Hobbes's concept of dignity offers a stark contrast to Kant's famous distinction between dignity and price, which, as we shall see, had an important precursor in Pufendorf.[^20] For Kant, the dignity of persons is an absolute value defined in opposition to any "relative" value that can be priced—human dignity is "infinitely above all price."[^21]

Part of the reason that dignity as both Cicero and Kant conceive it differs from Hobbes's concept of dignity as social status is that the latter is a nonnormative social-economic fact, whereas for Cicero and Kant dignity is plainly normative. Even if certain rights and privileges were themselves part of an honored status, nothing would follow about whether these rights and privileges *should* be honored with the kind of respect that helps constitute the rights-including status as a social fact.[^22]

Thus far, then, we face a dilemma. On the one hand, a Ciceronian conception of dignity as a standard we should live up to seems impotent to even bear on the question of right. Moreover, this is so even if, as Kant holds, that standard includes duties that require us to act toward others in ways we believe to be required by human rights. If the standard were to include such duties, the justification dignity would provide for complying with them would be that it would be beneath *our* dignity not to treat human persons in the required ways, not that *their* dignity grounds *their* legitimate claims on us that we comply with these duties.

On the other hand, however, even if the very same rights we take to be basic human rights were to make up some honored status, any dignity consisting in that status would remain but a social fact, entailing only that others in fact relate to one *as if* one had these rights. It could not therefore ground the normative claim that anyone has these rights de jure. Dignity as a social construct can only generate rights de facto.

Recently, a number of writers, including Anthony Appiah and Jeremy Waldron, have called attention to historico-conceptual connections between dignity and honored status and have argued that the idea of human dignity is best framed within this context.[^23] Although dignity structured through deference and other forms of honoring treatment has historically been hierarchical, Waldron and Appiah suggest that it be subversively reconceived by, as it were, leveling everyone up to a place of honor that is structured by recognition and respect for the rights we take human dignity to involve or ground. Although orders of honor are usually hierarchical, structured by what Appiah calls "competitive honor," "peer honor" can also exist.[^24] Similarly, Waldron seconds a proposal he finds in an essay of Gregory Vlastos's: "that we organize ourselves not like a society without nobility or rank, but like an aristocratic society that has just one rank (and a pretty high rank at that) for all of us."[^25] In such a social order, "Everyone [would be] entitled to the sort of deference … in the way nobles were entitled to deference."[^26]

There is much to recommend subversively reconceiving honor along egalitarian lines. However welcome such an approach might be for other reasons, however, it cannot successfully frame a conception of dignity that can ground human rights. There are two main reasons for this. First, because honor and any dignity it can constitute are socially constructed social facts, any normative reasons for treating someone with honor and dignity, even if this involves according that person what we take to be human rights, must come from somewhere else. According to the idea we are tracking, human dignity and therefore rights derive from the nature of human beings or rational moral agents. For such a subversive reconception of honor to be successful, therefore, it would have to argue that there are good reasons, owing to the nature of human or rational moral agents, for according them this place of honor and, consequently, according them equal rights.

For our purposes, we can stipulate that this challenge can be met. Even if it can be, there will remain a second challenge that, in my view, such an approach cannot possibly meet. The reason has to do with a fundamental distinction between the kind of (recognition) respect that honor and socially constructed status involve, on the one hand, and the kind that is called for by human rights. I shall argue that (recognition) respect of the latter kind is essentially second personal (*second-personal respect*); it is an attitude that mediates forms of mutual accountability that are intrinsic to recognizing mutual rights and obligations. *Honor respect*, by contrast, is a form of deference that need not, and usually does not, engage second personally.

## The Second-Personal Character of Human Rights

To begin to make this argument, notice, first, second-personal aspects that are intrinsic to the very ideas of human rights and obligations that are correlative to them, as these notions began to be developed in the modern period, as I read the history, from Grotius on.[^27] The basic point is that rights of the relevant kind, moral claim rights, entail the (second personal) authority to make and hold others to demands of various kinds, so human dignity will be able ground such rights only if it includes or entails such an authority.

This point can be appreciated by reflecting on what it is to have a moral claim right. Consider an example I have often used—the right that one's feet not be stepped on without one's consent.[^28] It seems entirely possible for someone to avoid stepping on others' feet without regarding this as their right. A noble in an aristocratic order might see stepping on others' feet as ignoble or base, something that is beneath him. Clearly, in avoiding others' feet for this reason, he wouldn't be seeing it as anything to which anyone has a right. For that to be so, he would have to see others as having some authority to demand that he avoid their feet and to object and hold him to account if he does not.

Even, indeed, if he were to see stepping on someone else's foot as inconsistent with the *other's* honored status honored status, that might just mean that such treatment would treat him *below* his status, and thus be something he would naturally take as an insult and could be expected to resist and avenge if he was able, and indeed that would actually tend to lower his status, if he could not.

When the dignity of persons is called "inviolable" in documents like the *Grundgesetz*, that of course does not mean that it cannot be violated in actual fact. But crucially unlike honored statuses, when human dignity is violated, it is in no way diminished or lowered. Compare, in this way, an honored status that includes certain rights and privileges and that is constituted by patterns of public deference that signify treatment *as* having these rights, on the one hand, with the fundamental *normative* idea of the *Grundgesetz*: that because persons have equal dignity they have equal basic human rights de jure. If patterns of deference change, and people no longer recognize a status they formerly recognized, then that status with whatever "rights" it might have included no longer exists de facto. But that does not affect whether rights exist de jure. According to the enlightenment idea expressed in the *Grundgesetz*, human rights are valid even when they are violated because the dignity that undergirds them cannot be diminished or lowered in the way that an honored status can be. It follows that such dignity must include a fundamental de jure authority that persons have to make claims and demands of one another and hold each other mutually accountable.

Hugo Grotius, whose *Rights of War and Peace* is a foundational work on human rights, highlights what I am calling the second-personal aspect of basic human rights, when he says that "perfect rights" include "a faculty of demanding what is due," which faculty "answers the obligation of rendering what is owing."[^29] And Joel Feinberg makes what I take to be the same point in the late twentieth century when he says, "It is claiming that gives rights their special moral significance."[^30] Without rights, although others might accept norms requiring them to treat us in certain ways, we could not claim this is as our right. We would have, as Feinberg says, no place to "stand, … look others in the eye," and make claims on them.[^31]

It is thus part of the very idea of a human right—such as the right not to have our feet stepped on without our consent—that this is something we can demand from one another and to which we can legitimately hold each other. I call this authority "second personal," because it is a standing to *address* demands and hold one another accountable. Accountability is essentially relational in its nature, not just in the logical sense, but as involving *relatings* to persons that express distinctive second-personal, "reactive," holding-responsible attitudes that, as P. F. Strawson and a number of others have pointed out, have not just objects, but implicit *addressees*. [^32]

This, as I will illustrate further presently, is the fundamental difference between an order of honor and an order of rights involving mutual accountability. Even elevating everyone to the same high status as meriting the same honor, as Appiah and Waldron propose, cannot capture the notion, central to the idea of human rights, of fundamental *reciprocity* in the sense of mutual accountability. Citizens of a liberal democracy, or members of the moral community, are not just honor peers. They share not simply a common *status*, but also a common *authority* to make claims and demands of one another. They regard each other, in Rawls's words, as "self-originating sources of valid claims."[^33] What it is for persons or citizens to recognize one another's equal authority is thus for them to acknowledge it, second personally, by holding themselves answerable to one another for complying with legitimate claims and demands.

To put this one other way, respect for another human as an "equal citizen" or "moral person" with whom one shares a common basic dignity, is an attitude that inevitably calls for reciprocation—it comes, one might say, with an implicit RSVP. Whereas honor peers look *upon* each other as equals, mutually respecting citizens or moral subjects look *to* one another as equals with the expectation their look will be returned. Seeing ourselves as having rights against others enables us "to look others in the eye," and hold them accountable to us for their treatment of us, as we are to them for our treatment of them.

It follows that human rights can be grounded in the equal dignity of persons only if human dignity includes this second-personal, reciprocating aspect. The dignity of persons cannot therefore consist in any form of merit warranting esteem, however high, or any higher status or greater value that warrants honor or deference, again, however high. These are all concepts of the wrong kind to ground the second-personal authority that human rights conceptually implicate.

## Honor Respect versus Second-Personal Respect

It will help to consolidate these differences between orders of right and honor (even one including the status of peer with the very same rights as part of that status) if we say more about the distinct forms of recognition respect, *honor respect* and *second-personal respect*, that respectively mediate these.[^34] Both honor and second-personal respect are forms of *recognition respect* rather than *appraisal respect*, which is a form of esteem for someone's conduct or character.[^35] Both are realized in our conduct toward someone or in an attitude that, unlike esteem, is essentially concerned with the regulation of conduct.

We have just seen how fundamental rights, and obligations that are correlative to them, have an ineliminable second-personal element. Consider the right every person has not to be trodden upon. This is held against every other person. Equivalently, every person is obligated *to* every other person not to tread on him or her. These equivalent moral facts, are irreducibly second personal because they entail the equal second-personal authority of right holders to engage those obligated to them (obligees) in various distinctive ways, to claim that to which they have the right, as Feinberg says, and to hold their obligees answerable for respecting their rights.[^36] This is reflected, for example, in the fact that the right holder may waive her right or consent to what would otherwise violate it. Only she has this authority; others cannot waive it or consent for her. If her right is violated, even if others, or the state on their behalf, are in a position to blame her violator or hold him criminally responsible through legal punishment, the victim nonetheless has a distinctive authority others do not have to decide whether to seek compensation, to forgo it, or even to forgive her violator. This is why, in American courts, anyway, only the victim has standing to bring a tort action. It is thus part of the very idea of a fundamental claim right that the right holder has an *individual authority* to hold those against whom she holds the right personally accountable in these ways.

I call the form of respect that mediates an order of rights, as opposed to an order of honor, second personal for two reasons. First, as we have just noted, fundamental moral claim rights entail rights holders' second-personal authority to claim their rights from, and hold accountable, those against whom they are held. And second, authority of this kind can only be adequately recognized *second personally*, through relating *to* others in a way that *acknowledges* their second-personal authority. We realize second-person respect by relating *to* one another in ways that acknowledge each other's standing to demand, remonstrate, resist, charge, blame, resent, feel indignant, excuse, forgive, and so on. When others "look us in the eye" and claim their rights against us, we recognize their second-personal authority by looking back at them with acknowledgment.

As Strawson and others have argued, we hold people answerable through the distinctive second-personal attitudes that Strawson dubbed "reactive attitudes."[^37] Attitudes like indignation, resentment, blame, and guilt implicitly address demands to their objects and hold them accountable. They implicitly bid for reciprocating acknowledgment, and unlike purely retaliatory impulses, implicitly acknowledge their object's standing as a fellow member of the moral community.[^38] Whereas retaliatory impulses are satisfied only by the other's harm, reactive attitudes can be satisfied through acknowledgment of wrongdoing, apology, and the violator's holding himself accountable.

Compare now the form of respect that mediates status and rank. We accord honor respect by publicly recognizing or supporting someone's social self-presentation or *persona*. By contrast, when we look down on people or fail to support their self-presentation with contempt or disdain, we tend to lower their social status. "Looking someone out of countenance" can cause him to lose "face," his persona or the social role he has been attempting to play.

Honor respect and contempt are contraries: they sort people up and down in a status hierarchy. Second-personal respect, however, does not have a true contrary. Since negative reactive attitudes like blame and resentment address their objects as fellow moral agents, they actually express second-personal respect. They are thus second personal, whereas contempt, which does not necessarily address its object at all, is third personal.

Consider the difference between a disdainful rolling of the eyes and a look that expresses resentment or indignation ("looking daggers"). The latter addresses its object (with an RSVP) in a way that the former need not. For example, consider the "staredown" that the Italian ice dancer Barbara Fusar Poli gave her partner Maurizio Margaglio after he dropped her during the ice-dancing competition at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. According to one account, "When the music stopped, the two stood facing each other for nearly a minute at center ice, Fusar Poli steaming as her eyes burned through Margaglio" (Macur 2006). Or as one caption had it: "Barbara Fusar Poli to partner Maurizio Margaglio: Look me in the eye and tell how you dropped me."[^39] Suppose, however, that Fusar Poli had disdainfully rolled her eyes after the fall and skated off in disgust. Any expressive address in that instance would most likely have been to the *cognoscenti* off ice: "Can you believe what *he* just did?"

The psychologist John Gottman describes contempt as "speak[ing] from a higher plane" and as "closely related to disgust." "What disgust and contempt are about," he continues, "is completely rejecting and excluding someone from the community."[^40] Contempt can be internalized by its object as shame. To feel shame is to feel as if one is as one would seem to someone who viewed one with contempt: that is, contemptible or shameful. Contempt can thus lead to loss of face in two different ways. The first, we have already mentioned: contempt looks its object "out of countenance," thereby constituting its object's losing face in others' eyes. But consider, second, the natural expressions of internalized contempt or shame: blushing or hiding the face. These affect social self-presentation through the face quite literally. Whereas contempt excludes the other, a person feeling shame tends to exclude herself.

Notice how different the emotion that internalizes negative reactive attitudes like resentment and blame, namely guilt, is in this regard. Guilt is a felt acknowledgment of having violated some authoritative demand. If shame is the feeling of being as one would seem to someone who views one with contempt, guilt is the feeling of being as one would seem to someone who blames or resents one. It is the feeling that one has done something blameworthy and should be held, and that one should hold *oneself*, answerable for what one has done. Indeed, guilt partly constitutes holding oneself answerable. But whereas contempt and shame are exclusive, guilt is inclusive and engaging. Its natural expressions are second personal: acknowledgment of wrongdoing, apology, making amends, and self-addressed reproach.

It is because of this fundamental difference between honor and second-personal respect that honor respect is not an attitude of the right kind to be responsive to any dignity that can bear on human rights. Subverting honor hierarchies and treating every person with peer honor, as Appiah proposes, cannot, consequently, amount to recognizing, much less acknowledging, any dignity that can ground basic rights. If human rights are, as I've argued, second personal in their nature, then they can only be recognized adequately by a second-personal attitude. It follows that if human dignity is, as Kant claimed, that by which a person "exacts *respect* for himself from all other rational beings in the world," then both human dignity and the form of respect that responds to it must be second personal in their nature also.[^41]

## Equal Dignity and Human Rights in Pufendorf

In this final section, I will illustrate this conclusion further with what might seem an unlikely source: the natural law theory of Samuel Pufendorf. Pufendorf is a theological voluntarist who holds that morality derives from God's superior command, so how could he possibly be a source of the idea we have been considering? According to Pufendorf, however, what God commands as the "fundamental law of nature" is that "every man, so far as in him lies, should cultivate a sociable attitude."[^42] "By a sociable attitude," he adds, "we mean an attitude of each man towards every other man, by which each is understood to be bound … by a mutual obligation."[^43] Our fundamental moral obligation, in other words, is to cultivate an attitude through which we regard ourselves as morally bound, as equals, with every other person.

Since God's command is the source of morality, our most fundamental obligation is owed in the first instance to God. Even so, Pufendorf clearly holds that we comply with this obligation only if we hold ourselves obligated, and so answerable also, to every other human person. Human beings thus enjoy "an *equality of right*, which has its origin in the fact that an obligation to cultivate a social life is equally binding on all men, since it is an integral part of human nature as such."[^44] Because "human nature belongs equally to all men, and no one can live a social life with a person by whom he is not rated as a fellow man," it follows, as a precept of natural law, that "every man should esteem and treat another man as his equal by nature, or as much a man as he is himself."[^45] Mutual respect as equals is thus a corollary of the fundamental law of nature.

To regard others socially, consequently, is to see them as sharing a common basic standing with oneself that grounds or includes an ensemble of basic human rights to make demands of one another and hold each other to them. People "who, from a special feeling of their own superiority, would have every liberty reserved for themselves alone … and claim honor before other men," are "plainly unsocial."[^46]

Sociability thus includes the recognition of all men as equally entitled to fundamental respect or, as Pufendorf usually puts it, "esteem." "Esteem of persons in communal life … consists in this, that [the other] is regarded as the kind of person with whom … it may be possible to have intercourse."[^47] "Intercourse," like "sociable," is a normatively loaded term for Pufendorf. Just as taking a "sociable attitude" toward someone is already viewing her as entitled to certain forms of treatment and to hold others to these, so likewise, to relate to someone as apt for "intercourse" is to recognize her as having this same fundamental dignity and thereby to respect (in Pufendorf 's words, "esteem") her, as an equal to whom one is accountable for complying with "mutual" obligation to her and so her correlative rights.

"Esteem" is, for Pufendorf, a form of valuation we uniquely apply to "persons" and their distinctive value: "the value of persons in common life."[^48] Esteem thus contrasts with the way "things" are valued. "In common life," Pufendorf says, persons are "valued by" esteem and things are valued by their "price," anticipating Kant's later distinction between dignity and price, but in a way that understands, perhaps more explicitly than Kant, esteem or respect for human dignity to be a form of second-personal sociability. To esteem or respect others in this sense is to regard them as having the standing for "intercourse" as equals.

In connecting up rights and dignity in this way, Pufendorf stands at the beginning of the line of thought that leads to the *Grundgesetz*. Human beings carry with them "a most sensitive self-esteem" and are "rarely less and often more disturbed" by disrespect for their dignity "than if an injury were being offered [to their] person and property."[^49] When one's person or property is violated, the injury is generally twofold, indeed, since some insult is at least implicitly added, and so a second injury of disrespect, to the primary injury. The "most telling reply with which the rude insults of other men is met is, 'I am not a dog or a beast, but as much a man as you are.'"[^50]

Because of the connections between sociability, respect for equal dignity, and rights, arrogance "giv[es] occasion to a breach of peace."[^51] Indeed, peace, for Pufendorf, just is the condition in which people acknowledge one another's dignity and rights.[^52] Therefore, anyone who, in word or deed, presumes a superiority over others that cannot itself be justified from a fundamental standpoint of equality, as, for example, the authority of a political official that is properly grounded in an agreement or "pact," undermines peace and threatens war. To be peaceful, one must treat others not as "inferiors," but as equal "men."[^53]

In connecting the fundamental value of human moral agents, dignity, as we have come to call it, to basic rights and obligations via the (second personal) attitude of sociability, Pufendorf illustrates the point for which I have been arguing. Human dignity can bear directly on human rights only if it is capable of accounting for the second-personal character of these reciprocal rights and obligations. To ground the specific claims and demands that constitute specific human rights and obligations, the dignity of persons must either consist in or entail a shared (second personal) authority that can legitimate claim- and demand-making in general.

[^6]:  Rosen interprets Kant as holding that dignity is a value that is realized in moral action, when the agent imposes the moral law (pure practical reason) on herself despite (potential) inclinations to act otherwise (Rosen, *Dignity*, 19–31; see also Richard Dean, *The Value of Humanity in Kant's Moral Theory* [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006] and Stephen Darwall, "Kant on Respect, Dignity, and the Duty of Respect," in *Kant's Virtue*, ed. Monika Betzler [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 2008], 175–200). On this interpretation, Kant's view is not that any agent with the capacity for moral action has dignity; rather dignity is realized only by the good will that successfully exercises this capacity. Such a conception of dignity is a doubtful ground for human rights, as I shall be arguing.
