# *Reflection*: Taking Refuge from History in Morality: Marx, Morality, and Dignity

*Somogy Varga*

The Constitution of the Weimar Republic (1919) specified the institutional structures of the political system and laid down the fundament for a democratic welfare state. But it also went beyond a statement of traditional fundamental rights, linking the regulation of economic activity to the principles of justice and to a "dignified existence for all people."1 The fact that the concept of human dignity appears moderated behind the adjectival use2 is somewhat odd, but perhaps understandable given that pre-Weimar Germany both witnessed the remarkable rise of the concept of dignity with Kant and Schiller, and its most fierce denunciation by thinkers such as Schopenhauer, Marx, and Nietzsche.3

<sup>2</sup> Albeit moderated, its appearance in the context of a constitution and its link to rights is nevertheless remarkable, as it hasn't previously featured as a legal concept. See Jürgen Habermas, "The Concept of Human Dignity and the Realistic Utopia of Human Rights," *Metaphilosophy* 41 (2010): 468. See also McCrudden, "Human Dignity."

<sup>3</sup> Arguably, the adjectival use reflects that the constitution was itself, to a large degree, a compromise between liberal-democratic and Marxist ideologies with opposing views on the concept of dignity (and on moral vocabulary in general).

Among the critiques of dignity, it is perhaps Marx's view that has provided the most headache to scholars, partly because the general question whether Marx's theory has a moral dimension is one of the most controversial issues in Marx interpretation.4 The result is that—with a few exceptions5—Marx's view is often portrayed rather simplistically.6 Aiming to provide some clarification, this reflection will consider not only the general understanding of morality within historical materialism, but also a specific Kantian understanding of dignity that at least partly explains Marx's uncompromising view.

## Marx and Dignity: A Profound Ambivalence

Marx went to great lengths to express the bitterest criticism of bourgeois capitalist society while attempting to avoid anchoring his criticism in moral concepts. In addition to slogans like "Communists do not preach morality at all" in *The German Ideology*, he took pains to distance himself from fellow socialists who engage in a discourse of morality. A good example of this is found in his piece commenting on the work of another German socialist, Karl Heinzen, who described the rule of the

<sup>6</sup> Some of this is caused by general ambiguities about parts of Marx's stance on capitalism. It is beneficial to draw a parallel to Rousseau's attitude toward the kind of civilized social life he was confronted with in Paris. While Rousseau and Marx both despised the socioeconomic mechanisms they witnessed at play in their respective environments, they both regarded them necessary for the further development of human faculties. Thus, the overall attitude is not simply detestation, but bears witness of a profound ambivalence.

German princes as detrimental to the "dignity of man" (*Menschenwürde*). Marx writes:

Doughty "sound common sense" believes it explains the *rule of princes* by declaring itself *opposed* to it. The difficulty, from the standpoint of this norm of common sense, would, however, seem to consist in explaining how the opponent of sound common sense and of the moral dignity of man was born and how he dragged out his remarkably tenacious life for centuries. Nothing is simpler. The centuries did without sound common sense and the moral dignity of man. In other words, the sense and morality of centuries were in accordance with the rule of the princes instead of contradicting it.7

This passage provides a brief glimpse of Marx's motivations for adopting an uncompromising position. On the one hand, he entertained epistemic reasons for opposing formulating arguments against capitalism in moral terms on the grounds that this might undermine a clear-sighted scientific analysis.8 On the other hand, Marx was also convinced that the available moral vocabulary was compromised by its function of supporting prevailing power structures. Remarkably, he brings the abovequoted passage to a rhetorical culmination by forcefully suggesting that moral terms like dignity are little more than "empty phrases," and grounding social criticism amounts to "*taking refuge from history in morality*."9

<sup>8</sup> See Wilde, *Marxism's Ethical Thinkers*.

<sup>9</sup> It is worth noting that the question about the possible "emptiness" of the concept has returned. For an overview about the various forms in which skepticism about dignity occurs in contemporary discussion, see Michael Rosen, *Dignity: Its History and Meaning* (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2012), 1–11 (emphasis added).

It is not difficult to see that such a statement is in a strong tension with what Eugene Kamenka and others have identified as Marx's positive, even approving thoughts on human dignity, especially in his early years.10 Indeed, in the idealism of his (very) young years, Marx maintained that "dignity is that which raises man the most, which lends to his actions, to all his strivings, a higher nobility, which leaves him unimpaired, admired by the multitude and elevated above it."11 Later, Marx described the alienation of human beings in terms of their being robbed of their sense of self-worth, adding that alienated workers are people rendered "devoid of dignity." He maintains that the more value the worker creates, "the less value—the less dignity—he himself has," while in other places he opposes what he sees as a degradation (*Entwürdigung*) of human beings.12

From such passages, the impression is that a conception of dignity serves as a normative framework underpinning Marx's diagnosis of alienation—one that presupposes that a person can give form to her own abilities through autonomous labor. He vehemently opposes Adam Smith's view that labor always involves a sacrifice on the part of the worker, and that motivation is reducible to the achievement of external ends. Instead, Marx's point is that individuals in autonomous labor consciously exercise and expand their productive capacities ("species powers") as an end in itself. Such labor is experienced as inherently meaningful "partly

because through it they affirm both to themselves and to others their *dignity* as individuals and the worth of their lives and their humanity."13

In addition to central concepts such as alienation and labor, the concept of dignity also appears to be directly connected to the notion of class struggle. Honneth has argued that class struggle in the work of Marx is not simply a strategic battle to acquire goods or powers.14 Instead, it is understood as a form of moral conflict in which the oppressed class strives to ensure the social conditions for a type of autonomous work that grounds its dignity.15

In all, there is a rather manifest tension between Marx's positive and negative views on human dignity. However, as we shall see, this tension can be explained if we take into account some particular aspects in Marx's work.

## "Taking Refuge from History in Morality"

The fact that Marx bases his critique of capitalism on the claim that it frustrates many important goods like self-actualization, freedom, and a sense of dignity leaves us with a puzzle. Why is Marx's critique of capitalism at its base not a genuinely *moral* condemnation of capitalism? To provide a better understanding of this issue we need to take into account two issues: (1) the general understanding of morality within historical materialism and (2) the specific character of the Kantian notion of dignity that fuels Marx's

<sup>15</sup> See for instance chapter 23 in *Capital I* and Andreas Wildt, *Die Anthropologie des frühen Marx* (Hagen: Kurs der Fernuniversität, 1987). Lohmann's "Human Dignity and Socialism" rightly recognizes the role that the concept of dignity plays in Marx, but given Marx's underlying account of human self-realization, I think it might be too strong to claim that it "constitutes the encompassing normative standard of the Marxist critique of capitalism."

critical attitude. As we shall see, these issues are interlinked and connected to Marx's conviction that morality cannot be viewed as abstracted from concrete historical situations.

## *Morality and Historical Materialism*

Marx's understanding of the function of morality has its roots in the work of Hegel. Hegel understood the role of morality in history as mainly a conservative force that aims to preserve a particular societal form, and which extraordinary individuals help overthrow to make room for something new. Marx also thinks of morality as a chiefly conservative force, and he links it to the "superstructure" of a particular social order that is shaped by established relations of production (the sum of social relations specific to a particular mode of production that people must enter into). Very roughly, *historical materialism* comprehends morality and religion as supporting pillars of the "ideological superstructure" of society, and aims to explain their social influence by emphasizing their contribution to the economic realities of the societies in which they operate. As Marx often points out, particular religious and moral beliefs are functional ideologies, lending stability to social systems and assisting the enforcement of social relations that promote class interests and modes of production.16

Given the framework of historical materialism, it is intelligible that Marx rejects social criticism based on concepts like "dignity." Marx wants to resist claiming that individuals have something like a right to dignity, with some moral standard like justice commanding it, hence his critique of Heinzen as discussed earlier. From Marx's perspective, it makes little sense to reject alienation, enslavement,

<sup>16</sup> Engels formulates this quite precisely when he maintains that "men create their moral intuitions in the last instance out of the practical relations on which their class situation is founded—out of the economic relations in which they produce and exchange" (quoted in Wood, *Karl Marx*, 132).

and ideological distortion with recourse to moral norms, because the appropriate target of the criticism is the *whole* ideological framework of a given mode of production.17

## *Dignity and Social Practice*

There is, however, another important aspect that sheds light on Marx's reaction to Heinzen's use of the concept of dignity. Focusing on the prevailing Kantian understanding of dignity can help explain this. To anticipate, Marx's rejection of moral terms can at least partly be understood as expressing a disapproval of what Michael Rosen calls Kant's "Platonism" about morality.18

In the *Groundwork* Kant unfolds his view on dignity arguing that in the kingdom of ends, there are entities that have a price (and can hence be replaced by something else), and entities that have dignity (and hence admitting of no equivalent). The latter have "an intrinsic value, that is dignity…. Hence morality, and humanity insofar as it is capable of morality, is the only thing which has dignity."19 Put in different terms, while laws determine the conditions under which something can count as a value, "The law-making which determines all value must for this reason have a dignity—that is, an unconditioned and incomparable worth."20 Dignity is thus the ground of human nature's unconditional, incomparable value that all human beings possess. As carriers of the moral law within themselves, human beings are somehow lifted beyond the natural world, and dignity is depicted as sublimity

<sup>17</sup> Consistently, Marx does not maintain that communism would be a just form of society, and he denies that capitalist exploitation is intelligible as injustice or the violation of certain rights.

(*Erhabenheit*), which is the highest elevation.21 Importantly, in contrast to things with a derived value determined by the market forces of supply and demand (that lastly derive from human goals), "dignity" is incomparable and *nonderived*. 22

From Marx's point of view, this view is both suspect and fundamentally misguided. The main reason is that such an account mistakenly conceives of moral value as deriving from outside of history and the social practices of a community. Marx thinks that one should resist any moral concept or principle *that is conceived independently of the ruling economic relations.* Such moral vocabulary, if presented as stemming a priori from laws of reason, masks the real basis of its norms, which are historically contingent social forms. It is on such background that he claims that any social criticism based on concepts like "dignity" is not only mistaken and deemed to be ineffective, but also demonstrates an uncritical and superficial intellectual attitude that "takes refuge from history in morality."

## Conclusion

Marx's outlook on morality and dignity is a complex and controversial issue that is often portrayed fairly unsophisticatedly. Some of the confusion can be traced directly back to Marx's ambiguous formulations, but some of it is simply expressive of the fact that Marx hasn't provided a full and systematic account

<sup>21</sup> Oliver Sensen provides a different interpretation of "dignity" in Kant, arguing that Kant to a certain extent actually relies on a Stoic conception. See Oliver Sensen, "Kant's Conception of Human Dignity," *Kant-Studien* 100 (2009): 309–31; Oliver Sensen, *Kant on Human Dignity* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2011), and Senen's contribution to this volume. His point is that contrary to what the most well-known passages suggest, Kant does not think of dignity as an inner value, but merely as the elevation of something over something else. In other words, "dignity" is the relational property of being elevated.

<sup>22</sup> This might at first appear puzzling since Kant posits a strong link between the capacity for morality and dignity and simultaneously maintains that the moral nature of human beings comes from our having been created by God as free beings. However, Rosen rightly notes that Kant's account of dignity doesn't depend on God, as it did in Aquinas. In fact, Kant allows that we can know moral nature independently of our beliefs about God and takes thus steps toward a secular understanding of dignity (Rosen, *Dignity*, 24–25).

of the normative standards that are inherent in his criticism. Shedding more light on Marx's uncompromising view and the tension between Marx's positive and negative views on human dignity, this contribution briefly investigated the status of moral terms like dignity within historical materialism, contrasting it with the Kantian understanding of dignity. The discussion presented here remained neutral on the question whether Marx's criticism succeeds, or whether it is inconsistent with the main credos of historical materialism.23

<sup>23</sup> Marx offers a powerful criticism of moral concepts by providing a historical materialist analysis, but provides no systematic account of the normative fundament of his criticism. However, it is debatable to what extent we should think of this strategy as failed. If Marx is right in at least some cases about the functional role of morality, then any form of social criticism guided by traditional moral terms has at least to take his criticism into account.
