# Chapter 4: Islamic Conceptions of Dignity Historical Trajectories and Paradigms

*Mustafa Shah*

The avid attention devoted to law in the early and medieval historical periods of Islamic scholarship, together with the sheer volume of literature this endeavor produced, might by itself seem to justify the view that Islam, in its classical expression, was predominantly a religion of law.1 But the more important fact to register is that within the Islamic tradition, theoretically, a perfect distinction is not drawn between the realm of the spiritual and the realm of the temporal when it comes to legislation of law: the field of law, or Sharīʿah, focuses on the systematic regulation of *all* aspects of human conduct and interaction.2 Within this context, classical legal discourses included detailed expositions of

issues ranging from political governance and administration to commerce and family law, which featured alongside equally rigorous treatments of ritual topics, including the formalities of ablution, prayer, alms payment, fasting, rites of pilgrimage, dietary regulations, and even dress code.3 But legal issues were also a salient feature of theological deliberations, wherein the juridical import of topics such as autonomy, morality, divine justice, theodicy, deserts, and causality was fleshed out with regards to normative human conduct. Even Islamic ethicists, who examined morality within the context of the pursuit of human refinement, adduced materials synoptically distilled from traditional scriptural sources and wisdom literature that complemented the already burgeoning corpus of legalistic literature and materials.4

Given the sheer breadth and scale of Islamic legal thought and the variety of its formats, it is unsurprising that discussions relevant to conceptions of dignity do feature prominently among its discourses.5 Indeed, across the broad range of legal, theological, and ethical literature one does find subtle references to topics such as honor, rank, station, self-esteem, respect, integrity, inalienable worth, and gravitas broached from a fascinating gamut of perspectives and standpoints. With a view to exploring understandings of dignity in classical Islamic thought, this chapter will set out to trace the historical background

<sup>3</sup> Also significant is the rapid spread of the Islamic conquests: within thirty-years of the Prophet's death, large swathes of the Near and Middle East, previously under the control of the Byzantine and Persian empires, were now under Islamic rule; and the conquests spread to the Caucasus, parts of Central Asia, India, and North Africa.

Debes does point out that studies are axiomatic in claiming that "dignity is beset by ambiguity in use." He also argues that those who claim that the concept's being "messy" and "hard to define" is indicative of its "fundamental character" overlook that this might be construed by some as confirming its "inscrutable" nature; and that a "conscientious *metatheory* about what dignity is, might remedy the manifest ambiguity in how we talk about it." Debes notes that discussions are "dominated by the Kantian and Judeo-Christian traditions that make dignity a function of, respectively, rational autonomy or spiritual identity with God (*imago Dei*)," although in his survey no mention is made of the Islamic perspectives.

and development of the various discussions, situating their relevance within the vector of current western academic surveys of the concept of dignity.6 Significantly, this will allow a broader gauging of their relevance to current debates on the challenges of modernity and reform in Islam, within which the concept of dignity is often invoked.

Interestingly, the immense interest that discourses on dignity have attracted recently across a range of fields and areas, including political, legal, theological, philosophical, anthropological, and bioethical treatments of the subject, has extended to include surveys in which Islamic perspectives on dignity relative to those fields and strands of thought have been gauged.7 The number of these studies is steadily increasing and includes surveys of the subject based solely on the jurisprudential aspects of the discussions, and those that seek to explore conceptions of dignity with historical reference to classical theological and ethical discourses.8 While it is often assumed that classical Islamic treatments of the subject of dignity were derivative, showing neither resourcefulness

nor originality, it will be shown that such conclusions were reached on the basis of a narrow focus on confined aspects of the relevant literature without taking into consideration the holistic dynamic through which classical writers were able to broach the subject with reference to legal, theological, and ethical perspectives. Moreover, the range of approaches to the subject demonstrates the sheer potential of the sources and the fact that within them a broad range of standpoints is accommodated.

It should be noted that from a historiographical perspective the traditional narratives of early Islam are the subject of much debate in terms of their authenticity. This is due to the paucity of the source materials from these early periods; indeed, it is mostly through later literary texts that early materials are preserved.9 Still, this in no way impinges upon the intellectual fecundity and literary value of the extant sources. It simply hinders attempts to date the historical genesis of the beliefs and doctrines that were later defined as being characteristic of authentic expressions of the faith. Moreover, the wealth of literary materials produced during the first three centuries of the Islamic tradition serves as distinct testimony to its intellectual achievements. Highly sophisticated traditions of learning had already developed at the end of the ninth century ce, with impressive literary works being produced across a range of areas including law, theology, exegesis, grammar, philology, history, and biography. Notwithstanding scholarship in the religious disciplines, a rich tradition of study in the natural philosophical sciences developed.10 This golden age of learning and

erudition was followed by equally prolific achievements in scholarship during the later medieval periods. Scholars of this subsequent era were not vapidly replicating earlier discussions, but rather augmenting and evolving the intellectual scholarship bequeathed to them, rendering it relevant to new challenges and encounters.

## Historical Context of the Faith and Its Sources

With due emphasis placed on the importance of tradition and precedent, Islamic legal rulings and doctrinal teachings are essentially linked to two scriptural sources: the Qur'an and the Prophetic Sunna (normative custom).11 Divided among 114 chapters of varying length, the Qur'an comprises over six thousand verses covering theological, legal, ethical, and eschatological themes. Traditional sources intimate that the Qur'an was revealed piecemeal over a twenty-twoyear period between 610 ce and 632 ce Chronologically, revelation associated with the early years of the Prophet's career at Mecca tended to evoke theological and ethical themes, while following the migration to Medina, which was designated the start of the Muslim calendar (622 ce), these were augmented with materials of a distinctly legal countenance. This was a reflection of the change in the fortunes of the nascent Muslim community: adherents of the faith were largely persecuted at Mecca, while at Medina they were permitted to practice their faith and share in the political process; Qur'anic

<sup>11</sup> The concept of Sunna did have a pre-Islamic provenance, personifying all that was principled in ancient tribal custom and practice. The traditional chronology surrounding the concept of the Prophetic Sunna and its genesis are disputed in modern scholarship: the emergence of Sunnism from a proto-religious movement is viewed as being conveniently glossed over in the traditional Islamic sources. Yet debates and arguments about the historical emergence of the Sunna and the origins of *ḥadīths* are actually academic, in the loose sense of the word, for the simple reason that for classical scholarship these sources provided the materials for the articulation of legal thought.

revelation from the latter period frequently engages with the change of circumstances.

Significantly, Islam does not present itself as a distinctively new religious faith but one that openly shares a common prophetic and scriptural heritage with the religions of Judaism and Christianity; its message is one of revival and restoration.12 Islam presents the figure of Muhammad as one of a long line of divinely appointed messengers, all of whom promulgated monotheistic teachings, and some were recipients of scripture. Thus, while the Qur'an is extolled as a revealed text, so too are the Hebrew Scriptures and the Gospels. Jews and Christians are referred to by the Qur'an as the *ahl alkitāb* (people of divinely revealed scripture); the Qur'an frequently states that it was "confirming what had been revealed previously" (Q. 5:50), adding, "Dispute not with the People of the Book, except with reverence, save those who grossly err, and say to them: 'We accept what has been revealed to us and what has been revealed to you; indeed our God and your God is one and to him we submit'" (Q. 29:45).13 Notwithstanding the fact that there exist doctrinal divergences between Islam and its monotheistic sister faiths, this qualification does not attenuate Islam's view of the sacrosanct nature of the original scriptures. From a legal perspective, the status of these communities is connected to this fact. Theoretically, there existed a restricted sense in which the prescriptions of the Sharīʿa, in terms of obligations and responsibilities, were applied to such communities as confirmed by historical anecdotes, such as: "With regards to the protected peoples, matters germane to rights, transactions and inheritance should be delegated to their co-religionists,

<sup>12</sup> It is frequently assumed that Qur'anic materials were digressions from a body of normative materials or perfunctorily distilled from a miscellany of traditional and apocryphal biblical sources; however, there is an internal dynamic that prefigures the Qur'an's treatment of personalities and themes; common sources are shared, but attitudes and approaches to figures and ideas differ entirely.

<sup>13</sup> Variations are explained by classical Islamic scholars as resulting from either alterations or distortions of the contents of the original message.

unless they desire otherwise."14 Furthermore, the Qur'an states, "If they come to you (the Prophet) seeking your judgment, then offer it imparting justice." It then moves on to comment, "Why should they seek your arbitration when they have in their possession the Torah and the Gospels?" (Q. 5:43).15

Although from a hierarchical perspective the Qur'an serves as the preeminent source of counsel, its legal directives were frequently expounded upon through reference to the Prophetic Sunna, which was later preserved within the body of materials referred to as the traditions or *ḥadīth*s.16 The inference is that in his lifetime the Prophet clarified and given context to the teachings enshrined within the Qur'an, bestowing an all-encompassing code of practice that his followers and later generations of adherents were entreated to emulate.17

The traditional view is this "living custom" was safeguarded for posterity in the years following the Prophet's death and eventually preserved and transmitted through a variety of oral and written means. There exist hundreds of thousands of *ḥadīths*, and using methods of criticism based on the scrutiny of their intricate chains of transmission, scholars in the ninth and tenth centuries

He remarks that "the Islamic legal treatment of non-Muslims is symptomatic of the more general challenge of governing a diverse polity," concluding at the same time that "the pursuit of pluralism through the institutions of law and governance is a messy business." The term *dhimmī* is linked to notions of protection.

<sup>16</sup> A *ḥadīth* is made up of two components: the *matn* (the actual text or account of what is being transmitted on the authority of the Prophet); and its *isnād* (support or chain of transmission).

<sup>17</sup> It is argued that far from representing authentic records of the early years of Islam, these *ḥadīth*s were subjective attempts to project an idealized and impressionistic portrayal of early Islam.

ce identified a core of materials that essentially furnished the "raw materials" used for the formulation of the practices and teachings associated with ritual and law. Much of the scholarly activity of the eighth and ninth centuries ce was symbolized by a quest to reconstruct the exemplar of the Prophetic Sunna through circumspect reference to the constellation of materials derived from the Qur'an and the Hadīth. The collation, codification, and interpretation of these data represented one of the defining features of scholarship in these early periods.18 Decisively, this scholarship sustained the juridical and associated scholarship of later medieval periods.19 Indeed, today classical materials are not obsolete relics from the past but continue to influence legal discourses and deliberations in the Arab and Islamic world.20

Over the course of Islamic history four schools of jurisprudence came to dominate legal thought: the eponymously formed Ḥanafī, Mālikī, Shāfi'ī, and Ḥanbalī traditions of thought, which are all associated with the Sunni branch of Islam.21 Despite the fact that there has been a tendency to view Islamic law as being immutable, the inherent depth and variety of the sources permitted flexibility in the interpretation of juridical points and perspectives, allowing a fostering of different understandings of the law across a range of issues. Schools of scholastic theology also flourished and were ideologically linked with the legal schools. While adopting a different set of hierarchical principles and paradigms, the Shia schools anchored their heritage to the

<sup>20</sup> In the formative periods jurists developed principles for the synthesis and systematization of the sources of law with reference to the Qur'an and the *ḥadīths*, using earlier conventions and precedents as analogues to refine legal concepts such as analogical reasoning (*qiyās*) and community consensus (*ijmāʿ*). Through a process of deduction, *qiyās* allowed jurists to extend the finite body of sources to deal with unprecedented points of law.

teaching of their imams (designated spiritual leaders), developing their own schools of thought.22

## Foundations and Paradigms

While the origin of the concept of dignity in Judeo-Christian religious discourses is historically linked with the basic notion that man was created in the image of God (*imago Dei*), Islamic teachings are typically viewed as originating in the various Qur'anic dicta in which frequent direct references and allusions are made to the revered status of humankind. Incidentally, the Qur'an is categorical in stressing the incomparable nature of the divine essence, proclaiming, "Nothing exists which can compare to Him and He is the all hearing the all seeing" (Q. 42:11). Indeed, in the view of rational theologians, the fact that God is an utterly transcendent being militates against the invocation of an anthropomorphic analogue between the creator and the created; so the notion of *imago Dei* is something that rational Islamic theologians rejected.23 However, it has been suggested that initially a number of eighth century ce *ḥadīth* specialists did invoke dicta that made mention of the term *imago Dei.* The suggestion is that as antianthropomorphic views held sway among certain scholars, such reports were shunned, especially in exegetical literature and by rational theologians who were uncomfortable with the literal connotations of man being created in the image of God, although *ḥadīth* scholars did continue to uphold their veracity. Nevertheless, although these reports

<sup>22</sup> Differences between Sunni and Shia expressions of Islam turned on the issue of the leadership of the community: within Shiism the view was that the leadership of the community was divinely determined and it was the exclusive dominion of the members of the house of the Prophet. Offshoots from Shiism include the Ismāʿīlīs and Zaydīs.

<sup>23</sup> See Christopher Melchert, "God Created Adam in His Image," *Journal of Qur'anic Studies* 13, no. 1 (2011): 113–24. Theologians of a rationalist persuasion tended to favor a view that God's creating man in his form should be understood in the abstract sense of commensurate with fine qualities embodied by God's attributes and not implying any physical correlation. Cf. Yair Lorberbaum, "Human Dignity in the Jewish Tradition," in Düwell et al., *Handbook of Human Dignity*, 135–44; and McCrudden, "Pursuit of Human Dignity," 28–33.

may have been in vogue, they were never made the raison d'être of the concept of dignity, nor did they form part of a unified attempt to articulate ideas connected with this notion. The closest one gets to a correlation is the fact that in one of the versions of the *imago Dei ḥadīths*, reference is made to the Prophet's discouraging the striking of one's brother on the face on account of his being created in the image of God.24 This was sometimes explained in terms of underscoring the respect accorded to humans as God's creation; a further connection to this idea is provided by the Qur'anic verse that speaks of God's creating Adam using his own "hands" (Q. 38:75): again, it was cited to illustrate the high esteem in which humans were held by God.25 Certainly, the Qur'an's overall message is one of salvation and within this context the concern for human dignity is not only presented as a given within the text, but it is intricately anchored to notions of divine imperative and command.

In the classical sources the essential idea of man's dignity in the sense of his honor (*karāma*), prestige (ʿ*izz*), sanctity (*ḥurma*), inherent status and rank (*manzila*), and his inalienable worth (*qīma*) is not attributed to a single Qur'anic verse or theme but features in recurring motifs across various verses and exempla.26 Specific verses quoted in support of broader conceptions of the elevated status and dignity of humankind included "Verily we have bestowed honour upon the sons of Adam and facilitated their travel over land and sea, granting them all things good and fine; likewise, we have granted exceptional preference to them over much of our creation"

<sup>24</sup> Rational theologians did attempt to obviate the anthropomorphic import of such traditions.

<sup>25</sup> Those of a rationalist inclination paraphrased the word "hands" with "grace." The debates between medieval rationalist and traditionalist theologians on the literal contra metaphorical implications of the discussions are heated. The former favored the use of dialectical arguments and strategies, while the latter were apprehensive about their employment, rejecting the use of metaphor to explain away language that is found on the Qur'an.

<sup>26</sup> Other Arabic terms used include *jāh* (repute) and *iḥtirām* (respect and veneration). One does need to bear in mind that the Qur'an is essentially liturgical in its format and that its narratives are often allusive.

(Q. 17:70).27 In the verse the all-encompassing nature of this act of bestowing "honor," or *karam*, upon mankind appears unassailable and can be linked to the notion of the unearned worth of humans. Some classical commentators speculatively drew a correlation between the elevated status of humankind and the fact that humans were rational and sentient beings; others referred to man's unique physical features as constituting markers of his status.28 More significantly, specific verses such as Q. 2:30 heralded man's preeminence and rank among creation, referring to his being made a vicegerent on earth to whom the angels were commanded to prostrate; by the same token, verses such as Q. 95:4 declared that "man was created with the finest of constitutions," confirming the Qur'anic view of humankind's uniqueness among creation. Likewise, primacy granted to the welfare and well-being of humans is justified by verses such as Q. 45:13, in which it is stated, "He subjected all that is in the heavens and earth for your [man's] benefit." Despite their general semantic sweep, the aforementioned Qur'anic statements would have formed the substrate for discussions across a constellation of legal issues and perspectives in which the inalienable worth of humans is an overriding consideration and brought to bear on the interpretation and application of the law.29

Alongside the Qur'an, the material of the Prophetic traditions played a salient role in shaping the articulation of legal thought with standpoints on law and theology defined through the concomitant reference to these sources. In the corpora of the *ḥadīth*s there exists a phenomenal amount of materials on the sanctity of life, equality,

modesty, the rights of fellow human beings, rank, gravitas, kindness, acts of charity, courteousness, and honor, all of which presuppose an understanding of concepts and constructs associated with the innate worth not only of mankind but all of creation. Significantly, the classical literary texts in which Prophetic traditions were collated and authenticated included within them lengthy chapters devoted to *adab* (etiquette) in which moral rectitude and accountability are encouraged across a range of areas that intersect with key themes found in the discourses on dignity.30

## Ethical Literature and Thought

The genesis of ethical and protreptic literature confirms the sophistication with which classical scholarship developed ideas on the notion of the innate worth of individuals and egalitarianism. Taking their

<sup>30</sup> These include *ḥadīth*s such as "An Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab; nor a non-Arab over an Arab except by virtue of piety; you are all (the offspring of ) Adam and he was (created) from clay." It also includes statements that denounce the killing of non-Muslims, such as "He who takes the life of a protected person will never savour the scent of paradise"; as well as traditions that mandate that the dead be treated with respect and dignity, such as "The fracturing (or breaking) of a dead person's bones is akin to the violation of a living person"; and that refer to the rights of neighbors: "Whoever believes in God and the Day of Judgement, must not harm his neighbour." But this is not the limit of respect. On the contrary, the notion of respect for *all* creation is enshrined in a variety of traditions such as the recounting of the parable of a man on a journey who, overcome by thirst, descends into a well to quench it. Having done so, he continues his journey and comes across a panting dog so overwhelmed by thirst that he is "licking" the soil. Pitying the dog, he slips off his leather "sock" and descends once more into the well, filling it with water before climbing out with his sock clasped between his teeth, proceeding to quench the dog's thirst. The tradition ends with mention of God's having shown gratitude to this individual, pardoning him for his sins, to which the companions of the Prophet declared: "Are we rewarded (for acts of kindness) to animals?" The Prophet replied with an emphatic yes! Indeed, there are numerous traditions that inveigh against the abuse of any living creature, condemning blood sports, the degradation of animals for pleasure, and their confinement to cages; and mandating that they be spared from suffering if they are slaughtered. (Interestingly, the Kantian position posits that "as far as animals are concerned, we have no direct duties" and that they are a means to an end, while the Islamic position is one that grants that they should not be treated as a means. Of course, Kant does argue that man is obliged to desist from the punishment or illtreatment of animals.) There are even traditions that denounce the gratuitous destruction of trees. See the *ḥadīth* collections of al-Bukhārī (d. 870), Muslim (d. 875), Abū Dāwūd (d. 888), al-Nasāʾī (d. 915), al-Tirmidhī (d. 892), and Ibn Mājah (d. 886). Bukhārī was the author of one of Sunni orthodoxy's most renowned compendium of traditions. The "refinements of morality" tradition features in the major collections.

cue from general Qur'anic statements and select teachings from the Prophetic traditions, ethicists evolved literary genres that aesthetically probed a range of topics and themes connected with conceptions of dignity. Such works appeared under the rubric of *kutub al-ādāb wa'lakhlāq* (the books of etiquette and morals) and perfected an appealingly unpretentious way of engaging with ideals that celebrated moral conduct, decency, and respect for all. These works were not working independently of the traditional sources but feeding off the general tenor of their standpoints on the rectitude of morality, especially as the Prophet was reported to have pronounced that he "was sent to perfect the refinements of morality."

The genre of ethical writings attracted an eclectic range of approaches, providing a fecund framework for the synthesis of ideas. Among the early works is the *Kitāb Makārim al-akhlāq* (The Book of Moral Qualities) composed by Ibn Abī'l-Dunyā (d. 894).31 He eschewed non-Islamic materials, but later medieval writers who produced works in the field of *ādāb* (etiquette) and *akhlāq* (morals) certainly adduced Greek, Persian, and Indian wisdom teachings, fusing them with materials derived from traditional sources. The brand of humanistic ideas defined as "normative secular ethics" is to found in the writings of Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (d. 1033) and Miskawayhi (d. 1030).32 Al-Tawḥīdī produced an impressive array of treatises on subjects ranging from works on friendship and morality to texts that debated philosophy and skepticism. Making innovative use of an eclectic selection of sources such as the Qur'an, the traditions, and Aristotle's *Nicomachean Ethics*, he was able to produce inspired treatments of topics in which themes such as freedom of expression, respect, virtue, honor, grace,

veneration for humans, and morality were extolled as essential qualities. Commending not only their aesthetic merits, Tawḥīdī set about identifying their functional relevance in ways which revealed a fortiori their compatibility with the spirit of the teachings of the religious tradition. The aim in such texts is to work toward defining an allencompassing moral code that intersects with religious values, showing an appreciation of the quest that humans shared a common destiny.

The work of Miskawayhi reflects the vitality of the genre of ethical writing and has been described by one recent author as providing a framework for "critical appropriation" and "integration," allowing "individuality, creativity, tolerance, freedom of choice and benevolence to thrive."33 Miskawayhi composed both the *Tahdhīb al-akhlāq* (The Refinement of Morals) and the seminal *Tartīb al-sa*ʿ*ādāt* (Preparation for Happiness).34 His works emphasize the importance of the individual and the pursuit of his refinement, fostering ideas that do resonate in the discourses associated with dignity. Miskawayhi influenced the thought of Ghazālī (d. 1111), whose contributions to Islamic intellectual discourses were immense.35 He was able to assimilate Miskawayhi's general synthesis of ethical and mystical paradigms in his own works such as the *Iḥyāʾ* '*ulūm al-dīn* (Revivification of the Religious Sciences) and other key treatises; and it is the theme of human refinement

and perfection of conduct that resonates in the work. The traces of Miskawayhi's thought are also found in the celebrated work on ethics entitled *Akhlāq-i Nāṣirī*, composed by the Persian philosopher and astronomer Naṣīr al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī (d. 1274). Incidentally, it has been noted that he anticipated aspects of Kant's notion of the categorical imperative "by over five centuries" when he asserted "that an act was authentically moral only in terms of the intention that accompanies it, unsullied by self-interest or mock virtues."36 The mystical tradition provided a rich spiritual environment within which themes of human perfection and refinement were enthused with theosophical ideas; therein the commitment to moral decency together with respect for others was considered quintessential.37

Of particular interest with regards to the theoretical dimensions of arguments about morality is the influence of the theological movement known as the Muʿtazila, whose earliest proponents were active in the eighth century ce. Espousing a distinctive brand of rational theology and dialectics, and influenced by Greek philosophical and logical ideas, the Muʿtazila advocated deference to the primacy of reason as the sole arbiter of truth.

The work of the mystic Abū Ṭālib al-Makkī (d. 386/966) provides an excellent template for the synthesis of legal, ethical, and mystical paradigms and within which the notion of the dignity is linked to personal piety and refinement.

just, they also dismissed exclusively fideistic approaches to doctrine. Within this schema, it was postulated that God always acts in consonance with the dictates of reason. Ex hypothesi, qualities that determine the nature of either good or evil had to be discerned through objective rational enquiry, in the sense that "justice and goodness have a real existence."38 Citing rational proofs, they disavowed the doctrine of predestination, explaining that divine justice predicates that man must be a free and responsible agent. And their theologians excoriated attempts to describe the divine essence through reference to crude anthropomorphism, insisting that God was utterly transcendent.

There was a countermovement to the Muʿtazila led by a former adherent of the school, al-Ashʿarī (d. 935), who developed a synthesis of orthodox doctrine steeped in rationalism but who supported the doctrine of predestination, articulating it in ways that made man an agent through a theory of acquisition, thereby preserving the notion of divine omnipotence. Ashʿarī theologians rejected the Muʿtazila's thesis that God's actions were governed by the same ethical standards to which humans were expected to adhere, dismissing it as being a presumptuous imposition on the divine being. Dismissing the Muʿtazilī deontological framework, they adopted what has been described as "voluntaristic occasionalism" or "theistic subjectivism," believing that "ethical valuations of actions are grounded neither in the acts themselves nor in their properties."39 According to the Ashʿarī position, the ontology of an act in terms of its being either morally reprehensible or good was determined by divine revelation. However, there is no suggestion that Ashʿarī notions of the significance of dignity and morality

were compromised by such abstract postulates. In the Muʿtazilī view respect for the autonomy of individuals and their inherent worth issued from the school's conception of divine justice, which would make no sense if individuals were not able to exercise choice. Even the idea of rewards and punishments in the hereafter was premised on a rigorous epistemology of human free will. Muʿtazilī abstraction in this regards was not an exercise in grounding personal rights in a philosophical sense, but using the idea of free will and responsibility to interpret key theological and legal paradigms.

There were scholars who preferred to configure their digests of morality and etiquette primarily around the conventional scriptural sources, and this was certainly true of jurists associated with the Ḥanbalī school. The work of Ibn Mufliḥ (d. 1362) entitled *al-Ādāb al-shar*ʿ*iyya* (Traditionalist Ethics) exemplifies this approach. In the introduction he explains that the book comprises materials on etiquette that all should aspire to understand and discharge. Undeniably, the work adopts a somewhat sedate and formal approach, accentuating individual effort in the refinement of character, but themes associated with dignity interweave throughout the discussions. This emphasis on good character and the treatment of others with due respect is no surprise given that there exists a Prophetic dictum stating, "Nothing bears more upon the scales of justice than the rectitude of character." Even scholars renowned for their substantive contribution to legal theory and thought were actively involved in composing treatises that pored over the merits of the pursuit of moral rectitude and ethical justice, a fact that confirms the variety of approaches to ethics and morality countenanced within the Islamic tradition: the Andalusian scholar Ibn Ḥazm (d. 1064) and the Iraqi jurist al-Māwardī (d. 1058) were both authors of such works. The former composed *Kitāb al-akhlāq wa'l-siyar* (The Book of Morality and Demeanor); the latter authored the *Adab al-dunyā wa'l-dīn* (Temporal and Spiritual Ethics). At the other end of the spectrum, within the field of philosophy, individuals such as al-Kindī (d. 870), Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (d. 925), al-Fārābī (d. 950), Ibn Sīnā (d. 1037), Ibn Rushd (d. 1198), and Fakhr al-Dīn al-Rāzī (d. 1209) had already made enormous strides in conceiving highly intellectualist syntheses of ethics and justice that promoted the idea of dignity and rights.40 Certainly, the observation has been made that "the Qur'an did not attempt to regulate every detail of life in the ways worked out by the traditional law school" and that "it permitted and encouraged independent ethical thinking," and this is evidenced by the attention devoted to *adab* literature by classical Islamic theologians, jurists, and philosophers.41

## Engaging with the Discourse of Dignity

To appreciate the underlying legal, theological, and ethical thrust of Qur'anic legislation and teachings, one does need to bear in mind the historical contexts in which they were principally set. Traditional accounts present pre-Islamic beliefs and practices as embodying an aberration from primitive monotheism; they intimate that the pre-Islamic Arabs perverted not only the rites and beliefs associated with expressions of monotheism to which the Qur'an was advocating a return, but also created a society in which inequality, discrimination, oppression, and subjugation of the weak were allowed to fester.42 In the pre-Islamic milieu lineage and pedigree were considered key

<sup>42</sup> Mecca was dominated by tribes and clans who wielded considerable powers. Generosity and protection of the weak were lauded as significant values in pre-Islamic poetry. There are suggestions that the Islamic sources inflated the negative aspects of pre-Islamic Arabia, although key elements of the narrative of the Qur'an are predicated on their railing against the Meccan milieu and its inclination to idolatry.

indicators of honor, prestige, and rank. This status quo is challenged at many junctures in the Qur'an, although perhaps the most significant pericope that taps into the Qur'anic position is the verse that states, "Oh mankind, we have created you from male and female, establishing you into peoples and tribes that you may know one another. Verily, in God's sight, the most noble of you is he who is most pious" (Q. 49:13). Evidently, such statements had far-reaching implications, as they radically challenged societal norms and mores, dismissing the relevance of pedigree and wealth as markers of status.43 The semantics of this verse appear to turn not on the advocacy of gradations of status on the basis of piety, which is ultimately an interior quality and not requisite in any legal sense, but rather on its predicating the dignified status of humans and their worth, advocating a "leveling up" in the treatment of others.44 In Islam the pre-Islamic ideals of *ḥasab* (pedigree) and *nasab* (lineage) did retain their symbolic importance as paradigms of merit and excellence, but from a more general perspective of the law, these ideals had little impact with regards to rights and privileges, although genealogical qualification did become a prerequisite for caliphal office.45

<sup>43</sup> According to Adam Smith (d. 1790), the idea of dignity was tied to "expressions of social rank or the virtue of self-command and thus never refers directly to the inherent value of persons as it often does in contemporary theory." See Remy Debes, "Adam Smith on Dignity and Equality," *British Journal for the History of Philosophy* 20, no. 1 (2012): 110.

<sup>44</sup> Cf. Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 144. In Waldron's thesis dignity is anchored to notions of honor and the relationship with status.

<sup>45</sup> Some traditions state that ethnicity should not be a factor in selecting the leader of a community. With regards to the leadership of the community, the Khārijites, a religio-political movement in early Islam, rejected the qualification of *nasab*, arguing that personal merit trumped lineage. In his seminal collection of Prophetic traditions the compiler Abū Dawūd al-Sijistānī included a section on the balefulness of "Boasting of One's Ancestry." Among the traditions included in the section is a dictum that pronounces to the Arabs, "God has saved you from the conceit of the period of ignorance in which boasting of one's genealogy prevailed: (among you is) the virtuous believer and the impiously wicked, yet you are all the sons of Adam and Adam was created from clay." Likewise, the innate worth of all humans is alluded to in a tradition included in al-Bukhārī's collection in the section devoted to funeral prayers. There it is recounted that the Prophet was asked why he had stood up to pay his respect to a passing funeral cortège as the deceased was a Jew and not from the Muslim faith; his response was "Is this not a soul?"

Significantly, the very idea of upholding justice and righteousness in the treatment of others is lucidly encapsulated in the Qur'an verse that declares, "God decrees that that you act with justness and benevolence, showing kindness to kith and kin; and that you refrain from acts of indecency, repugnance, and dishonour" (Q. 16:90); and "Oh you who truly believe, be just and bear witness to God, even if it against yourselves, your parents or indeed those very close to you" (Q. 4:135). It is belief in the equal rank of humans and respect for others to which the verse, together with the Qur'an's ideas about social justice, ultimately alludes; and the implication is that such verses censure the treatment of individuals as objects, while encouraging impartiality, honorableness, and fairness.46 In this regard, the dignity of individuals lies in their being protected from degradation and contempt.47

Interestingly, although working with a very a confined pool of materials and glossing over the elaborateness of expressions of dignity within the classical Islamic tradition, Miklós Maróth has argued that the scriptural sources give the impression that "there is an inequality in respect of human dignity between Muslims and non-Muslims, between owners of a sacred book and between members of all other religious communities." He concludes that, because dignity is God's gift to mankind, it is seemingly confined to all those "persons who live according to his commandments."48 He does accept that "other people's dignity" would be respected by those who link it to acting piously.

<sup>46</sup> Waldron, referring to Gregory Vlastos's essay on justice and equality, does make a cogent point about the idea of nobility and rank being exploited to elevate all through transvaluation; and one wonders whether the Islamic focus on the quality of piety, and even encouraging the pursuit of knowledge, anticipates that line of enquiry. See Waldron, *Dignity, Rank, and Rights*, 35f. The Qur'an and the Prophetic traditions consistently laud the pursuit of knowledge, intimating a higher rank is accorded to those who are learned, but the function of such statements is chiefly paraenetic.

Reading the same range of scriptural sources, others have asserted that rights are issued through "sovereign favour," but there is no indication that they are exclusive. Indeed, Mohammad Kamali has made the case that verses such as Q. 17:70 provided unqualified affirmation of the universal nature of man's dignity. He quoted the nineteenth-century Qur'an commentator al-Alusī, whose view was that the verse in question intimates that "everyone and all members of the human race, including the pious and the sinner, are endowed with dignity, nobility and honor."49 Kamali added that dignity is not earned by "meritorious conduct" but "is an expression of God's favour and grace" and that on that basis "it is not permissible to violate the personal dignity of anyone, regardless of whether the person is pious or of ill-repute, Muslim or non-Muslim."50 This posits that human dignity, rights, and respect for others are irrevocably extended to those who are not adherents of the faith.

In her study of hierarchy in early Islamic society Louise Marlow did suggest that "Islam is probably the most uncompromising of the world's religions in its insistence on the equality of all believers before God."51 Yet she did make the case that despite the Qur'an's advocating that "inequalities have no bearing on an individual's moral worth and ultimate fate in the next world," the Qur'an "endorses several forms of worldly inequality," including its "acceptance of slavery and the social superiority of men over women."52 Marlow does adduce a number of verses that, it is argued, show apparent inconsistencies in the Qur'anic position on equality. For example Q. 43:32: "And that God has raised

<sup>51</sup> Louise Marlow, *Hierarchy and Egalitarianism in Islamic Thought* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), xi. Marlow's point from a broader historical perspective is that while the Qur'an advocated a profoundly egalitarian ethic that enjoyed hegemony within the early centuries of Islamic political rule, paradoxically, it was seemingly eclipsed in later political discourses as stratification and the focus on class did become rife in successive historical periods: it dominated the construction of social models.

some over others in terms of rank, so that some may take others in servitude"; and Q. 17:21: "Behold how we favoured some of them over others, and the next world will be greater in degrees and greater in favour." However, a closer reading of these verses reveals that they are not marking rank or hierarchy through favor, but referring to providence and the human condition; in strictly legal terms there is nothing within them that would impinge upon approaches to the legal issues of rights and obligations. Historians of Islamic law tend to point out that "Islam conferred rights on women in the seventh century that women in the West were unable to obtain until relatively recent times" and that "Qur'anic innovations tend in the direction of enhancing women's rights and elevating their status and dignity."53 Still, while such a state of affairs might be considered a milestone from an historical context, the question remains: within the confines of the Qur'anic framework, with its supposed accent on egalitarianism and improvement, to what extent is an "inferior status" accorded to women in Islam, and how can this be reconciled with the modern concept of dignity that is grounded in the idea of equality and the inalienable rights of individuals and their innate worth?54

The historical picture painted by the traditional Islamic sources with regards to the status of women in pre-Islamic Arabia is a dismal one. It has become clichéd to state that the pursuit of reform, amelioration,

and social justice appears to be the principal drivers behind Qur'anic legal injunctions, which are set against the backdrop of countering attitudes deleterious to women prevalent in pre-Islamic society, but a cursory review of most of the Qur'anic legislation on women, and indeed other core social issues, does lend support to that view.55 Examples of amelioration include the condemnation of female infanticide and egregious abuses with regards to marriage, divorce, defamation, and inheritance.56 Still, two interesting issues that are flagged in the discussions about the Qur'an and its attitude to women concern the subject of testimony and inheritance: the Qur'an does stipulate that for the purpose of testimony two male witnesses are required; however, in the event of there being only a single male witness available, then two women may be called upon to bear witness in place of the male (Q. 2:282). On the division of inheritance, the Qur'an rules that a male should receive twice the portion awarded to women (Q. 4:176); and there are also verses that seemingly "elevate" men in terms of responsibilities (Q. 4:34).57

Explanations of the Qur'anic position reason that these distinctions were a reflection of the greater economic responsibility assumed by

Jackson highlights Robert Wuthnow's "problem of articulation" to give context to some of the positions the Qur'an takes on issues such as slavery and women's rights and even the penal code (166).

<sup>56</sup> The Qur'an placed restrictions on polygyny, and stipulated that a dowry should be given directly to the bride instead of its becoming the property of her father; and the practice of a stepson's inheriting his father's spouse was denounced.

Conversely, in Islamic law a Christian or a Jewish spouse of a Muslim is fully entitled to retain her respective faith in the marriage.

men, who were obliged to provide for the spouse and family, while also taking charge of their affairs and needs.58 It is further maintained that the Qur'an's prescriptions were guided by the need to balance a program of reform with the pragmatics of challenging deep-rooted practices and beliefs: and, that idealistically, the Qur'an was committed to essential equality and justice; in addition, the literature of the *ḥadīth*s includes statements such as "The most perfect of believers is he who excels in moral rectitude and the worthiest of you are those who are benevolent to their women," which would appear to complement the idea that it is an egalitarian ethic that serves as the desideratum of scriptural legislation. In the Qur'an due emphasis always appears to be placed on asking its readers to question ethically the appropriateness of one's conduct and attitude toward others, and it is this aspect of exhortation that is frequently embedded in legal discourses. The contention is that pronouncements on mundane matters were never intended to dissipate the spiritual and gender equality that the Qur'an unequivocally endorsed. Indeed, this also leads to the more general contention that although the Qur'an treats women and men differently, it "does not mean that it establishes them as being unequal": others have suggested that the changing dynamic of conditions and circumstance requires that an ethico-legal treatment of text be applied when assessing the Qur'anic pronouncements on women.59 A survey of the various contributions made by women to the social and intellectual life of the

community in classical Islamic societies demonstrates the very active role they played in societies, participating in all spheres of religious and public life.

Recently, in grappling with issues of equality, modern Islamic feminist writers and reformers do remonstrate that the original ethic of Qur'anic teachings was subverted in medieval exegetical and legal discourses through the overbearing influence of patriarchal biases in the form of models and paradigms that were applied in explication of the Qur'an: the suggestion is that the vagaries of vested interests and substrate cultural influences skewed the Qur'an's message of equality. The contention is that the Qur'an does not endorse the inferior status of women, but that such impressions were allowed to prevail because of these biases.60 The corollary to this is that reclaiming the egalitarian ethic espoused by the Qur'an can only be achieved by adopting a holistic approach to the interpretation of verses covering women and their rights and one that is anchored to an appreciation of the text's overall preoccupation with issues of social justice.61 With this in mind, an acute distinction is drawn between legal mandates in the Qur'an and moral ones, with the former being viewed as historically contingent and relevant only to the ancient Arabian context in which they were originally conceived, whereas verses that addressed issues of general morality retained their universal import and efficacy, forming the basis for contemporary ways of interpreting the sources. The claim is that in the context of discussions about conceptions of dignity and equality, gender biases were immaterial and that egalitarianism forms one of the

The argument is that the body of *ḥadīth*s reflects greater patriarchal predispositions, representing a retreat from the egalitarian ethic of the Qur'an.

cornerstones of the Qur'anic ethos in which dignity is unambiguously equated with rights.62 Debating these issues continues to dominate current discourses on reform in Islam.

On the subject of developing new angles from which to broach the concept of dignity, Mohammad Kamali has produced a lengthy disquisition that explores the subject with reference to the classical concept of public interest or (*maṣlaḥa*). Based on theories about the underlying purpose of the law (*maqāṣid*), in terms of safeguarding benefits and averting harm, classical jurists identified five essential values or aims that were deemed central to the idea of public interest, and these included the protection of faith, life, private property, mind, and offspring. Invoking the idea of *maṣlaḥā*, Kamali emphasized that these values were premised on the underlying notion of "the dignity of the human person," which must "be protected as a matter of priority."63 He maintained that on the subject of freedom of expression and the relinquishing of one's faith, support for the right to make personal choices is also to be found in the traditional sources; he states that this is implicitly recognized in the Qur'an, which states: "There is no compulsion in religion" (Q. 2:256).64 The appeal to the notion of *maṣlaḥa* in the

Hence, Article 1 states, "All human beings are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities, without any discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, language, sex, religious belief, political affiliation, social status or other considerations." But on the subject of equality in Article 6 it is stated, "Woman is equal to man in human dignity and has rights to enjoy as well as duties to perform. She has her own civil entity and financial independence, and the right to retain her name and lineage." The need to separate the political and cultural opposition to the UDHR and the Islamic position is stressed by Mayer.

Jurists also developed *qawāʿid fiqhiyya* (legal maxims), a set of universal rules that are derived through a circumspect gauging of the overall objectives of the law. Such maxims, of which there are five principal ones, were used to deal with unprecedented cases not specified in the sources. A second genre was the area of legal stratagems (*ḥiyal*), which strive to yield compliance with the letter of the law if not its spirit.

discourses of reform is not novel: distinguished Muslim reformers such as the Egyptian Muhammad Abduh (d. 1905) advocated a review of the "conventional" approaches across a spectrum of issues, from women's rights to religious pluralism. He cited the classical legal concept of public interest, on the assumption that Islamic law was designed to serve as a viable instrument of social reform and change; its purpose was not to subdue rights and freedoms.65 While with reference to philosophical theology, Abdulaziz Sachedina has propounded the view that Muʿtazilī rational moral theory combined with an ethical approach to law has the potential to yield a framework for expressions of human dignity and autonomy that demonstrate a distinct compatibility with western liberal views on human individuality and dignity as enshrined within the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.66 He makes the point that the tendency to point to supposed tensions between Islamic thought and the ideals that underpin the UDHR seemingly stems from contrived attempts to present the Islamic position as being monolithic. He links this to a crisis of epistemology in current Islamic thought, arguing that the state of affairs is detrimental because impressions of the classical Islamic position on dignity are frequently informed in academic circles by reference to modern apologetic and retrograde treatments of the subject that fail to grasp the richness of the original sources or use the appropriate ethical tools of analysis when gauging the textual sources.67 The apposite point has been made that often political and cultural exigencies were driving opposition toward aspects of the UDHR by certain Arab and Islamic countries, and it is alleged that alternative Islamic

## Conclusions

It has been mooted that the "the genuine greatness in the achievements of classical Islamic civilization" is reflected in its ability to integrate and cultivate systems of thought with which it came into contact.69 Significantly, the traditional scriptural sources also played a critical role in creating the environment for such processes to flourish. The rich range of discussions and perspectives relevant to the concept of dignity in classical Islamic thought underpins the efficacy of this arrangement. Previously, academic surveys of the concept of dignity in Islamic discourses have underestimated not only the true scale and potential of the Islamic materials, but also the rich tapestry of integrated formats through which ideas germane to morality and innate worth were articulated and applied in legal, theological, and ethical discussions. Certainly, the increasing number of scholarship and studies devoted to exploring Islamic notions of dignity and related areas of ethics will help to nurture a better understanding of the richness of the materials on the subject and draw welcome attention to their intellectual and practical merits.
