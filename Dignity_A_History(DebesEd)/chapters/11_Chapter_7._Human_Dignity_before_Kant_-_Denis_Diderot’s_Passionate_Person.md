# Chapter 7: Human Dignity before Kant Denis Diderot's Passionate Person

*Remy Debes*

The European Enlightenment is remembered as an electric age of innovation—and understandably so. In everything from ethics, politics, government, and economics to science, medicine, industry, and technology, the spirit of progress burned feverishly hot for more than a hundred years (ca. 1650–1800). Old dogmas were challenged. Political systems were upended. Ancient morals were rethought. Even the idea of "enlightenment" came in for debate before it was all over.1

But alongside all this supposed progress there was a complicated reality. Alongside heated discussions of social justice, for example, the situation of women barely changed. Women remained disenfranchised

<sup>1</sup> Scholars don't agree on how best to demarcate the beginning and end of the Enlightenment. Some suggest that we err to speak literally of *the* Enlightenment, as opposed to several national enlightenments, e.g., the Scottish Enlightenment, the French Enlightenment, the German Enlightenment, etc. As for the self-conscious debate over the meaning of "enlightenment," see James Schmidt, ed., *What Is Enlightenment? Eighteenth-Century Answers and Twentieth-Century Questions* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996).

at the end of the Enlightenment, inserting their voices into the fray only with difficulty or by clandestine means. Alongside inspiring calls for religious toleration, "the Jewish question" was explicitly posed for the first time and bred a full-fledged discussion of how to solve the Jewish "problem."2 And alongside astonishing developments in technology and the rise of a new economic mindset that empowered the working class, there was a massive expansion of slavery. Granted, this expansion was followed by a decline in slavery during the second half of the century. But recent studies have shown that this decline had little to do with "enlightened" resistance to slavery.3 Thus, by the close of the eighteenth century the slave trade had returned to its old vigor, and by 1822 the number of slaves in the New World more than doubled from its eighteenth century peak.4

In short, the political and social realities of the Enlightenment were complicated. We should not be surprised, then, to learn that the same is true of the concept of human dignity that emerged from the period. And yet this conceptual complexity is not well appreciated today. This is largely because scholars interested in the idea of human dignity, and philosophers in particular, have focused on one Enlightenment thinker to the exclusion of almost all others, namely, Immanuel Kant (1724–1804). Indeed, Kant's famous dictate—that we must always treat "humanity" "at the same time as an end, never merely as a means"—is often treated as *the* wellspring of Enlightenment thought about human dignity.5 By contrast, this chapter will show that the

<sup>3</sup> Another myth is that the "decline" was due to the enlightened efforts of abolitionists. In fact, the "dip" was mostly the result of nonmoral causes such as the disruptions of war, the destruction of British plantations by freak late-century hurricanes, and a corresponding short-term flood of cheap sugar, cacao, cotton, and indigo from the competing French plantations in St. Dominic.

concept of dignity in the eighteenth century was actually older, more nuanced, more diverse, and ultimately more interesting than it is usually thought to be.

## Enter the French Architect

According to Kant, the normative ground of dignity—what justifies our duty to treat persons as ends in themselves—is our rational nature or autonomy. How intriguing, then, that it is precisely this claim about the ultimate appeal to rationality that Kant's predecessor, Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–1778), seems to set aside at the outset of his own seminal treatise in ethics, *Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality Among Men*. Rousseau writes, "It would seem that if I am obliged not to harm another being like myself, this is so less because it is a rational being than because it is a sentient (*sensible*) being."6

But what does Rousseau mean by "sentient"? And why think that his remark reflects a different Enlightenment view about human worth? That is, why think that it reflects a bona fide position on human dignity that diverges from Kant's rationalist one? Who were the proponents of this position? And what were its principles?

My inquiry will require moving back and forth between these questions and their answers. But as prelude, I offer the following summary. At one limit, Rousseau thought of sentience as entailing merely the capacity to suffer. However, Rousseau wasted little time fleshing this out to mean, *passionate* nature in general. Thus, although Rousseau is famous for theorizing the delusory powers of some passions (like envy and the other products of what he called *amoure propre*)—no careful reader

<sup>6</sup> Jean-Jacques Rousseau, *Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men* (1755), in *The Discourses and Other Early Political Writings*, ed. Victor Gourevitch (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 128. The quoted sentence continues, "a quality which, since it is common to beast and man, must at least give the beast the right not to be needlessly maltreated by man."

misunderstands that, for Rousseau, respecting others requires recognizing them as passionate persons. Moreover, in marking a positive place for the passions in moral life, Rousseau was only one voice among many. The eighteenth century was distinguished by an array of philosophical and literary work meant to recuperate the passions from their negative characterization in older philosophical and especially religious systems.7 And in some cases, this optimism about the passions led to a distinctive conception about human worth. Or better, because more precise, this optimism lead not simply to an *instrumental* defense of the value of passions—because, say, passion can be the proper motivational consequence of right reason—but instead, this optimism led to the view that the passions in some sense *constitute* one's fundamental moral worth.

And yet it is important to appreciate that this new perspective on human worth wasn't fashioned out of whole cloth. As I will argue, it was connected—at least in one important case—to a concrete account of human dignity penned well before Kant, namely, in the seventeenth-century natural law theory of Samuel Pufendorf (1632– 1694). Indeed, Pufendorf waxed so powerfully poetic about the moral status of human beings, one wonders how his historical pride of place is not better known. In any event, as I will argue in the final sections, it turns out that when we cast our gaze forward, *from* Pufendorf *to* the eighteenth century, we find a version of Pufendorf 's view in the French Enlightenment, but with this important difference: the view is revised to make room for the idea of the passionate person. Perhaps equally surprising, given my lead-up to this point, is that this "Pufendorfian" defense of human dignity doesn't come from Rousseau. It comes from Rousseau's compatriot, the great architect of the *Encyclopédie*, Denis Diderot (1713–1784).

<sup>7</sup> Professional philosophy remains less than ideally receptive to the role literature played (and continues to play) in furthering philosophical thought. This must change because literature is where many minority voices find their place. The story I tell here is thus necessarily incomplete. However, other chapters in this volume do address the role of literature. See also Lynn Festa's *Sentimental Figures of Empire in Eighteenth Century Britain and France* (Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 2006).

## A Formal Definition of "Dignity"

Before we dig too deep, we must consider a potential obstacle. Prior to the translation of Kant's *Groundwork* into English, and specifically Kant's term *Würde* as "dignity," the term "dignity" had no currency as anything like "the fundamental moral worth had by all humans." (This is true both for the English term and its Latin and French counterparts.) This *moralized* connotation of the term—which is the connotation of "dignity" I am interested in—didn't exist until the very end of the century.8 Instead, in everything from Hobbes's *Leviathan* (1651) to Samuel Johnson's *Dictionary* (1755), the term "dignity" was dominated by a conventional *merit* connotation: it meant something like high social rank.9 The potential problem, then, is that my inquiry seems to risk anachronism. That is, it might seem anachronistic to search for a theory of dignity before Kant, given that prior to Kant, the term "dignity" simply didn't refer to a person's fundamental moral worth.

I am tempted to say that this worry is simply overanxious. Kant himself indicated earlier sources for his ideas about human dignity and respect. Indeed, he paid high praise to Rousseau on exactly this point.10 Kant also credited the ancient Stoics for influencing his view

<sup>8</sup> The earliest translators of Kant, Abbot (1895) and Paton (1947), both translate *Würde* with "dignity," as does John Richardson (who was also the earliest translator of *Religion within the Bounds of Reason*)—although, as Oliver Sensen pointed out to me, in the recent Cambridge translation of Kant's lectures on ethics, Heath translates *Würde* sometimes as "dignity" and sometimes as "worth" (Immanuel Kant, *Lectures on Ethics*, ed. J. B. Schneewind, trans. Peter Heath [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001]).

<sup>9</sup> Johnson defines dignity as "rank of elevation." "Page View, Page 591." *A Dictionary of the English Language: A Digital Edition of the 1755 Classic by Samuel Johnson*, ed. Brandi Besalke, last modified, December 6, 2012.

<sup>10</sup> "Rousseau set me right about this," Kant famously remarked. "I learned to honor humanity" (AK 20:44, cited by Allen Wood in his "General Introduction" to Kant, *Practical Philosophy*, xvii). For a very good primer on Rousseau's influence, see George Armstrong Kelly, "Rousseau, Kant, and History," *Journal of the History of Ideas* 29, no. 3 (1968): 347–64. For a more recent entry into this scholarship, which takes up the question of Kant's novelty, see Karl Ameriks, *Kant's Elliptical Path*, especially the chapter "Kant, Human Nature, and History after Rousseau" (Oxford: Oxford University Press 2012), 29–45.

of respect.11 Thus it seems we already have an invitation from Kant to look before Kant, for a "Kantian" concept of dignity. On the other hand, I concede that the lack of terminological signposts is a challenge. We need a marker other than the term "dignity" to alert us to a live discussion of the concept of dignity in pre-Kantian thought. We need, in other words, a *formal* definition of dignity.

By this I mean we need a definition that abstracts away from all *substantive* claims about what it is in human nature that makes it true that we have dignity.12 For example, Kant's claim that we have dignity in virtue of our rational autonomy is a substantive claim. By contrast, a formal definition of dignity will identify the general conceptual features or conditions that apply to any such substantive claim. For example, regardless of what we think makes it true that we have dignity (such as autonomy), dignity is often said to be something humans don't earn. If we accept this claim, then this feature of being "unearned" would be formal. As such, it would serve as a constraint on any substantive claim. Thus one might sensibly say, "I'm not sure what it is about being human that makes it true that we have dignity. Maybe it is our capacity for rationality. Maybe it is something else. But whatever it is, it better be something we don't have to earn. Or I won't call it dignity."

To be clear, the formal features of dignity we select will be stipulated in the sense that they will be drawn explicitly from our contemporary use of the term. But this is precisely the point. If we articulate a formal definition in this way, then these conceptual features, and not the actual term, can serve as signposts for historical inquiry. That is, we can use these formal features to determine whether anything like our present-day moralized concept of dignity existed *before* this concept

<sup>11</sup> "These philosophers," Kant once noted, "derived their universal moral principle from the dignity of human nature, from its freedom (as an independence from the power of the inclinations), and they could not have laid down a better or nobler principle for foundation" (*Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason*, trans. and ed. Allen Wood and George Di Giovanni [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998], AK 6:57n). Oliver Sensen makes this point in *Kant on Human Dignity* (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2011), 165.

<sup>12</sup> This paragraph repeats a similar one in my introduction to this volume.

was reliably *called* "dignity." In short, following this approach avoids anachronism, or at least greatly mitigates it.

So what are the general conceptual conditions of the concept of dignity, as we use this concept today?13 Answering questions like this is always contentious given that it is always a further question who the relevant "we" is, that is being used to guide the answer. I can only hope my own assumptions will seem plausible. They are as follows: First, the primary interest of this inquiry is human persons and human dignity. Thus, if any claims we discover about dignity in early Enlightenment thought extend to animals, let alone plants or rocks—well, this would be a fortuitous result for them. But as a formal matter, we can start with our intuitions about the value of being human. Second, and following from the first, talk of human dignity seems connected to an enduring and literally ancient intuition that to be human entails some kind of *distinctive* value—though not necessarily a unique value.14

In light of these starting assumptions, I propose the following roughand-ready formal definition: "Dignity" (as a concept) purports to identify the existence of a kind of moral community between humans, the "membership" of which is unearned and normatively privileged.15 Let me unpack this, first with two clarifications to show how it answers to the starting intuitions, and then with a few elaborations.

First clarification: The intended domain of the concept is the human community, but this does not amount to speciesism. The definition does *not* say we have dignity just because we are human. The

<sup>13</sup> I have defended the methodology I'm following in this section at greater length in Remy Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," *Philosophical Perspectives* 23 (2009): 46–78.

<sup>14</sup> Granted, since antiquity many have leveraged this intuition about "distinctiveness" into the idea that humans are supremely valuable (at least, among "created" things), but vindicating the intuition of distinctiveness doesn't entail this further move. And given that we are trying to shape a tool for historical excavation, a thinner formal definition is preferable.

<sup>15</sup> One might wonder whether this definition applies to honor as well. The relation between dignity and honor is complex, and not something I can take up here. Moreover, I think the conditions I go on to spell out below mitigate the worry that my definition is too broad.

definition says that what dignity is, is a kind of moral status humans attribute to each other. And it says something formal about the nature of that status, namely, that it is unearned and normatively privileged. It also makes no claim about *what it takes* to have that status, except in one obvious negative sense: Having dignity does not depend on any conventional membership status such as state citizenship. For, such membership would be in plain tension with the idea that the status is unearned.

Second clarification: According to the formal definition, dignity is not just a descriptive concept. It is a concept with a practical purpose or function. Understood loosely, this function is to "set off " in our practical deliberations whatever dignity is ascribed to. That is, when we are deliberating about whether to do this or that, or to say this or that, and so on, the concept of dignity is somehow supposed to guard or protect whatever one thinks has dignity. At any rate, this is what the designation of a "normatively privileged" status is meant to do, and in turn, how this definition is meant to satisfy the second starting assumption about dignity being a distinctive value. What has dignity is supposed to get distinctive *treatment* when we think about how to act with respect to what has it.

What kind of treatment? To answer this, consider again the formal claim that dignity is unearned. I propose that we understand this to mean that the status in question is in no way elected or bequeathed by other persons. One doesn't achieve, win, or acquire this status in any sense that is essentially dependent on the goodwill, intentions, or attitudes of another. In other words, if your having dignity would in any way require you to praise, congratulate, or in any sense show gratitude *back* toward the person recognizing your dignity, then the theory in question would not be correct. Call this the "no backward merit" condition.16

<sup>16</sup> See again, Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet."

The no-backward-merit condition makes the meaning of "unearned" essentially relational, or interpersonal. And this underlines a crucial feature of the account I'm offering. As I noted earlier, human dignity is a value that earns its conceptual distinctiveness from the demands it places on how we treat one another. In the light of the no-backward-merit condition, we can now elaborate this thought by saying that what human dignity *is* partly depends on, or is defined by, how other people *respond* to it. We simply cannot make sense of the kind of value that dignity is, outside of an interpersonal context. Unlike an ice cream cone, which might be relished were it and some person the only objects in existence, dignity requires mention of another person. Or, as I've put this point elsewhere, "dignity" comes to life within the interpersonal, even if only imagined: in the café, classroom, clinic, court, combat zone, or closet.17 If this sounds plausible, then the following final point should tie all the formal features together.

The usual way to account for the interpersonal nature of dignity is in terms of attitudes of respect. In other words, dignity is often said to be the fitting or proper object of respect. But not any kind of respect will do. It can't be the kind of respect one shows for the *merit* that one estimates a person or object to have. Such "appraisal respect," as it is sometimes called, is what we might show while gazing at Van Gogh's *Starry Night*, or what an apprentice metalworker shows to the master smithy. This kind of respect is earned, and hence not an appropriate response to dignity. Instead, dignity demands what is sometimes called "recognition respect." Recognition respect is the proper *deliberative deference* given to another entity in virtue of that entity's status.18 Thus, if humans have dignity, then the correct or fitting response

<sup>17</sup> Debes, "Dignity's Gauntlet," 67.

<sup>18</sup> I've framed the concept of recognition respect in a way that highlights its relevance to persons. But as Stephen Darwall first introduced the concept in his essay "Two Kinds of Respect," *Ethics* 88, no. 1 (1977): 36–49, recognition respect had greater generality, namely, as a disposition to give appropriate consideration in one's practical deliberation to another person or thing in virtue of some fact about it.

to humans—the correct interpersonal attitude for each of us to have toward one another—is to take measures not to overlook each other in our practical deliberations about what to do, or say, and so on. But also, we must take such measures precisely because of the unearned, privileged status each of us has. These are the formal conditions we seem to hold ourselves to when we talk of dignity in its moralized sense.

Our question has thus become: Is there any pre-Kantian Enlightenment account of human worth that satisfies the formal definition of dignity just articulated?

## "I Am Not a Dog": Samuel Pufendorf's Account of Dignity

In the background of Enlightenment moral philosophy was a debate over what today is known as theological voluntarism—the view that God wills laws that bind all humans equally, but that God's will is not itself bound by these laws. Voluntarism came to the fore during the Protestant Reformation, and took its lead from the doctrine of total human depravity defended by Martin Luther and John Calvin. On this doctrine, human nature is utterly corrupt both in reason and in will. We are not only overcome with selfish and corrupt motives (will), we also can never hope to understand God's will by dint of our own dim intellect (reason). Indeed, the only reason we are able to grasp for following morality, many voluntarists claimed, is the threat of God's sanctions, which sanctions God has attached to his laws.

Now, importantly, by the time Samuel Pufendorf came onto the scene, an alternative to this Protestant view was already on offer, namely in the form of Hugo Grotius's (1583–1645) natural law philosophy. Grotius argued that despite our selfishness—or better, essentially in tension with that selfishness—we are also naturally sociable. In Grotius's words, all humans have "an impelling desire

for society."19 In particular, we inherently desire a peaceful society. Furthermore, Grotius advocated a more optimistic view of our (human) capacity to understand moral laws. Grotius thus ended up positioned against Reformation voluntarism and the pessimistic view of human nature that undergirded it. For the same reason, Grotius became a source of inspiration for many more optimistically minded moralists of the Enlightenment like Shaftesbury, David Hume, Diderot, and Adam Smith.

But there was a problem with Grotius's break from voluntarism: for all its optimism, it jeopardized morality. Although the claim of innate sociability injected a motivational source for morality, it remained unclear why we *should* choose prosocial or altruist motives *over* private, selfish interests. Grotius's own attempt to answer this worry turned on a realist conception of natural human rights, which he argued supplied reasons to constrain or act against our selfish motives. The question was, why think that such rights-based reasons "trump" reasons derived from self-interest? That is, even if we beleive that such rights "really" exist—it isn't clear why we must, morally, defer to rights claims when these claims conflict with our private interests. Indeed, this was precisely the kind of question Pufendorf pressed against Grotius in *The Whole Duty of Man* (1735). Nothing in Grotius's account, Pufendorf argued, can get us to the kind of moral necessity Grotius argued for. Only the notion of *command*, Pufendorf claimed, could carry that kind of trumping authority.20 Or, as Jean Barbeyrac, Pufendorf 's

<sup>20</sup> S. Pufendorf 's *De officio hominis et civis* (*The Whole Duty of Man, According to the Law of Nature*), ed. Ian Hunter and David Saunders (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2003);. NB: This text is based on the 1735 edition of Andrew Tooke's English translation. Tooke's first translation of 1691 was from the original Latin version of *De officio*, published in 1673. However, Tooke's translation was thereafter modified by anonymous editors in light of Barbeyrac's own translation into French in 1707 and subsequent commentaries to produce the 1735 edition. Hunter and Saunders provide careful commentary on these changes. I have also made relevant comparisons to the more recent translation: Samuel Pufendorf, *On the Duty of Man and Citizen According to Natural Law*, ed. James Tully, trans. Michael Silverthorne (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991). I have not, however, found critical differences in the passages I quote, which are from the Liberty Fund edition.

eighteenth-century defender, put the same point: "To speak exactly, the duty and obligation, or the indispensable necessity of conforming to these ideas, and maxims [about social life] necessarily supposes a superior power, a supreme master of mankind."21 In short, Pufendorf retreated to voluntarism. Indeed, *every* moral property, Pufendorf elsewhere claimed, ultimately depends on the imposition of natural law through God's supremely authoritative will.22

Unfortunately for Pufendorf, his commitment to voluntarism ran over into politics. Thus, although Pufendorf formally endorsed the idea that individual will and consent are the principles of political legitimacy, he allied with Hobbes on the particular point of absolute sovereignty to solve the question of political authority. In the increasingly tolerant and secular atmosphere of eighteenth-century Europe, especially Britain and France, this struck many as regressive. When it came to politics, next-century liberals like Diderot, Hume, and Smith thought as their contemporary Sophie de Grouchy did, when she condemned "the pretended rights" of the despot: "As if reason could approve leaving to a sovereign (who, sometimes, can be a tyrant) no other restraint than his remorse, the progress of Enlightenment, or the despair of his victims … as if reason could permit any power whatsoever originally established in the common interest to become a source of tyrannical privilege and a license for immunity for its holders!"23

Stephen Darwall emphasizes the same point I'm making here. Darwall adds that, according to Pufendorf, not even "good repute and turpitude can be conceived to exist before law, and without the imposition of a superior" (LNNO, 27; quoted in Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 215).

The attentive reader will notice I have left out Rousseau. This is because Rousseau's position is complicated. Outward appearances suggest he also would have no truck with despotism, but certain aspects of his arguments come into tension with these first impressions.

In short, none of these thinkers had much truck with Pufendorf 's conclusions.

And yet Pufendorf made a crucial innovation on the idea of human worth—one that, as we will see, had a lasting if hitherto unappreciated influence. In a recent illuminating analysis, Stephen Darwall notes a crucial distinction in Pufendorf 's discussion of obligation, namely, between (1) our obligation to comply with laws of nature "in general"; and (2) what Darwall calls our "mutual (bipolar) human obligations."24 To reiterate, Pufendorf thinks the normative force of the former obligation depends entirely on God's supreme will. However, Darwall, argues, the latter obligation is partly conceptually independent of such voluntarism. Two elements are at work, as Darwall sees it. On the one hand, Pufendorf allies with Grotius on the question of sociability. Thus, Darwall writes: "Both understand *socialitas* as essentially involving *relationships* that are already conceived in terms of mutual recognition of individuals' respective authorities or normative "powers," that is, in terms of their capacities to have obligations to and rights against one another."25 On the other hand, and unlike Grotius, Darwall continues, "an essential aspect of Pufendorf 's theory … is that mutual perfect obligations are tied to a view of the equal *dignity* of any being capable of sociability and, accordingly, to the idea that persons share a basic authority over themselves and their own lives."26

Within Pufendorf 's theory, then, Darwall suggests there is an argument that runs roughly as follows: Human beings have perfect natural human rights (rights owed to one another) in virtue of a certain moral standing that we reciprocally assign one another, namely, the standing to make rights claims to or against one another. And we assign this standing as a constitutive part of being sociable, which sociability nature commands us to cultivate. In other words, part of being

<sup>25</sup> Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 215.

<sup>26</sup> Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 216.

sociable involves *assuming* the other has this peculiar status. For, on the one hand, insofar as we hold others accountable for any actions that affect us or others, we intrinsically conceive of them as having what Pufendorf called a "moral power," namely, we acknowledge them as moral causes. And, on the other hand, it is a natural law to be sociable, that is, to enter into relationships of accountability.27

The upshot of Darwall's analysis is not only a revision of Grotius's view of sociability, but also the implication of a bona fide concept of human dignity. Consider: For Grotius, our sociability—our "impelling desire for society"—was the grounds of rights and obligations. By contrast, for Pufendorf sociability—"being sociable"—is the content of the fundamental law of nature. And "being sociable" just is to see others as accountable beings.28 Thus Pufendorf writes of "sociability" in *Of the Law of Nature and Nations*: "We mean an attitude of each man towards every other man, by which each is understood to be bound to the other by kindness, peace, and love, and therefore by a mutual obligation" (LNNO, 208). In other words, being sociable means having a particular practical *perspective*: a sociable person sees others as *moral agents*, namely, as beings who have rights against herself, and, consequently, as beings she thinks of herself as obligated toward. Indeed, Pufendorf goes on to conclude that "since it is an integral part of human nature as such" to cultivate this perspective, human beings enjoy an "equality of right" (LNNO, 333). And in so saying, Pufendorf puts into place the last piece of a concept akin to our contemporary notion of dignity.29 Thus notice that Pufendorf has now satisfied our formal criteria. He has delivered a concept of a moral status or standing

<sup>27</sup> The foregoing is a condensed summary of Darwall's main argument in "Pufendorf on Morality."

<sup>28</sup> As Darwall puts it, mutual obligations are already "built into" sociability on Pufendorf 's view ("Pufendorf on Morality," 222).

<sup>29</sup> Darwall reaches the same conclusion. He writes, "A sociable attitude, as Pufendorf understands it, includes mutual respect for one another's equal dignity as men. It is a 'precept of natural law,' therefore, that everyone should '*permit others to enjoy the same right that he himself does*'" (Darwall, "Pufendorf on Morality," 223, quoting Pufendorf, LNNO, 336). Granted, the last line from Pufendorf might bother us, inasmuch as it speaks of "permission" where we might hope for a connotation of "entitlement"—at least, if dignity is to meet the criterion of being unearned. In fact, there is no obstacle here. On Pufendorf 's view "sociable" is a normative concept. Thus, being sociable *requires* mutual "permission" of status between agents. Thus, anyone who does not so "permit" others this status, for whatever reason, is unsocial and thus in violation of natural law (see Pufendorf, LNNO, 336).

with normative privilege (it grounds rights claims), which is unearned (it is assumed as a constitutive part of any social relationship). In fact, in one of his most poetic expressions, which I shall refer to as his "dignity dictate," Pufendorf even uses the actual term "dignity," thus marking the first time in the modern era the term was used to connote a systematic concept of dignity as we think of it today:

There seems to him to be somewhat of *Dignity* (*dignatio*) in the appellation of Man: so that the last and most efficacious Argument to curb the Arrogance of insulting Men, is usually, *I am not a Dog, but a Man as well as your self*. Since then Human Nature is the *same* in us all, and since no Man will or can cheerfully join in Society with any, by whom he is not at least to be esteemed equally a Man and a Partaker of the same Common Nature: It follows that, among those *Duties which Men owe to each other*, this obtains the *second* place, That *every Man esteem and treat another*, as naturally *equal to himself*, *or as one who is a Man as well as he*. (I.VII.1, 100)

Pufendorf 's advocacy of equal dignity in this passage, as well as his use of the actual term "dignity" to make his argument, all long before Kant, is remarkable. However, it was not beyond rebuke or revision, and for reasons separate from its voluntarist underpinning.

In the first place, there is Pufendorf 's inglorious attitude toward slavery, which at the very least amounted to permission. "It is also the Practice," Pufendorf wrote in his explicit discussion of masters and servants, "to pass away our Property in such *Slaves* who are taken in War, or bought with our Money, to whom we please, after the same manner as we do our other Goods and Commodities; so that the *Body of such Servant* is holden to be a Chattel of his Master" (II.IV.5, 186).

And although Pufendorf recalls his own claims about dignity at this precise moment, it is precisely the fact that dignity is not offered up as the grounds of abolition, but only a mere side constraint, that should distress us. Thus, he writes:

And yet here *Humanity* bids us not forget that this Servant is a Man, however, and therefore ought not to be treated as we do our Moveables, use 'em or abuse 'em, or destroy 'em as we list. And when we are minded to part with him, we ought not to deliver him into the Hands of such, as we know will abuse him inhumanly and undeservedly. (II.IV.5, 186)

No doubt in his own mind, Pufendorf spoke righteously here. But set next to the poetics of the original dignity dictate, it is hard not to cringe over these words.30

There was also this: Pufendorf 's view left little space for the passionate person. That is, he left little space to think moral agency by which I simply mean whatever capacity or capacities a person requires to be a bona fide moral agent—is positively constituted by, or founded on, human passionate nature. According to Pufendorf, having the requisite status of dignity required a certain kind of agency, namely, one that involves the ability to enter into mutualclaiming relationships. As I put the point before, being sociable for Pufendorf amounts to a certain practical "perspective": the sociable person sees others as moral agents themselves, as beings who have rights against oneself, and, consequently, as beings one thinks of herself as obligated toward. The "consequently" in this statement now

<sup>30</sup> Pufendorf 's contradictory permission, or at least tolerance, for slavery unfortunately was not an explicit reason motivating the next wave of dignity proponents toward revision of his view. Frankly, only Diderot speaks at length or with great passion on the subject. Thus, though he didn't pick out Pufendorf explicitly, Diderot can be credited with a sustained and spirited attack on colonial racism and slavery, delivered in his *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville,* which I return to later.

looms large. For it highlights the *rational* sense of agency at work. Sociable agency, according to Pufendorf, involves (1) seeing others as (that is, assuming them to be) claim makers; and (2) a conjoined if tacit recognition that this "power" to make claims is shared in common. In short, one recognizes others as claim makers like oneself. But, of course, to make claims is to exercise a distinctly rational capacity. It is thus a distinctly rational "aspect" of agency, we might say, that we recognize in others when we are properly sociable according to Pufendorf.

It is thus crucial that it is precisely this kind of claim about moral agency that Diderot, Rousseau, Smith, and De Grouchy challenged. To these later thinkers we are not simply rational agents; we are also passionate agents. In particular, moral agency requires certain affective capacities. And crucially, these capacities are not merely the executors of reason's will. Passion feeling, emotion, sentiment—these are not simply vehicles for motivation.31 Instead, agency itself is in some sense *constituted* by emotion and passion or the corresponding dispositions. In other words, passion partly structures, at a substantive level, our agency. And this "passionate" aspect of human agency bears fundamentally on any claim about human dignity. Correspondingly, any theory that resolves the substantive nature of human dignity into only rational terms like autonomy, or in Pufendorf 's case, claim-making, is impoverished. Likewise, whatever duty we have to respect other persons in virtue of their dignity, this duty must involve respecting persons as emotional agents, not simply as rational agents. Or so I'm suggesting all these various thinkers would have inclined. But let's begin drawing the circle in, specifically toward Diderot.

<sup>31</sup> In this chapter I take the liberty of treating these terms synonymously. I duly note, however, that the term "emotion" was only just emerging in the eighteenth century, and, moreover, that terms like "passion," "emotion," "sentiment," "affection," and "feeling" were not synonymous even if distinctions between them were becoming harder to parse. See Thomas Dixon, *From Passions to Emotions: The Creations of a Secular Psychological Category* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003).

## Thoughts of the Heart

The Enlightenment had many hearts. One of these was undoubtedly the *Encyclopédie*—the ambitious, deeply controversial, nearly aborted eighteen-volume anthology of science and philosophy, published between 1751 and 1772, and orchestrated almost single-handedly by Diderot.32 It was a project that itself had many hearts, one of which was the officially anonymous entry "Le Philosophe," often remembered for its grand proclamation, "Reason is to the *philosopher* what grace is to the Christian."33 How interesting, then, that "Le Philosophe" also goes on to express skepticism of abstract reason. In particular, it rejects ancient rationalist conceptions of human practical nature and their usual deprecating view of passion. The Stoic *sage insensible* is no man, Le Philosophe says, only a *fantôme*. The time to rethink the value and role of passions had arrived in Europe.

This rehabilitation of passion took different forms depending on the target. Sometimes the goal was to reform passion's oft-claimed status as the rabble rouser to reason; sometimes it was the Socratic and Stoic view of passion as the handmaiden of right reason (a view recast by Spinoza and Leibniz in the modern world); and still other times it was the view of passion as the wellspring of vice, typical of medieval Christian and Reformation Protestant conceptions of human nature.34 The cumulative upshot might roughly be divided into two categories, which, while not mutually exclusive, were also not mutually entailing.

<sup>32</sup> Its full title was *Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers* (*Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts*). In the early stages, Le Rond d'Alembert was also centrally involved, though even then the driving force was still Diderot.

<sup>33</sup> Anonymous, "Le Philosophe," in *Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de letters*, eds. D. Diderot and M. d'Alembert, 36 vols., vol. 12 (1766, but originally ca. 1743) (Lausanne: Société typographique, 1778–81).

<sup>34</sup> The scholarship in this respect is now quite large. The most influential early voices included Peter Gay, Susan James, and Jonathan Israel. More recently, Dixon's *From Passions to Emotions* deserves mention. With respect to reform of religious attitudes, it took on a political dimension that was especially pronounced in France, where the spirit of toleration had not yet prevailed, and which was thus straining against the yoke of repressive Christian policies that were tied tightly to entrenched views about the corrupting effects of human passion. See also note 38.

On the one hand, there was a general rethinking of the utility of emotion for morality. For example, Shaftesbury introduced the idea of a moral sense that worked through felt sentiments; Hutcheson extended this moral sense theory to a vigorous defense of benevolence as a moral motive; Voltaire defended the moral innocence of sexual desire and passion; Rousseau argued that some corrupting passions like envy were social products and not part of original human nature; and so on. On the other hand, there was an effort to make a more fundamental reform, namely, to produce the idea of the passionate person—or more exactly, the idea of passionate agency (though I'll hereon use these terms synonymously).

At its limit, the idea of the passionate person was advanced together with a claim that passions were the essence of human nature. La Rochefoucauld (1613–1680), for example, who published his *Maximes* in 1665 and was quoted in "Le Philosophe," asserted that reason is neither the magistrate nor essence of humans. On his view, we are instead essentially passionate creatures. Admittedly, Rochefoucauld was also pessimistic about the moral upshot of the passions.35 However, the same kind of essentialist claim was reiterated in the early eighteenth century with marked optimism by the Marquis de Vauvenargues (1715–1747). According to Vauvenargues, the passions make us who we are: "Nos passions ne sont pas distinctes de nous-memes."36 But also, and crucially, the passions are responsible for our virtues, and not just

It is also worth mentioning that many of these efforts found inspiration in a related optimism about human sociability sparked by Grotius. For more about this specific connection, see Michael Gill, *The British Moralists on Human Nature and the Birth of Secular Ethics* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2011); T. J. Hochstrasser and P. Schröder, eds., *Early Modern Natural Law Theories: Contexts and Strategies in Early Enlightenment* (Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2003); and Knud Haakonssen, *Natural Law and Moral Philosophy: From Grotius to the Scottish Enlightenment* (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996).

<sup>35</sup> This is evidenced straightaway by the epigraph to *Maximes*, "Our virtues are most frequently but vices disguised"—a subtitle that must remind us of another great antagonist of the rational agent, Bernard Mandeville.

<sup>36</sup> Luc de Clapiers, Marquis de Vauvenargues, *Introduction à la connaissance de l'esprit humain*, in *Oeuvres de Vauvenargues*, ed. D.-L. Gilbert (Paris: Furne et Cie, 1857), 31.

for brute motivation. For Vauvenargues, the "noblest" of our thoughts arise *from* the passions: "Les grandes pensées viennent du coeur."37 This "radical" view was mirrored by some British thinkers, most notably, David Hume (1711–1776). Thus Hume claimed that, on the one hand, belief was itself ultimately just a peculiar kind of feeling; and, on the other hand, "reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions." Granted, Hume's skepticism (which was also radical) probably makes it risky to call him an "essentialist" about human passionate nature, like Rochefoucauld or Vauvenargues, but he clearly still advanced an optimistic idea of the passionate person.

As for Diderot, his motives to recuperate the passionate person were wound up with a growing conviction in materialism. Diderot was in the intimate company of materialist thinkers, including especially Baron d'Holbach, whose personal influence on the French salon culture of the day is legend. In particular, as the historian Jonathan Israel has meticulously demonstrated, Holbach was a central player in fanning a kind of Spinozist crush among the Parisian philosophes, which quickened their interest in materialism.38 Also of special importance for Diderot, as Israel points out, were a number of evolutionary works circulating in that scene. These works had gleaned from Abraham Trembley's 1744 work, as Israel puts it, "the implication that nature has the power to create" (746). In particular, there was Maupertuis's *Dissertation Physique à l'occasion du Nègre Blanc* (1744), a work with moderate evolutionary musings, Buffon's *Histoire naturelle* (1749), a work with rather more explicit evolutionary implications, and La Mettrie's *L'Homme machine* (1748), a work of great notoriety in the early days of work on the *Encyclopédie* for its materialist, Spinozist, and atheistic daring. Indeed, the dangerous backlash La Mettrie faced for his book

<sup>37</sup> Vauvenargues, *Maxime* 127. In *The Reflections and Maxims of Luc de Clapiers, Marguis de Vauvenargues*, trans. F. G. Stevens (London: Humphrey Milford, 1940), 34.

<sup>38</sup> Interestingly, both Diderot and Holbach rarely refer explicitly to Spinoza. This is easily explained by the fact that his works were forbidden in France, and Israel provides too much conceptual evidence to ignore. Still, the fact should be noted, as Israel himself glosses over it.

probably explains why, when Diderot—who was familiar with all these works—did get around to expressing his materialist-cum-evolutionist views in the first volume of the *Encyclopédie* (1751), he did so slyly. For example, Diderot amended Chamber's 1728 *Cyclopaedia* definition of *naturalist* as "person who studies nature," to include the claim, "One also gives the name naturalist to those who do not admit God, but one who believes that there is only one material substance."39 Or consider that it was not through an entry on human or man but animal (coauthored with Daubenton) that Diderot chose to be his early vehicle to express materialism. Indeed, the entry "Animal" is little more than a reprisal of Buffon's treatise on generation from *Histoire naturelle*, with interspersed comments. Diderot even reproduced Buffon's conclusion without change: "that living and animation, instead of being a metaphysical degree of being, is [are] a physical property of matter."40

In the light of such materialism, it is no longer surprising that Diderot—or any of the French philosophes for that matter—attempted a moral recuperation of the passions. As Jonathan Israel writes, "For those aspiring to what Condorcet would eventually articulate clearly as an overturning *through* reason of authority, credulity, and tradition, in favor of liberty, toleration, equality, and a fully secular conception of the cosmos and humanity—a new materialist conception of human nature was crucial. From this perspective, the foregrounding of human sensuality and sensibility is not surprising"41—though, as a point of order, Diderot's optimism about the passions, and specifically the idea

Roe further notes that Diderot read Buffon in prison during his notorious three-month stay at Vicennes in 1749. Diderot later befriended Buffon, who was supposed to write the article "Nature" for the *Encyclopédie*, but never did. Instead, it was authored by the moderate D'Alembert.

<sup>41</sup> Jonathan Israel, *Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650–1750* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 504. Indeed, in retrospect it no longer seems a perfectly apt statement to say, as the famous Enlightenment scholar Ernst Cassirer does, "It sounds like a violent revolution when Vauvenargues in his *Introduction to the Knowledge of the Human Mind* (1746), says that the true nature of man does not lie in reason, but in the passions" (*The Philosophy of the Enlightenment* [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1951], 107). Cassirer is probably right only if we are thinking of the early modern lay reader, and probably wrong if speaking of the learned crowd.

of the passionate person, probably took root before his materialism. His very first published work was a translation of Shaftesbury's *Inquiry Concerning Virtue and Merit*, a work that was famous across Europe for arguing that virtue consists in an "economy of the passions," and was to become the fountain of all Scottish sentimentalism. And, in his notes to this translation, Diderot compared a man without passions to a musical instrument whose strings had been cut, or which never had any—a very Shaftesburian view.42

In any event, by the time he was engaged with the *Encyclopédie*, Diderot had clearly settled into a positive view of the passions. For example, his entry "Passions" argues that, even if our agency is sometimes subverted and made "passive" by very strong feelings, it is nevertheless through feelings or sentiments of desire and aversion, pleasure and pain that we come to call anything "good" or "evil" in the first place. Moreover, in the same entry Diderot allows for pleasurable feelings of the mind or imagination. These include pleasures that come by way of sensory experiences of art and nature, but also include those "only seized by the eyes of understanding, that is, those found in in universal truths, those that follow from general laws." More telling still, Diderot writes, "A third order of pleasures and pains are those affecting the heart which give rise in us to so many very different inclinations or *passions*. Their source is in the notion of *our perfection* or *our imperfection*, of our virtues and vices."

This last remark must be highlighted. For here we cross over from merely a recuperated role for the passions in morality (which could remain instrumental) to a bona fide conception of the passionate agent. Indeed, the last quote suggests that *moral* agency is at least partly *constituted* by passion. The moral agent has a certain sensibility—a sensible

<sup>42</sup> See Diderot, *Oeuvres complètes* (Paris: Garnier, 1875; reprinted Nendeln, Lichtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1966) 1:75 n. 1.

sentiment of joy in her perfection (i.e. in the fitting use of her capacities), and a sensible sentiment of pain in her imperfection. To this Diderot adds a complementary sensibility to the passions of others, namely, their pain and pleasure, sorrow and happiness, which he calls the "sensitivity to humankind."

To be clear, much more would need to be said to flesh out these barebones claims into a plausible, comprehensive account of human agency. And whether Diderot does this to our satisfaction, I shall not pretend to say. For my purposes, it suffices that he clearly does think moral agency is constituted (at least partly) by our passionate or affective capacities. And the reason this is enough is that our main question has always been only this: can Diderot's view of agency (complete or not) be linked to a view of human dignity?

## "I Am a Man": Diderot's Account of Human Dignity

To see the way Diderot builds the link to dignity, it helps first to make clear how the link *cannot* be derived: it cannot come from Diderot's suggestion that we have an original "sensitivity to humankind." To speak of such sensitivity brings to mind the widespread eighteenthcentury discussions of "sympathy"—that capacity to feel what others feel, especially their misery, and what today we usually call "empathy."43 But to say that humans are naturally sympathetic is a descriptive claim that, at best, might be marshaled to defend a natural human tendency to *care* for other humans. Thus, our natural sensitivity to the plight of other humans plausibly elicits or enhances our prosocial motives toward them. But it doesn't entail that we respect them, which is what we've said is required to substantiate a theory of dignity. Specifically, we need a concept akin to recognition-respect for an

<sup>43</sup> The concept was elaborated at length by Hume, Smith, and de Grouchy, to name a few who treated it explicitly. But also important was Rousseau's concept of a variant on sympathy, *pitié*. The best first address for the history of this concept in both ancient and modern thought is Eric Schliesser, ed., *Sympathy: A History* (New York: Oxford University Press, 2015).

unearned, normatively privileged status. So, does Diderot make this kind of connection?

Yes. But what is especially exciting is how he makes this connection: Diderot inserts his substantive notion of passionate agency into a Pufendorfian model of natural law. This is not obvious, largely because Diderot only rarely discusses Pufendorf explicitly.44 However, what is important is ultimately not where Diderot does mention Pufendorf, but where he does not. Thus, in his 1765 *Encyclopédie* entry "Hobbisme," we find this important passage:

If you follow Hobbes, you are convinced that laws and the formation of society have made men better, while if you follow Monsieur Rousseau, you believe instead that they have depraved him…. Different times, different circumstances, different philosophies. Both men were extreme. Between their two systems there is another which may convey the truth: in effect that, although the human condition is one of perpetual strife, man's goodness and wickedness remain constant, his happiness and suffering circumscribed by limits he cannot breach.45

The middle ground here, which Diderot says, "may convey the truth," must be Pufendorf. To see why, we must only ask, what establishes the limits we "cannot breach"? A survey of Diderot's practical philosophy makes the answer to this easy and certain: these limits are set by the "the general will"—that is, the will of the community. I don't have the space to explain carefully this crucial concept of Diderot's practical thought, but for our purposes, we need to grasp only this one crucial aspect: according to Diderot, the "general will" is manifested through participation in a community where there is reciprocal recognition of

<sup>44</sup> See the entry "Citoyen," in *Political Writings*, trans. and ed. by John Hope Mason and Robert Wokler (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 14–17.

<sup>45</sup> Diderot, "Hobbisme," in *Political Writings*, 27–28.

status between members of that community—*just as Pufendorf would have had it*.

That this must be Diderot's position is made clear in another entry, his "Droit Naturel" (Natural Right) of 1755. Diderot there confronts the pesky political question of social defection, by taking to task, in a kind of dialogue, an imagined challenger to the general will. As Diderot construes this challenger, he bucks the entire superstructure of the social contract in virtue of expressing his willingness to forgo his own fundamental right against harm—which the social contract provides him—just so that he may harm others. "I realize I bring terror and confusion to the human race," this man thus calls out, "but I must either be miserable or create misery for others, and no one is more dear to me than myself."46 Diderot then memorably remarks:

What then shall we reply to this violent interlocutor before smothering him? That everything he says may be reduced to the question of whether he acquires a right over the lives of others in forfeiting control over his own life to them; for he does not wish merely to be happy; he wishes also to be just and by his justice to ward off the ascription of "evil"; for otherwise we should have to shut him up without any reply.47

Diderot must be understood as arguing against Hobbes's claim that we are all the justifiable arbitrators of our rights. In particular, Hobbes is wrong to think that the starting point of deliberation is a place where all equally have a right to everything. Hobbes's mistake is to think that such a right follows from merely granting to everyone the right to preservation together with the right to judge the necessary means to that preservation. Diderot argues that we don't get a "right" out of this at all. For if we are genuinely cognizing

<sup>46</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," in *Political Writings*, 18.

<sup>47</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 19.

*rights*, then it must be the case that we already think, not merely that we want to be happy, but that we want to be *justly* happy. That is, if we are really in the conceptual "space" of rights-talk, then we can assume we want to choose the means to our happiness in a way that others will recognize the authority of our choices, which is to say, not resent those choices as evil or unjust.

Now, one might ask Diderot why he thinks that we want to be justly happy in the first place—that we want to be in the space of rights-talk? However, Diderot's reply in this memorable passage seems to be that such a question is insensible. Or rather, if it is sensible, then one reveals herself as truly unfit for society and thus justly suppressed by everyone else, her dissenting voice smothered, at least in effect. The upshot is a second bedrock assumption, this time of the equality of authority between all members of the community. One must either accept moral nakedness (and claim a "right" without grounding or justification), or one must assume an equal "authority" with all other persons. And this "choice"—really a normative injunction, given that one is already in community—holds for all members of the community. This is confirmed moments later when Diderot summarizes:

For an individual to know how far he ought to be a man, a citizen, a subject, a father, or a child, and when it befits him to live or die, he must address himself to the general will. It is for the general will to determine the limits of all duties. You have the most sacred *natural right* to everything that is not resisted by the whole human race…. Say to yourself often, "I am a man, and I have no other truly inalienable *natural rights* except those of humanity."48

At this point, the Pufendorfian argument in Diderot is manifest. According to Diderot, as for Pufendorf, the duty to respect other

<sup>48</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 20.

persons is based on the idea of assumed and thus unearned status, which assumption is justified by facts of sociability. In other words, Diderot follows Pufendorf in arguing that a person's moral status is manifested *through* participation in a community of reciprocal recognition of that status. Or, as Diderot put the point at the end of "Droit Naturel," albeit rather more cryptically, "Equity relates to justice as cause to its effect."49 What Diderot means is that justice only exists where equity of *status* is respected, that is, assumed. And of course, to say all this is already to say that the status in question is normatively privileged. After all, this status is what grounds the duty to respect others, and simultaneously draws the limits of my own rights. Thus it seems Diderot has a working concept of human dignity.

Two final questions must be answered. The first is just clarification: Why think Diderot's argument necessarily turns on a question of status? Couldn't the whole of it be construed simply as an argument for equity of right? No. To read Diderot this way would miss the spirit of "Droit Naturel" precisely because the entry purports to *explain* natural rights. Natural rights are ultimately what we can claim with authority, which authority is in turn defined as whatever we can claim that the general will will tolerate. And this tolerance is itself explained via a reference to status—albeit, in the sense of *shared and equal* status. Consider: According to Diderot, what is tolerated is what we can demand from others while still being allowed to remain "within them"—within the community, within humanity. And as we have seen, we can expect to be allowed so long as we *assume* our equal status, and thus that others have moral powers like ourselves. Taken altogether, we can claim with a "natural" authority only those rights that respect our status as one man—one human—among many. Hence, as I said, natural rights are explained by reference to status.50

<sup>49</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 21.

<sup>50</sup> Indeed, elsewhere Diderot makes explicit (and now unlike Pufendorf ) that there are no exceptions to this ultimate appeal to the general will—not morally anyway. Thus, in his entry "Citoyen," Diderot argues that even if the sovereign is relieved of a political duty to respect equal dignity, she is still subject to the moral demands of dignity: "In its public face, [the moral being of the sovereign] must never confront resistance." However, "In its private capacity [the moral being of the sovereign] may suffer such resistance on the part of individuals and may even succumb to it. Because this moral being has estates and responsibilities, and tenancies and tenants, etc. we must so to speak, distinguish the sovereign from the subject of sovereignty within it" (Diderot, "Citoyen," 16).

The second, more pressing, question is this: where is the tie back to the passionate person? That is, granting the first part of my reading that there is a Pufendorfian argument in Diderot's work for dignity qua unearned, normatively privileged status—one can still ask, does Diderot think that respecting a person's status is constitutively tied to acknowledging her not just as a rational agent, but also a passionate one?

It would be strange and bad for Diderot if it turned out that he did *not* think there was such a tie. For then his account of dignity would be radically disjoined from the conception of the passionate person we previously identified in his philosophy. Thankfully, it is clear enough that Diderot does draw a connection to the passionate person. To see this, we can simply follow Diderot's own lead; first, in "Droit Naturel":

But, you will ask, in what does this general will reside? Where can I consult it? … In the principles of prescribed law of all civilized nations; in the social practices of savage and barbarous peoples; in the tacit agreements obtaining amongst the enemies of mankind; and even in those two emotions—indignation and resentment which nature has extended as far as animals to compensate for social laws and public retribution.51

Why is the general will expressed in the principles of all civil societies? Because there are regularities in what all humans *desire*, and thus what they would take *joy* in and so demand you not to interfere with; because there are regularities in what they would shun as "evil," as well as what they would call "good," which, as we saw for Diderot, are

<sup>51</sup> Diderot, "Droit Naturel," 20 (original ellipsis).

denominations based on *sentiments* of desire and aversion, pleasure and pain. Or again, why is the general will expressed even in savage societies? Because absent positive law, there remain regularities in human nature—in or out of civil society—about the causes of *pleasure* and *pain, joy* and *misery, love* and *hate*. And so, assuming the general will is definitional of human agency for Diderot, this single passage implicates passionate principles of human nature in that notion of agency.

This connection between agency and passion is confirmed by Diderot's reflections on human nature in his *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville*—a fiery, anti-Colonial dialogue devoted in part to a defense of "savage" nature.52 Therein we find Diderot upending the familiar religious dogma that civil law and the law of nature should be patterned on religious laws, which are "engraved in our hearts." Specifically, Diderot rejects the claim that religious laws inform us of "men's eternal relations with another." Instead, he asserts a new view of what is engraved in the heart: "We have no more in common with other human beings at birth than an organic similarity of form, the same need, an attraction to the same pleasures, and a shared aversion to the same pains. These are the things which make man what he is, and which should form the basis of the morality suited to him."53 Here Diderot brings his materialist inflected view about passionate agency together with his view of natural law in just the way we would expect him to, if human dignity is constituted, substantively, by the passionate person.

This connection is further buttressed by Diderot's direct attacks on colonial racism in the *Supplément*, which seem to rely, at least partly, on this substantive notion of human dignity. Thus, speaking through the

<sup>52</sup> Diderot, *Supplément au Voyage de Bougainville*, in *Political Writings*, trans. and ed. John Hope Mason and Robert Wokler (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992), 31–75. The dialogue was inspired by Louis Antoine de Bougainville, who was a contemporary of Diderot and famous for being the first Frenchman to circumnavigate the earth. Bougainville published an account of his expeditions to various foreign lands, including Tahiti, in *Voyage autour du monde* (1771).

<sup>53</sup> Diderot, *Supplément*, 67.

voice of a Tahitian native who is addressing his imperious European invaders, Diderot writes:

This inhabitant of Tahiti, who you wish to ensnare like an animal, is your brother. You are both children of Nature. What right do you have over him that he does not have over you? You came; did we attack you? Have we plundered your ship? Did we seize you and expose you to the arrows of our enemies? Did we harness you to work with our animals in the fields? We respected our image in you.54

Surely this "Native" outcry isn't meant to be merely the expression of a rational claim by the Tahitians, for example, to have their "rights" respected. To say otherwise would be a baffling interpretation of Diderot's intent given the gravitas that imbues this passage, and indeed the whole stretch of text in which it appears, which stands as one of the more moving attacks on colonialism in the eighteenth century. Instead, this native outcry is manifestly meant to give voice to the anger, indignation, misery, sadness, and in a word, the passions of the Tahitians. In other words, it is the passions themselves—the way the Tahitians *feel* about their oppression—that Diderot is, at least partly, holding up as demanding respect. Indeed, running parallel to this point is the fact that Diderot explicitly blames his fellow Europeans for their lack of recognition *of* those passions: "With your unfeeling heart," the Tahitian further cries, "you can have no sense of pity and do not deserve any."55 And once we connect these Tahitian outcries to Diderot's account of the general will, what we end up with is a judgment on the European failure to recognize the will of native peoples, which "will" must be understood as expressed partly *in* their anger, indignation, misery, and sadness. That is, Diderot is accusing his fellow Europeans of failing to

respect the Tahitians not only as rational agents—agents who might well make rights claims—but also as *passionate* agents.

All this comes to a head when one of the Tahitians expresses his confusion over western Christian notions of God: "Don't you see that in your country you have confused something which cannot feel or think or desire or will; which one takes or leaves, keeps or sells, without it suffering or complaining, with a very different thing that cannot be exchanged or acquired; which *does* have freedom, will, desire; which has the ability to give itself up or hold itself back forever; which complains or suffers; and which *can never be an article of exchange* unless its character is forgotten and violence is done to its nature."56 Kant is famous for lauding human dignity as "beyond all price." But it would seem that Diderot made the point before him, albeit with this crucial difference: Diderot made the point part and parcel of a claim about passionate persons.

If there is any remaining doubt that Diderot's concept of dignity is based specifically on passionate agency, such doubt should be extinguished when we recall Diderot's allowance in "Droit Naturel," quoted earlier, for an appreciable general will even in nonhuman animals. For that allowance was made in virtue of the fact that nature has extended to nonhuman animals "those two emotions—indignation and resentment," "to compensate for social laws and public retribution."57 If this is true, then the notion of "status" we've been investigating in Diderot cannot depend entirely on the rational capacity to make claims. Diderot confirms this, ironically by explaining why animals do not have *equal* status:

If the status of animals were roughly equal to our own; if there were reliable means of communication between them and us; if they could transmit their feelings and thoughts to us clearly and come

to apprehend our own with equal certainty … we should have to summon them to it; and the case for *natural right* would no longer be pleaded before the bar of *mankind* but before that of all *animal kind*. But animals are separated from us by fixed and eternal barriers; and we are dealing here with a system of knowledge and ideas peculiar to the human species, arising from and forming its station in the world.58

I think this passage puts my interpretation of Diderot beyond doubt. But before stating why, let me grant outright that one might fairly contest whether Diderot is right about such "fixed and eternal" barriers. Thus, one might wonder, if animals get some claim on the normative space of general will in virtue of being feeling creatures of a certain kind, and, moreover, if we are sensitive to such feelings, then isn't it prima facie suspect to say these barriers are "fixed?" Worse still, one might reasonably worry that by conditioning *being* passionate on *expressing* passion in a certain way, as this passage does, Diderot is inviting classic "line drawing" problems that risk leaving out some humans, and, in particular, disabled persons or the very young. However, my task was merely to make the case that Diderot is a genuine protagonist in the second story of human dignity. And in this respect, I think this passage is conclusive. For, by making this comparison with nonhuman animals, Diderot reaffirms (1) that agency is constituted partly by feeling; (2) that this aspect of agency bears fundamentally on the question of moral status; and (3) that humans enjoy a *peculiar* status in this respect, namely, one with normative privilege. One can only marvel, then, at the fact that in this same passage, in the last line, Diderot joins Pufendorf in deploying the term "dignity" in its moralized sense—a fact that is obscured only by translation. Thus the last line in its original French reads, "qui émanent de sa dignité

et la constituent."59 Ironically, then, to translate this as "station in the world" (as the modern Cambridge edition does) might actually have been fitting for Diderot's own English readers. For that translation at least has the virtue of breaking from dignity's older, merit connotation of "elevated rank." Nevertheless, in the light of all I've said here, this translation seems crucially inapt for us today. From our contemporary perspective, Diderot really did mean *dignity*.
