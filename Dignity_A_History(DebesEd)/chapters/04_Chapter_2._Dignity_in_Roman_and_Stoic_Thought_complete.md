# Chapter 2: Dignity in Roman and Stoic Thought

*Miriam Griffin*

In his recent book *Dignity*, Michael Rosen writes: "To untangle the idea of dignity, the best way, I think, is to reach back to its roots, and these—like all concepts of significant interest in political life—are historical."[^1] But how historically deep are these roots? Given the obvious etymological connection of "dignity" with the Latin term *dignitas*, it seems sensible to ask if this Roman notion, which was originally based on merit, was somehow expanded by Roman writers to yield something like our contemporary notion of an unearned, distinctive, inalienable human value. Some Roman writers—those influenced by the tradition of Stoicism, like Cicero—already enjoy something of a reputation for exactly this. It thus makes sense to examine their views. We might also pursue a related witness to dignity—rights, given that the contemporary notion of human dignity is frequently used as a basis for the idea of human rights.

## Difficulties with the Enquiry

Three lexical problems confront us from the start. First, *dignitas* was a word that possessed many possible strands of meaning. As Rosen points out, we still make use of many of these strands.[^2] Here, however, our focus is on the contribution made by one possible strand to one important modern notion. We are searching for the roots of the idea of human dignity in the sense of a universal and inalienable property of human beings, which can serve as the foundation of basic human rights. We may find it, just as some prominent scholars like Martha Nussbaum have suggested. But, as will emerge, it is clearly not the central ancient meaning, or even a particularly common one. Which is to say, if it *is* there, no easy and straightforward lexical analysis will suffice.

Second, the reputed Stoic concept of dignity that those like Nussbaum highlight, and which figures in later Roman discussions of *dignitas*, opens up the question about vocabulary, both in Greek, the original language of Stoicism, and also in Latin. There is no Greek word that translates *dignitas* specifically. *Axiōma*—sometimes suggested as a candidate—is also the word used for *auctoritas* (the quality that gives one authority and influence). Nor is *axiōma* an important term in Stoic ethics, though it is one in logic, where it means "judgment" or "proposition." Therefore, we cannot expect to find the concept of dignity under that term (*axiōma*) in our Greek Stoic sources. We may well assume, however, that Panaetius, a Stoic philosopher of the Roman period and Cicero's Greek "source" for *On Duties*, had a word for the concept, unless all the passages in which *dignitas* occurs in that work were additions by Cicero (which is possible, of course). Possibly Panaetius used *timē* (usually translated as "honor"), since Aristotle, an author Panaetius admired, uses that term in the *Nicomachean Ethics* as the end of the life in politics, saying that it appears to depend on those who confer it and that men seek to be honored by men of practical wisdom on the ground of their virtue (1.5.1095b23–30). As we shall see, the notion of outside approval and of approval that is deserved both belong to the Latin *dignitas.*

Finally, the fullest source for the Roman sense of *dignitas* is, in fact, Cicero, who was particularly interested in philosophy. However, it is also a fact that we cannot tell how far his influence in this respect extended. Indeed, what evidence we have suggests his interest in the moral sense of *dignitas* was, and remained, unusual. Of course, given that the eighteenth-century thinker Immanuel Kant is often taken to be the main architect of the modern meaning of dignity, and he was particularly influenced by *On Duties*, as has also been argued by Nussbaum and others, then perhaps the unusualness of Cicero's formulation is of concern only to historians.

Given these lexical difficulties (especially the first two), it is clear that we must extend our enquiry beyond the word *dignitas* to related concepts. But this carries the great danger of taking isolated statements out of context and stretching the ideas in an untypical direction from that in which we want them to go. This problem will surface often in the following discussion, but here I shall give one striking example. Stoics and Roman moralists think in terms of *officia*, obligations or duties or functions that our nature, properly understood, imposes on us, and whose fulfillment will lead to flourishing, or the *vita beata* ("happy life"). The entitlements and rights of those at the receiving end of our actions are far less prominent in their thinking than the obligations of the doers, and even the obligations of the recipients. So, in our enquiry, we are swimming against the current.

## The Different Nuances of *Dignitas*

Let us start with the primary sense of the term *dignitas*, particularly as it took shape in the late Republic, which is the period for which we have most literary evidence.

*Dignitas* is an attribute signifying a certain standing or rank in the community; it rests on a particular office or status, and on the prestige that accrues to its holder. It includes the idea of worthiness and the respect inspired by that worthiness. It is long term, and it is inheritable by descendants. But it is neither inalienable nor unmerited.

It is an outward-looking quality, in that it depends on the view taken of one by others, and it also comprises outward or perceivable behavior. As Seneca was to say, (*Tranq. an*. 1.3), *dignitas* is one of the virtues "that work to make an impression" and "depend on the judgement of others" (*quae in speciem laborant; quidquid ad alienum suffragium venit*). It is, probably, etymologically connected with *decus*, comely and fitting appearance.[^3]

*Dignitas* is inherently comparative. Thus, the individual or collective to which it attaches is understood to be superior to other individuals or collectives. The *dignitas* of a *gens* implies that family's superiority over other families. The *dignitas* of the senate implies the senate's superiority over other orders, such as the equestrian order. The *dignitas* of the equestrian order implies its superiority over the rest of the citizenry. The *dignitas* of the Roman people implies its superiority over other peoples. When *human* dignity as such is mentioned, it is in comparison to animals and to the other elements of creation. But it is not only human beings who can possess *dignitas*. Vines can; houses can; dogs can; and the virtues themselves possess it (*Tusc. Disp.* 5.85; *Fin.* 2.51).

This Roman sense of *dignitas,* merited, outward looking, and comparative, fitted admirably with the political character of the late Republic, which was held, in the Optimate tradition to which Cicero subscribed, to combine equality before the law with grades of *dignitas* (*gradus dignitatis*). As Cicero says (*Rep.* 1.69, 2.40): no one was deprived of suffrage, but the majority of votes was in the hands of those to whom the welfare of the state was most important. The mixed constitution was based on distributive justice, using geometrical proportion, unlike democracy, which used arithmetical proportion (1.43, 1.53).[^4] The tradition about grades of *dignitas* survived the Republic: it turns up in a letter of Pliny to a provincial governor, written a century and a half after Cicero's *De Re Publica*, where Pliny urges the governor, in his administration of justice, to go on preserving the distinctions of rank and *dignitas*; "Once these are thrown into confusion and destroyed," he writes, "nothing is more unequal than the resultant 'equality'" *Ep.* 9.5). To look ahead for a minute, this conception of *dignitas* also fits with the Stoic conception of justice, taken over from Aristotle's distributive justice, that is, a disposition to distribute things *kat'axian*, or "according to the recipients'" worth (*SVF* 3.267, *hexis aponemētikē tou kat'axian hekastōi*). Cicero in fact renders this Stoic definition of justice as *habitus animi* … *suam cuique tribuens dignitatem* (*Inv.* 2.160, cf. *Off.* 1.42).

If we want to see this Roman political sense of *dignitas* in the raw, however, we can turn to other Romans more representative than Cicero. Caesar urges his troops, while waiting at Ravenna, before crossing the Rubicon,

> to defend from his enemies the reputation and *dignity* of the commander under whose leadership they have conducted the state's business with unfailing good fortune for nine years, fought many successful battles, and pacified the whole of Gaul and Germany. (*BC* 1.7)

And Pompey, in negotiating with him, tells him that he should lay aside his anger "for the sake of the commonwealth" in keeping with his *dignitas* (*pro sua dignitate*) (1.8.3). Catiline, according to Sallust, writes a letter to a man of similarly high birth,

> Maddened by wrongs and insults, since I was robbed of the fruits of my toil and industry and was unable to attain to a position of *dignitas*, … because I saw the unworthy elevated to honors, … in order to preserve what *dignitas* I have left, I have adopted measures honorable enough for my situation. (*Bellum Catilinae* 35)[^5]

The emphasis for all three ambitious Romans is on personal achievement and the reputation and standing acquired by it.

But Cicero, too, could stand on his *dignitas*, and his political ideal of *otium cum dignitate* combined domestic tranquility, that is, the maintenance of the established form of republican government, with the worthy standing (*dignitas*) of the best people (*Pro Sestio* 98). Cicero spells out the strands of the term *dignitas* in a famous letter written during the civil war between Caesar and Pompey. It is addressed to Cn. Plancius, a Pompeian in exile, during Caesar's Spanish campaign of 45, which was to end in his final victory (*Fam*. 4.14.1). Plancius had congratulated Cicero on maintaining his former *dignitas*:

> Well, if *dignitas* means to feel loyal to the commonwealth and to have one's sentiments approved by good men, then I do maintain my *dignitas*. But if it consists in the power to translate those loyal feelings into action, or even to speak freely in their defense, not a vestige of *dignitas* is left to us.

*Dignitas* for Cicero should incorporate *auctoritas*, the ability to use one's authority and influence to get things done; as he says in *De Inventione*

2.166, "*Dignitas* is honourable *auctoritas*, deserving of respect, honor, and reverence."[^6] This he, and his peers, had lost under Caesar's dictatorship. But the loyal sentiments about the commonwealth that Pompey had urged on Caesar, Cicero still had, as well as the approval of men.

Though, when speaking to Plancius, Cicero concentrates on patriotism, which often seems, for an aristocratic Roman, to be the supreme moral good, something broader seems to be involved in Cicero's famous comment to Atticus (*Att*. 7.11.1) about Caesar's invasion of Italy: "And he says he is doing all this for the sake of his *dignitas.* Where is *dignitas* except where there is *honestas*?" *Honestas* here is clearly "moral good," since it was glossed, in the sentence above, as Good (*to kalon*). Cicero in fact accuses Caesar here of crimes (*scelera*), albeit political crimes. But the link of *dignitas* with morality is not confined to Cicero. The younger Scipio, in the second century bc, is credited with saying, "From innocence arises dignity; from dignity honor" (*ex innocentia nascitur dignitas, ex dignitate honor*) (Malcovati, *ORF*, p. 241, no. 22),[^7] and Caesar's associate Cornelius Balbus links *dignitas* with *fides* (good faith), in urging Cicero to remain neutral in the civil war between Caesar and Pompey (*Att.* 9.7A). Nonetheless, Cicero probably gives the term more of a moral and philosophical tinge than most of his political friends would have allowed it.[^8] Thus, in the oratorical treatise *On the Classification of Rhetoric* (*De Partitione Oratoria*), addressed to his son, he says, of persons who are humane and cultivated, that they put *dignitas* above utility, which involves giving first place to "praise, honor, glory good faith, justice, and all the forms of virtue" (90). And in his philosophical works he is very prone to ascribe *dignitas* to virtue in general (*Tusc. Disp.* 5.85), to the *honestum* (*Fin.* 3.21), as well as to particular virtues (*Fin.* 2.51), and Seneca follows him (*Ben.* 4.16.3). This is an allusion to the etymological connection of *dignitas* with *decus* and goes with the Stoic idea of *to prepon* or, in Latin, *decorum*, the essence of which is that what is seemly is honorable, and what is honorable is seemly (*Off.* 1.93; cf. *Fin.*2.47). Seneca spells out the visual attraction of virtue and ascribes it to Providence: "Of all the benefits that we have from Nature this is the greatest: the fact that Virtue causes her light to penetrate into the minds of all; even those who do not follow her, see her" (*Ben.* 4.17.4).

## *Dignitas* with Philosophical Overtones

This brings us to *dignitas* as it features in Roman philosophy of Stoic inspiration. Cicero wrote about Stoic ethics systematically in two works: *On Ends* (*De finibus*) and *On Duties* (*De officiis*). In these works, he uses the term *dignitas* in the senses we have outlined, but in *On Duties* he also associates the term with the dignity of human beings *in general*, which rests on their superiority to other creatures. As Cancik observed, this is the first appearance we have of the formula "the dignity of man."[^9] It occurs in two contexts:

> 1. Discussion of the duties that follow from the specific virtue that Cicero likes to call *decorum* or seemliness, that is, the fourth of the cardinal virtues, usually called temperance or moderation.  
> 2. Discussion of how to practice liberality, which falls under the virtue of justice.

## *Duties of Decorum*

In *On Duties*, after a very complex discussion of *decorum* as a characteristic inseparable from virtue in general (as we saw previously) and of *decorum* as the fourth virtue of moderation and restraint, Cicero turns to the duties or obligations that arise from this specific *decorum.* Prominent in this discussion is the doctrine of the four *personae*, the word *persona* (meaning "role") being borrowed from the world of drama and rhetoric, where characters need to be assigned words and deeds appropriate to their role. So the four *personae* determine our duties, of which the first two concern us here. Nature imposes on us, first, a role consonant with universal human nature, which has made us possessors of reason and thus superior to other creatures (1.97, 1.107). The second *persona* we are given is that of our individual natures, our temperament and talents. Cicero cautions, "For we must act in such a way that we attempt nothing contrary to universal nature, that is, the first *persona*; but, while conserving that, let us follow our own nature" (1.110).

In discussing the superiority of human beings, the first *decorum*, Cicero is keen to emphasize that this is a status we must live up to. "If we wish to reflect on the excellence and *dignitas* in our nature, we shall realize how dishonorable it is to sink into luxury and live a soft and effeminate lifestyle, but how honorable it is to live thriftily and strictly, with self-restraint, severely and soberly" (1.106). So we should give our bodies the care needed for health, not for pleasure, which is what mere instinct leads animals to pursue. If a person is too susceptible to pleasure, he will conceal his inclination, because of a sense of shame—that is, provided he is not actually one of the beasts, "for," Cicero says, "some are men, not in fact, but in name only" (1.105). Human beings then do not have an *automatic* and *inalienable* dignity. Nature gives them a role to play, and they must strive to play that role.

Let us now spread the net wider, to include discussions where the actual word *dignitas* does not feature, but which are important for this Stoic notion of humanity. Before returning to Cicero, it is illuminating to look at the letter of Seneca (*Ep.* 41) in which, according to Nussbaum,[^10] he is eloquent in his description of the beauty of the moral substance of humanity in each person, and of the attitudes of quasi-religious awe with which he is inspired by his contemplation of a human being's rational and moral purpose. Nussbaum omits to mention that Seneca is describing, not any ordinary man, but the sage. He points out that, just as we are sensible of the presence of the deity in unusually tall trees, in mighty rivers, and in exceptionally deep pools, so "If you see a man who is unterrified in the midst of dangers, untouched by desires, happy in adversity, peaceful amid the storm, who looks down upon men from a higher plane, and views the gods on a footing of equality, will not a feeling of reverence for him steal over you?" "When a soul rises superior to other souls, when it is under control, when it passes through every experience as if it were of small account, when it smiles at our fears and at our prayers, it is stirred by a force from heaven" (par. 4). Toward the close of the letter (pars. 8–9), Seneca says, "For a human being is a reasoning animal. Therefore, a human being's highest good is attained if he has fulfilled the good for which nature designed him at birth. And what is it that this reason demands of him? The easiest thing in the world—to live in accordance with his own nature. But this is turned into a hard task by the general madness of humankind: we push each other into vice."

Nussbaum suggests that this letter influenced Kant. In that case, it must be a passage like the page in the *Groundwork to the Metaphysics of Morals* (*Ak.* 4.439–40) that, according to Rosen,[^11] contains a minor aspect of Kant's use of the term "dignity": here, "Rather than dignity being an intrinsic quality of all human beings in so far as they carry the moral law within themselves, it is a feature of those who follow the moral law's command." This is the dignity of the person "who fulfils all his duties."[^12]

The superiority of human nature does, however, result, for the Stoics, in a social bond involving all men. For reason is shared only by gods and human beings, and it is a bond between them. Since right reason is law and those who share law share justice, they are members of the same *civitas* (*On the Laws* 1.22). More exactly, we are citizens of the universe *quasi unius Urbis* ("as it were, of a single city)" (*On the Laws* 1.61; *On Ends* 3.64). This is a metaphysical community comprising all rational beings, gods as well as humans, meaning all human beings, whether or not they are virtuous.[^13] The emphasis in the Roman Stoics is on the bond between humans (e.g., *Off.* 1.100, 3.27–28)—though the bond is sanctioned by the gods (Marcus 10.36.2; Sen. *Ep.* 95.52–54), because that is where practical obligations arise. As Cicero puts it in *On Duties* 3.27, "If nature prescribes that a human being should be concerned for a human being, *whoever he may be*, for the very reason that he is a human being, it is necessary, according to the same nature, that what is beneficial to all is something common" (emphasis added). In the same work, Cicero adopts as a *formula* or rule of procedure, against which every act must be measured, "For one person to take something from another, and to increase one's own advantage at the cost of another's disadvantage, is more contrary to nature than death, than poverty, than pain, than anything else that may happen to his body or to his external possessions" (3.21, cf. 3.27). "This principle is the tightest bond of the fellowship of the human race" (3.28).

Rosemary Wright and Richard Sorabji have suggested that Cicero's emphasis, both in *On Ends* and here, is closer to modern conceptions of human rights than most Stoic texts.[^14] As Sorabji says, the emphasis is on the recipient, not just on the material for the agent's exercise of virtue; hence "a little more like an end in itself," in that a right imposes a duty on agents because of something about the recipients. But he rightly urges caution, because the Stoics still devalued material things, regarding them merely as "indifferents" (some positive, some negative, and some purely indifferent), so that our main duty to other human beings, according to Cicero, seems to be teaching them morality (*Fin.* 3.65; *Leg.* 1.33). In fact Seneca, while emphasizing that one can serve humankind either as a citizen of one's own state or as a citizen of the world state, says that the latter service consists mostly in philosophical contemplation (*Otio* 4, 6.4.5). Moreover, the Stoics thought that Providence has already ensured a benign condition of humankind, so that great strides in social improvement are not to be sought. A key example of this is that, although the Stoa did not think there were slaves by nature (*SVF* 3.352), slavery being a condition imposed by fortune (*Off.* 1.41), they did not go beyond preaching good treatment for slaves. By contrast a UN resolution of 1986 prescribed that instruments of human rights should not only "derive from the inherent dignity and worth of the human person" but "provide realistic and effective implementation machinery."

There are other ideas connected with the Stoic notion of the social bond that are relevant to our enquiry. Humans have a "social instinct," the Stoics claimed, which has been implanted by providential nature, in order to compensate for humankind's relative weakness and its lack of protective covering or natural weapons, like claws or horns. The mechanism by which nature has instilled the social instinct is *oikeiōsis*, usually translated as "appropriation." This is making one's own, or coming to treat as belonging to oneself, a widening circle of people, starting with one's own person, extending first to one's offspring and relatives, then to the members of one's community, then to one's fellow countrymen, and finally to the whole human race, so that the mere fact of their common humanity means that no person feels alien to another (*Fin.* 3.63). Cicero and Seneca like to allude to the famous line of the comic poet Terence, "I am a man and think nothing human alien to me" (*homo sum, humani nil a me alienum* 

*puto: Heautontimorumenos*, 77). Hierocles circa 100 ad (L-S 57 G) set this out as a system of concentric circles, enjoining us to draw the circles further and further toward the center. The idea is to reduce the sense of distance in all our relationships with other people, and to reflect this in our behavior toward each other. However, these other relationships are still there and are still important. Thus Cicero in *On Duties* 1.160 says, of the obligations that fall under the "social virtue" (as he calls "justice"), that it is not difficult to see which should take precedence over another. First, duties are owed to the gods, then to our country, then to our parents and "down the scale to the others."[^15] No reference is made in any of these lists (see also 1.53) to humankind as a whole. But in *On Ends* 5.65, spoken by the representative of Antiochus's Old Academy (whose ethical views are close to Stoicism), not only are friendships and neighbors inserted between relations and *cives*, but the list extends beyond fellow citizens, first to allies and friends of our city, and finally to the whole sweep of the human race (*totius gentis humanae complexus*), just as it does in Hierocles's circles. Justice is said both to give each his own and to maintain that human solidarity and alliance with generosity and equity.

*On Duties* is a work that gives priority to obligations to the *res publica*, so nothing is allowed to trump that. But, even in this passage in *On Ends*, the allusions to giving each his own make it clear that our obligations to these groups are proportional, not equivalent (cf. below on *Off.* 1.42). In *On Duties* Cicero will explicitly say, "The fellowship between human beings and their common bonding will best be preserved if, the closer someone is to you, the more kindness (*benignitas*) you confer on him" (1.50).[^16] In *On Ends* 3.64 Cicero is a bit more generous: he goes so far as to make Cato, the Stoic spokesman, say that the traitor to his country does not deserve *greater* reprobation than the man who betrays the common advantage or security for the sake of his own advantage and security.

## *How to Practice Liberality*

The ranking of obligations in *On Duties* concerns justice, and all the lists, except the one mentioning the gods, occur in Cicero's discussion of beneficence, a subcategory of justice. This brings us to the second context in which human dignity is mentioned. At the start of his discussion of beneficence, the term *dignitas* occurs in the advice that kindness (*benignitas*) should be bestowed upon each person according to his *dignitas*, for that is fundamental to justice, to which all these matters should be referred (*Off.* 1.42).[^17] Cicero spells out what choosing "according to standing" means here (1.45): we should consider the character of the person on whom the benefit is conferred, looking for indications of virtue but not imposing too high a standard (1.45–46); the person's attitude toward us, looking for affection that goes with reliable goodwill (1.47); and, finally, the person's past services to us and the degree of fellowship with us (1.47–50). This is not a matter of *dignitas* in the sense of rank or social standing, but it clearly relates to merit and worth in a particular relationship, not to any quality that all men have in common. Cicero does say that we should help the poor, but only "other things being equal" (1.49: *si cetera paria sunt*). In other words, having screened possible recipients for *dignitas* in the sense just described, we choose the poorest of those who qualify.

Cicero does, however, think that we have some obligations to members of the fellowship of the entire human race (1.50: *universi generis humani societas*), not only the negative one of the *formula*—not to harm another human being for our own advantage—but also positive obligations to show people the way if they are lost, and to provide them with fire and water. Cicero's conception of these obligations is very restricted though. Quoting the poet Ennius:

> A man who kindly shows the path to someone who is lost lights another's light, so to speak, from his own.

For his own shines no less because he has lit another's. (313–15 Jocelyn)

Cicero puts great emphasis on the last line, saying of the poet, "With this one instance, he advises us that if any assistance can be provided without detriment to oneself, it should be given even to a stranger" (1.51). The limitation "without detriment to oneself " is justified on the ground that the resources of individuals are small, but the mass of those in need is infinitely great. If we accept the limitation on general liberality, we shall still be able to be liberal to those close to us (1.52).

Cicero even accepts that there can be exceptions to applying the *formula* about not serving one's own advantage by disadvantaging another human being. If a good person is dying of cold, can he steal clothes from a monstrous tyrant? The answer is yes, because tyrants have put themselves outside the bonds of human fellowship, so it is honorable to rob him, and indeed to kill him (3.32). (Cicero was writing in the shadow of Caesar's assassination, which is never far from his thoughts in *On Duties*.) Even more telling is his answer to the question, "If a sage is dying of hunger can he steal food from another person, if he is a useless person?" The answer here is more complex: if the sage steals the food for his own benefit out of self-love, then he will have acted inhumanly and against the law of nature, but if he takes the food for the reason that he is the kind of person to bring great benefit to the fellowship of mankind if he remained alive, that is not a matter for rebuke (3.30–31).

Seneca too is keen to emphasize discrimination in giving benefits. In his treatise of that name, he emphasizes that we should choose as recipients those who will respond with gratitude (*Ben.* 1.10.5). But we should do something for those who we think will be, or even know have been, ungrateful. "For example, if I shall be able to restore to someone his sons by rescuing them from danger without any risk to myself, I shall not hesitate to do so." Seneca goes on to say that he will defend a deserving person (*dignum*), even at the cost of his life, but even an undeserving person he will rescue from robbers by uttering a cry (clearly at no risk to himself ), in order to save a human being.

Later on in *On Benefits*, he returns to the question of ungrateful recipients (4.29). Here he is asked if we will not give an ungrateful person advice when he is perplexed, nor a drink of water, nor show him the way when he is lost. Seneca now makes it clear that these minimal services and others, like tossing a person a coin or giving him a light, are not *benefits*, however useful they may be at the time, because they are too trivial and because they are bestowed carelessly, not with the thought that the recipients are worthy. "We are giving," he concludes, "not to a human being, but to humanity" (*non homini damus, sed humanitati*).

We recognize here the minimal services that Cicero had mentioned. They occur again in Seneca's *Letter* 95.51–52, where the general argument is that honorable conduct and the happy life cannot be achieved by precepts alone: we need to know the underlying doctrines, in order to interpret the precepts properly and know how to apply them. So, in dealing with other human beings, precepts can tell us to refrain from bloodshed, or to help a shipwrecked sailor, or to point out the way to a wanderer, or to share a crust with the starving, but they do not cover everything that we should give or withhold. Instead, Seneca produces his own *formula* for our duty:

> All that you behold, that which comprises the divine and the human, is one; we are the parts of one great body. Nature produced us related to each other, since she created us from the same source and to the same end. She engendered in us mutual affection and made us sociable. She established fairness and justice; according to her ruling it is more wretched to commit than to suffer injury. Through her orders, let our hands be ready for all that need to be helped.

He then quotes the famous lines of Terence and ends, "Let us possess things in common; for birth is ours in common." We can compare this to Cicero's "One should treat common goods as common and private goods as one's own" (*Off.* 1.20), and if, in the prohibition on doing injury, we recognize Cicero's *formula*, we also register in Seneca's *formula* that Seneca wants us to go further, and to be ready to give help wherever it is needed.

Again, here we may seem close to the idea of recipients receiving things by right of being human, but we need to consider what response Seneca's recipients are expected to give. Seneca thinks that some form of gratitude is expected, even when one is in receipt of communal benefits, where one is not chosen as an individual recipient, but only not excluded as a member of a group (*Ben.* 6.18–19). However, if a benefit is directed at one person and incidentally works to the advantage of someone else, only the former owes gratitude. Thus if one saves a son's life, the benefit was given to the son, though the father may be so delighted that he wishes to give something—not because he is under an obligation to do so, not as an act of gratitude, but because he wants to confer a benefit himself as an act of justice (i.e., giving to a worthy person).

In 5.20.4–6 Seneca deals with the difficult question of burying the corpse of an unknown person, whom one does not recognize. Clearly, this cannot be a benefit to the corpse, who will be unaware of the act. It can be a benefit to his son, but only if the person burying the corpse recognized it as the son's father and intended to render a service to the son by performing for him a customary and necessary duty. Otherwise, the act is done out of pity and humanity, sentiments that could lead the person to hide away anyone's dead body.[^18] There is no one indebted for his doing what he did—he was being *humanus in publicum*, "humane" or "in the public interest."

Does this act of humanity, falling outside the exchange of benefit and gratitude, imply a right? It seems to me closer to *that* notion than to Michael Rosen's idea that burying an anonymous corpse is a duty expressive of respect for humanity, and, since we also are human, "fundamentally a duty towards ourselves."[^19]

Then again, there are perhaps traces of the idea of rights when *dignitas* is coupled with verbs like *postulare* (to demand or claim). So Cicero will say to his patrician friend Manlius Torquatus, who asks about his own chances of pardon in 45 (*Fam.* 6.1.2), that Caesar has up to now been more unjust than your *dignitas* demanded, or as Shackleton-Bailey translates it, "than your personal eminence made incumbent." Again, Cicero says of a friend he has recommended, "I am not surprised that you value our friend Furnius as highly as his own *humanitas* and *dignitas* demand," translated by Shackleton-Bailey with "as highly as his own goodness and high standing deserve" (*Fam*. 10.1.4 in 44 bc to Plancus). But these cases, we observe, even if they approach the idea of "rights," attach it to the primary Roman meaning of *dignitas* as social standing, not the worth of a human being per se.

I close with a passage in Cicero's speech in defense of Murena (1.2), where he speaks of the *dignitas* of the *res publica* and what it demands. Speaking of the traditional election prayer that the consuls make for the good fortune of the successful candidates, their successors, Cicero suggests that the prayer "contains as much force and religious power as the *dignity of the commonwealth demands*" (emphasis added). I suspect that, for the Romans, the *res publica*, with its *dignitas*, came nearer to having rights than any single human being.

[^15]:  At 1.58 he omits the gods, because he is speaking of providing material necessities, and Cicero gives priority to our country, then our parents, next our children and our household, then other relations. 
[^16]:  This follows the definition of justice, as Cicero gives it in *On Invention* 2.161: *habitus animi communi utilitate conservata suam cuique tribuens dignitatem*. In Marcus Aurelius 3.11 we find the combination of the idea of treating someone justly and kindly in accordance with the natural law of companionship with the notion of giving the person what is deserved or appropriate (*kat'axian*) out of the material things that are positive indifferents (though not goods).

[^18]:  It is important to remember that pity is not a good motive for a Stoic (see Seneca's *De Clemetia I*). So the social instinct does not lead us to have this feeling. We help fellow humans out of virtue that includes concern for the communal welfare.
