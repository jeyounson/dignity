# **[Self-Respect under Conditions](#page-8-0)  of Oppression**

#### *Serene J. Khader*

Oppressive social arrangements, by definition, subordinate people. Such arrangements do not merely diminish the regard people in dominant groups have for the oppressed. They also threaten to damage oppressed people's self-regard. Here, I offer an account of how oppression threatens the self-respect of its victims that suggests that their self-regarding duties are not duties of noncompliance, as they are often thought to be. I argue that the demands of anti-oppressive theorizing and close attention to how oppression threatens self-respect militate against the idea that the oppressed have self-regarding duties not to comply with oppressive norms, and in favor of the idea that they have self-regarding duties to develop counterhegemonic normative perspectives. We need an account of the self-regarding duties of the oppressed that avoids victim-blaming and placing undue burdens on the oppressed and that understands the contours of the social world in which oppression operates—one in which structural double binds make compliance with oppressive norms a requirement for oppressed agents' pursuit of their own projects, in which degrading self-concepts are the ones most available in the dominant culture, and one in which oppressed people nonetheless form their own systems of meaning. A duty to develop a counterhegemonic normative perspective is consistent with these desiderata, and a duty of noncompliance is not.

Typical of the choice situations of oppressed people are double binds that make all available courses of action self-undermining. Though this fact is often overlooked, oppressed individuals face incentives to comply with norms that treat their groups unfairly. Two examples, to which I will refer in the body of the chapter, will preliminarily illustrate the idea:

*Shreya*: Shreya1 is a woman of color attorney who is routinely assigned office "housework" tasks, such as taking notes, buying the office presents, and bringing coffee to other attorneys. Shreya performs some of these tasks because "it seem[s] like saying no would not be perceived well" (Williams and Dempsey 2014: 70). Shreya's assessment of the situation is consistent with data suggesting that women are professionally punished for violating norms of feminine behavior. (Bowles et al. 2007)

*Chloe*: Chloe repeatedly consents to unwanted sex with her partner to avoid the "major arguments" that result when she refuses sex. She describes the situation as: "not actually being forced to have sex, but sometimes saying yes when I didn't really want to. . .the argument standing out as the most unpleasant thing. Things like actually being called a fucking bitch and having the door slammed. And trying to always explain that it didn't mean that I didn't care because I didn't want to have sex, but never succeeding." (Gavey 2005)

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Because such double binds are persistent and relatively ubiquitous in the lives of oppressed individuals, and because they typically attach real costs to refusal to comply with oppressive norms, oppressive norm compliance can, for oppressed individuals, be self-interested, and a way of treating their own projects as valuable. It may seem that such self-interested oppressive norm compliance requires treating the norms as true or acceptable, but I will suggest below that what I call the "variegation of the public" allows compliance to be compatible with a shared counterhegemonic normative perspective, both in individual acts and over a lifetime. In the first section of the essay, I describe how oppression structures individual option sets such that noncompliance often entails costs to both well-being and self-respect. Next, I ask how, under these conditions, oppressed agents can cultivate self-respect. I argue that oppressed people must cultivate a counterhegemonic normative perspective but that the actions through which such a counterhegemonic perspective is cultivated are best understood as a subset of noncompliant acts. I also show that communities of oppressed people mitigate the threats to self-respect posed by oppression and allow oppressed people to cultivate public self-respecting attitudes. Third, I contrast my discussion of the self-regarding duties of the oppressed with contemporary arguments that take self-respect to require noncompliance with oppressive norms. I suggest that these alternative arguments are complicit in victim-blaming and prescribing action that gets in the way of ending oppression, as well as overspecifying the self-regarding duties of the oppressed. Two remarks about the essay's scope will also be useful before I proceed. First, the essay emphasizes duties of recognition self-respect that is, the type of self-respect associated with seeing oneself as equal to others. Second, the essay does not take a stance about whether oppressed people have other-regarding duties not to comply with oppressive norms.2

### **1. Double Binds and the Costs of Noncompliance**

Oppression often reduces agents' options such that no available behavior straightforwardly expresses self-respect. The widespread idea that *compliance* with oppressive norms does not express self-respect is relatively easy to motivate. Oppressive norms demand behavior that perpetuates the low status of the oppressed. The oppression-compliant agent may thus seem not to appreciate her own entitlement to equal standing. If she did, the argument goes, she would demand that others recognize it. Consider Chloe. She stops trying to persuade her husband that she has the same right to refuse sex that he does. It may seem that Chloe has given up on the view that she has rights, that she has internalized oppression and denies that women deserve sexual autonomy.3 Thomas Hill famously describes oppressed people who accept inferior treatment because they believe they deserve it as paragons of servility (Hill 1995).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

But the claim that Chloe fails to appreciate her own rights does not require a claim about internalization. Kant's own remarks about servility are far less generous than Hill's. According to Kant, our seeking of ends must always occur with "consciousness of [our] sublime moral disposition" (Kant 1996: 187 [6:435]). Doing what others ask when they subordinate us *just is* refusing to acknowledge our own sublimity—regardless of how we feel about the demand. Kant is fully aware that we can sometimes benefit from accepting subordination. Yet he seems to take acquiescence in it to, by definition, involve holding ourselves to a "low standard" set by our "animal nature" (Kant 1996: 187 [6:435]). Taking a position less extreme than Kant's, Bernard Boxill argues that an agent who complies with oppressive norms over a lifetime compromises her self-respect by denying herself evidence that she affirms her own equality (Boxill 1976). Self-respecting people cannot know that they do not accept oppressive norms unless they express this commitment in action.

Though claims abound that oppressive norm compliance is self-disrespecting, little has been said about the downsides of the alternative. This failure to theorize the downside of noncompliance is surprising since oppressed agents face impoverished options, and do so characteristically. Oppressive conditions systematically disadvantage members of certain groups and benefit others (Frye 1983). The oppressed individual has options available to her, but her option set is both worse than that of the individual dominant group member and engineered to perpetuate this disparity. In Frye's words, oppression is "immobilizing" because all available options expose the agent to "penalty, censure, or deprivation" (Frye 1983: 2). Her example concerns the sexual choices available to young women. They can be sexually active and be perceived as unrapeable because of their ostensibly insatiable desire. Or they can refrain from sexual activity and be seen as unrapeable because of their ostensible need to have their frigidity or lesbianism corrected. There are options, but each of them subjects the agent to some type of harm and renders her worse off than members of the dominant group. Frye terms such situations "double binds."

I agree with Frye that oppressed agents face double binds. I add to Frye's claim that all courses of action are unacceptable that all also prevent the agent from unequivocally expressing self-respect. To see why, we need greater clarity about how oppression affects agents' abilities to pursue well-being. Social expectations mediate all agents' access to goods constitutive of well-being; for instance, in capitalist societies, all people must do work which their societies value to access income. However, as I have argued elsewhere (Khader 2014; 2017), the conditions of social recognition for oppressed people have a particular character; they demand self-subordination. Like men who are lawyers, Shreya has to meet certain social expectations to be perceived as a good colleague. However, the standards of *feminine* and *racialized* behavior she must meet detract from her ability to have a successful legal career, whereas analogous masculine and white expectations promote career success. She must clean up after others, socially lubricate meetings, appear non-threatening, and so on, where, for example, a white man might be expected to be assertive—an expectation that promotes the view that he is "tough enough" to be a good lawyer.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

To put the point more generally: because well-being for oppressed agents is often contingent on self-subordinating behavior, it is often objectively self-interested to comply with oppressive norms. Indeed, compliance is often the *most* welfaremaximizing action available. Shreya faces a choice between being seen as a good colleague and complying with sexist and racist norms and being seen as a bad colleague and violating them. Of course, Shreya would be better off if she, and women of color in general, were not expected to do the firm's housework. But note that Shreya is usually unable to change the expectation through acts of noncompliance. Violating the expectation is unlikely to prevent her from being judged according to it.4

This only shows that not complying with oppressive norms imposes well-being costs on agents, and my thesis is about costs to self-respect. However, it follows from the idea that oppression compliance is often the best means of access to well-being that compliance is often the best thing an agent can do to achieve the aims she desires in life. This is true in cases where her life plan is obviously aligned with recognition self-respect; when what she wants is what the dominant group has. Shreya may think she is just as deserving of success in law as white men, and as a result may decide to do everything in her power to make partner—even if it means buying the office presents and making coffee. Michele Moody-Adams (1993) argues that self-respect combines a conviction and a desire: the conviction that developing one's talents is the best way to promote one's own survival and a willingness to do what one can to develop one's own talents. Moody-Adams's point is that oppressed people are rewarded for not developing their talents. Shreya fighting small battles against everyday sexism or racism can, under ongoing sexist and racist circumstances, become a way of not investing in her own talents. Instead of getting herself into a position where she can do challenging legal work, her "disagreeableness" may condemn her to being stuck in a professional position lesser than the one she believes she deserves. Though Chloe's example is less clearly about talents, she, too, may stop fighting because she perceives her goals as just as worthy as those of her partner. She may, to take an example from Hill, find that her goal of writing a book criticizing the institution of marriage (Hill 1973: 96) is impeded by having to fight him day in and day out.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Neither of these cases (as described in the last paragraph) is a case of paradigmatic adaptive preference (Khader 2013), because neither Chloe nor Shreya buys into the goals of the order that subordinates them. Both believe something is wrong with the constraints oppression has placed on their opportunities. Choosing the second-best option and recognizing it as the best thing one can do to execute a life plan one sees as just as inherently valuable as anyone else's is different from believing that one deserves less than members of the dominant group. Note also that Chloe and Shreya are self-respecting in two senses; they believe their individual plans are worth pursuing and believe something is wrong with the oppression of other members of their groups. Chloe and Shreya cannot express the view that they have equal value to members of dominant groups without acting in ways that undermine their ability to pursue life plans that are both their own and oppression-rejecting. So, self-respect as treating one's projects as possessed of equal value is at odds with self-respect as demanding equal recognition from others in any given moment.

### **2. Resistance without Noncompliance?**

In a social world structured in the way I have described, the oppressed agent's belief that she possesses equal worth does not on its own tell her whether to comply with norms that subjugate her. Oppressive structures cause her concerns about taking a stand to cut in the opposite direction of concerns about treating her life plan as worth pursuing. This may trigger the worry that I am saying that self-respect should not figure at all in oppressed agents' decisions about what to do. A first line of response to this worry is just that a calculation about how to best express self-respect is manifest in the oppressed agent's choice about which of two unacceptable options to choose. If Chloe decides that it is more consistent with self-respect for her to focus her energies on writing a book about the ills of marriage than to fight her husband at every turn, value for self-respect has indeed figured in her action. If this reply is unsatisfactory because it seems that an agent must always be able to fully communicate and express self-respect in her action, I can only reply that the worry is based on a desire for the world to be other than it is; that oppressed agents will have difficulty fully expressing self-respect in action is a problem with the world, not my theoretical position.

A more robust response to the worry that I leave no room for self-respect in the lives of the oppressed requires us to shift from the question of whether compliance can be self-respecting to more general questions about what agents need to maintain self-respect under conditions of oppression over a lifetime. Self-respecting oppressed agents, like all self-respecting agents, must see themselves as equal to others and live in a way consistent with these beliefs. I have discussed how oppression threatens agents' abilities to express self-respect, but another feature of oppressive social contexts is also relevant here: being oppressed involves being surrounded by representations of one's group as lesser and receiving material and social rewards for confirming widely held beliefs that members of one's group are lesser, and it involves the obscuring of social structures to this end. The views about oppressed people's worth "lying around" in dominant social reality do not help them make the case that they are equal, even to themselves. In other words, oppression does not merely threaten to impact self-respect at the level of expression; it persistently threatens the development and maintenance of self-respecting attitudes.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Views that deny the equality of oppressed people do not all take the form of claims about the fundamental moral entitlements of members of oppressed groups. It is not only views that explicitly deem women, people of color, or others inferior that get in the way of their understanding themselves as equal. Ideology also operates by encouraging oppressed people to conclude that they fail to succeed at the same rate as others because they are defective. Dominant ideology obscures the external barriers that limit oppressed people's life opportunities, often leaving them to conclude, when their achievements are frustrated, that the fault is theirs. As Sandra Bartky (1990) argues, the oppressed individual may explain her difficulties in one of two ways. She may either conclude that she individually lacks competence or merit, or that all members of her group do. So Shreya may think, when she is asked to make the coffee, either that she is being asked because she personally is a worse lawyer, or that the legal labor of women or people of color is generally less valuable than that of men or whites. Either type of belief undermines recognition self-respect.

Oppressed individuals thus need more than a general belief in the moral equality of human beings to maintain recognition self-respect. They need access to a social analysis that makes the oppressive structure visible. In her work on moral failure, Lisa Tessman argues that oppressed individuals have a special need to be able to raise normative questions about background contexts, and not merely about their own behavior (Tessman 2015: 177–190). Accepting an analysis similar to the analysis of double binds above, Tessman argues that oppressed individuals will often confront situations in which none of the available options is morally adequate (Tessman 2015: 177). If they cannot see that there is something tragic about the situation that they find themselves in, they may transform what Tessman thinks is appropriately held guilt into blame. The upshot of Tessman's analysis is clearer for evaluative self-respect than it is for recognition self-respect. In order not to judge themselves morally reprehensible for, say, acts of instrumental oppressive norm compliance, oppressed people need to be able to morally evaluate the social conditions that demand it. However, we can make an analogous point about recognition self-respect. Neither compliance nor noncompliance offers an *adequate* way of expressing self-respect because agents deserve the ability to both treat their life plans as worth pursuing and to be seen by all members of their society as equal. In order to avoid seeing their own lack of worth as the cause of their inability to treat themselves as equal and communicate their equality to the dominant, oppressed people need to keep in view knowledge of the structural impediments facing them and a sense that these impediments are unjust and contingent.

I call this view of oneself as possessed of equal worth, and one's society as tragically failing to recognize it, a "counterhegemonic normative perspective." I think the work of self-respect that oppressed people are obligated to engage in lies in the cultivation of such a perspective—not in acts of compliance or noncompliance with oppressive norms. It is true that this perspective does not readily tell them what to do in cases where they are asked to comply with oppressive norms; it only tells them that they should not face such a choice. This may trigger a refined version of the worry that I have left little room for self-respect in the lives of the oppressed: namely, that my conception of the self-regarding duties of the oppressed places self-respect "in the head." I disagree. As Robin Dillon argues, "paying attention to oneself " in self-valuing ways is itself work, and work that members of oppressed groups are discouraged from doing (Dillon 1995: 302). Cultivating a counterhegemonic normative perspective in a world that discourages it requires acts and is itself a form of acting, for attempting to maintain an attitude while never having it confirmed or being motivated by it will be ineffective for most people. To bring into view the acts that constitute and help members of oppressed groups cultivate counterhegemonic perspectives, it will be helpful to have in mind a social fact I call "the variegation of the public." To say that the public is variegated means, at a basic level, that different social groups interpret social reality differently and develop means for communicating these differing interpretations. As Iris Marion Young argues, sharing experiences of subordination allows oppressed groups to develop internal interpretive perspectives (Young 1990). The idea of multiple publics is discussed frequently in antioppression theorizing, especially in women of color feminisms,5 but my discussion here will borrow most heavily from Maria Lugones's work on what she calls "ontological pluralism."6

The variegation of the public means that oppressed people inhabit what Lugones calls other "worlds" alongside the world of the dominant. Some of the most ready-to-hand examples of alternative publics are organized political movements, some of which openly challenge the status quo, and I will return below to the role of counterhegemonic understandings in movement-building. But Lugones emphasizes how more mundane interactions cultivate alternative publics. These acts of creating shared understanding through association are of two broad types. One involves members of an oppressed group interacting in the absence of members of the dominant group. According to Lugones, such actions are simply missed by those who theorize the lives of oppressed individuals only insofar as they are victims of oppression. She illustrates the philosophical lacuna in a criticism of Aristotle. "We know the slave only through the master. . .After working hours, he or she is folded and placed into a drawer until the next morning" (Lugones 1987: 18). But oppressed people interact with one another at the metaphorical and literal end of the day. Chloe may pick up the phone to mock her partner's neediness, and Shreya may complain about being asked to make coffee at a happy hour with other friends who are not white. In cases like these, oppressed agents can affirm their equality—and do it intersubjectively. Though cases where people are expected to comply with oppressive norms are not completely coextensive with cases where members of dominant groups are present (because of intersecting oppressions and because oppressive norms do not always know spatial boundaries), it remains true that oppressed agents will face opportunities to act in their lives that are not primarily demands to comply with oppressive norms.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

A second type of act that builds counterhegemonic self-understandings is, at least prima facie, an act of oppressive norm compliance. Members of oppressed groups also often interact with one another while they are complying with oppressive norms, and the multiplicity of audiences allows such acts to have more than one simultaneous meaning. As Lugones puts it, members of oppressed groups cultivate a type of "double vision" and act in ways that communicate different meanings to members of different groups (Lugones 1987; 2003: 53–64, 151–167). They can communicate acceptance of oppression to some and nonacceptance to others in a single act. Consider the act of exchanging a knowing glance with someone when a third person who is an object of mutual criticism is in the room. The act, if successful, communicates criticism that is undetectable, or only marginally detectable, to its object. Such hidden meanings are not merely shareable by friends; they are shareable by those with whom one shares social group membership. Shreya may subtly roll her eyes when she is asked to make the coffee and another person of color may notice. Or, Shreya may apologize for "forgetting" to go to the store before birthday parties, and the special perceptual attunements of other members of oppressed groups may allow them to see that Shreya has not really forgotten anything at all. Such acts allow oppressed individuals to signal, in the very moment, that their oppressive norm compliance is not acceptance of the status the dominant accord them. Note that the double binds I discussed in section 1 above mean that the success of such strategies in not undermining their authors' welfare depends on their being undetectable to some.

These acts may still seem to fall short, perhaps because it seems self-respecting acts must *communicate*. Since these acts do communicate with the oppressed, these acts can only fall short if there is something special about communication with the dominant. Boxill's argument that oppressed agents need external confirmation that they actually believe in their own equality is met by the two types of acts I just mentioned (Boxill 1976). Hill offers a more demanding version of the same view, one that explicitly demands the communication of one's equality to members of dominant groups. According to Hill, the person who does not stand up for herself7 suggests that she does not want "the provisions of morality to be publicly honored and acknowledged" (Hill 1995: 100).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

It may seem that noncompliance is the way to communicate to the dominant that those norms are unjust and ought to be dismantled. A first problem with this idea is that oppressed people cannot generally expect acts of noncompliance to successfully communicate self-respect to the dominant. Chloe's story is a case in point; try as she may to assert that she has a right to refuse sex, Chloe's partner continues to believe that she is frigid or does not love him. More importantly, however, participation in worlds of the dominated can demonstrate a desire to have one's equality recognized. Though we should be cautious about romanticizing them,8 groups of oppressed people offer opportunities for oppressed individuals to have their equal status recognized. Additionally, such communities often sow the seeds for organized political action that aims at undermining the oppressive social order. So, investing in communities that protect one is a way of contributing to a world where one is treated as though one matters, and such communities often need to be thriving in order to engage in organized action that changes the oppressive structure.

There is another reason that cultivating counterhegemonic perspectives does not amount to nonaction on the part of the oppressed. This is that, when one is oppressed, viewing oneself as equal and the system as unjust performatively constitutes a resistant act.9 As Fanon famously argued, oppression aims, not merely at reducing the material options of the oppressed, but at psychically dominating (or in his words, "alienating"). It aims at getting the oppressed to internalize the gaze of the oppressor, to measure themselves as inadequate relative to the members of the dominant group who are truly "human" (Fanon 2008). If oppressive orders aim at psychic alienation, refusing to see oneself as the order dictates just is resisting that order.10

### **3. Self-Regarding Duties to Resist and Desiderata for Anti-Oppression Theory**

My analysis above suggests that, under the social conditions characteristic of oppression, self-respect concerns are not decisive about whether agents should or should not comply with oppressive norms. Arguments that dictate a self-regarding duty not to comply, then, are based on a misunderstanding of the empirical realities oppressed agents face and may in fact offer dangerous prescriptions. Theories that misdescribe the obligations of the oppressed risk presenting self-harming behavior as morally praiseworthy when it is not, perpetuating ideologies that hold the oppressed individuals more responsible for their condition than they are, and prescribing behavior that impedes anti-oppressive social change. An advantage of my account of the self-regarding duties of the oppressed is that it avoids these risks, where competing accounts that prescribe duties not to comply run directly into them. I will argue in this section that arguments for a self-regarding duty not to comply from Carol Hay (2011) and Daniel Silvermint (2013) fall foul of key desiderata for anti-oppression theorizing, and do so largely because of misunderstandings of the empirical facts about oppressive social conditions.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

To clarify what is at stake in theorizing about the obligations of oppressed people, we can note a phenomenon Margaret Urban Walker calls "epistemic rigging." Walker argues that "the discourse of moral philosophy . . .is not outside the social discourse of morality" (Walker 2007: 4). Because moral philosophy is continuous with social practices of assigning responsibility, philosophers may, intentionally or unintentionally, contribute to social practices that keep oppressed people in their place (Walker 2007: 133). One way to minimize this risk is to assess theories, not only in terms of their logical consistency, but also in terms of how they contribute to anti-oppressive social aims. This is a point Charles Mills and Elizabeth Anderson have developed in their defense of "nonideal" theory and that Sally Haslanger has developed in her discussion of the "ameliorative" role of concepts. If philosophical prescriptions about oppression are likely to get in the way of social change that would end oppression, we should take this as a strike against those prescriptions. There are at least two ways self-respect-related prescriptions to the oppressed risk falling foul of anti-oppressive desiderata: they risk blaming victims and encouraging victims to engage in behavior that is unlikely to contribute to ending—and may even worsen—their own oppression. Avoiding such outcomes is an important desideratum for anti-oppressive theorizing.

To see how arguments that self-respecting oppressed people should refuse to comply with oppressive norms can succumb to these risks, we must look at these arguments in more detail. Hay (2011) and Silvermint (2013) advance distinct arguments for a self-regarding duty not to comply with oppressive norms. Hay's stated argument is that complying with oppressive norms damages an agent's rational nature and is thus self-disrespecting in a Kantian sense. What Hay actually argues is that oppressive norm compliance reduces a person's ability to act rationally and ought to be avoided because of this. Though Hay does adopt the Kantian idea that one has a duty to protect one's rational nature, Hay does not adopt the Kantian claim that servile acts *express* self-disregard and that there is thus a perfect duty to avoid them. Her view instead seems to be that (some) oppression-compliant acts diachronically reduce a person's ability to act rationally, and this reading of her will inform my criticism below.11

Silvermint argues that compliance with oppressive norms is not self-respecting because it involves adopting the ends of an unjust social order that does not appreciate one's worth as a person. This is a problem, in Silvermint's eyes, not because self-respect has some worth independent of well-being, but rather because adopting the ends of an unjust order means adopting ends that are not genuinely one's own, and this in turn gets in the way of her life going well. Silvermint's tight connection between self-value and autonomy is made possible by a normatively laden conception of autonomy according to which we only count as directing our own lives if we live lives that adopt morally worthy ends. Ends that devalue certain persons in oppressive ways are one subset of morally unworthy ends whose pursuit is likely to reduce the well-being of those who adopt them.12 Silvermint's view thus seems to be that a person who adopts the aims of a social order that treats her unjustly is self-disrespecting because she adopts morally unworthy ends that will reduce her well-being.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Moving from claims about the nature and role of self-respect to the general idea that oppressive norm compliance is self-disrespecting, as Hay and Silvermint do, requires empirical assumptions—and ones I take to be false. Both claim that what makes action self-disrespecting is the diachronic effects of the action on the agent. Like most claims about cause and effect in social philosophy, the claim that oppression-compliant acts are disrespectful in this way inevitably rests on empirical claims. Hay argues that oppressed agents harm themselves by internalizing oppressive norms and becoming akratic or irrational, and Silvermint argues that advancing the aims of the oppressive order means adopting ends inconsistent with one's own value, and that this gets in the way of one's ability to pursue one's well-being. Once we see the importance of empirical assumptions to Hay's and Silvermint's analyses, we can raise the question of whether they are based on accurate understandings of what is at stake in decisions whether to comply with oppressive norms. My account of how oppression structures oppressed agents' options in the first two sections of this essay suggests that they are not. Hay's analysis relies heavily on the idea that oppression causes oppressive norm internalization, which in turn causes akrasia, lack of means-end rationality, and so on. The presence of the variegated publics and the double binds I described earlier give us reason to doubt the strength and frequency of internalization; what looks like internalization may just be instrumental oppressive norm compliance, and the double vision offered by alternative publics can exert a protective force against internalization. Moreover, Hay's exclusive focus on harms to one's rationality that can come about through internalization and harms to means-end rationality suggests a sense that oppression is mostly exposure to bad beliefs about oneself, or a lack of opportunity to develop one's reasoning capacities, rather than a set of pervasive material rewards and penalties that limit what oppressed agents can and cannot pursue. The idea that Hay represents oppression as reducible to exposure to beliefs that devalue the self or lack of opportunities to develop capacities to reason is also supported by her presentation of akrasia and assaults on means-end rationality as central cases of oppression. After all, she concludes from some examples of low self-worth, lack of means-end rationality, and akrasia that there is a general duty to resist oppression.

Silvermint's assertion that an oppressed agent's life goes worse if she complies with oppressive norms seems straightforwardly to deny the pervasiveness of penalties for noncompliance. Silvermint allows that instrumental oppressive norm compliance is possible, but he argues that complying over a lifetime is blameworthy because it is harmful (Silvermint 2013: 419). But it is unclear why it would be harmful unless cases where one's ability to execute one's life plan required oppressive norm compliance were rare—or to put the point conversely, opportunities to advance one's aims without oppressive norm compliance were abundant. To return to Shreya and Chloe, the idea that their lifelong compliance undermines their projects in a blameworthy way is only plausible if Shreya faces career consequences for not meeting sexist and racist expectations only rarely, and if Chloe can successfully convince her partner or someone else to treat sex as something she has a right to withhold. And even then, real-world agents like Chloe have lives beyond their professional and romantic ones; for it to be generally true that compliance worsened their abilities to pursue well-being, other structural double binds would have to be rare or episodic as well.

I point out these (in my view) specious empirical assumptions, because I think they result in theories that are complicit in victim-blaming and prescriptions that are unlikely to help oppressed people overcome their plight. Hay's and Silvermint's arguments for a duty not to comply fall short of desiderata for avoiding victimblaming in two ways. First, they are complicit in upholding widespread but false views about why the oppressed are in the situation they are in—views that occlude the structural causes of oppression and blithely attribute defects to the oppressed. I have already explained that both Hay and Silvermint downplay the presence of structural constraints and emphasize the influence of oppressed agents' own behavior on their suffering. Hay's discussion of akrasia is particularly illustrative of how claims about a self-regarding duty not to comply can reinforce dominant victim-blaming narratives. Hay states that oppressed people, by complying with oppressive norms, come to "hold themselves to low moral standards," wherein they cannot do what they see themselves as having reason to do.13 Hay's chosen example of akrasia is that women consent to unwanted sex "because they cannot see how to say no" (Hay 2011: 27). In a society characterized by rape culture, responsibility for unwanted sex is already presumptively placed on victims; Hay's emphasis on the moral failings of women does little to challenge the presumption.

Though the example is particularly egregious, a broader and more important point about victim-blaming is that Hay's reasoning about the example, typical of reasoning behind claims about a duty not to comply, magnifies an existing tendency to attribute the causes of oppressed agents' condition to themselves, and to their moral defects, rather than structures. According to Hay, some women "recognize that they have reason to refrain from having sex but acquiesce in their partners' sexual desires nevertheless...And engaging in such irrational behavior is evidence their rational nature has been harmed in some way" (Hay 2011: 27). It is far from clear that acquiescing in sex one sees a reason not to have is evidence that an agent is irrational; to push this conclusion is to ignore the multiplicity of reasons that may weigh upon an agent in such situations, including double binds that make accepting unwanted sexual contact a condition for achieving other aims in life. Narratives like Chloe's, and the many other similar ones in Nicola Gavey's work, suggest that low moral standards and lack of rationality tell very little of the story about women's engagement in unwanted sex. Silvermint's arguments imply that agents who comply routinely with oppressive norms exhibit insufficient moral goodness. In fact, on Silvermint's account, oppressed agents who comply with oppressive norms routinely are doubly morally wrong; they fail to advance their own well-being, and they do so through the taking of the morally noxious ends of oppression as their own.

An advantage of my view that emphasizes structural double binds and variegated publics is that it resists promiscuously locating moral defects in oppressed agents. Acknowledging alternative publics and the frequent need for instrumental oppressive norm compliance makes clear that compliance often happens concurrently with, and is publicly intelligible as compatible with, high moral standards. Compliant agents may be acting in the most self-valuing way possible under nonideal conditions and often have intact views of their own worth, despite their failure (or success, depending on how one looks at it) at communicating their worth to the dominant. Conservatism about construing a person's own agency as a part of the apparatus of self-harm is desirable for anti-oppressive philosophy in a world that already assumes that internal defects are the main reason for oppressed people's failure to flourish.

A second way the alternative views participate in victim-blaming is by creating the sense that the problems to which they respond are actually widespread. Cheshire Calhoun argues that theories can have nonlogical implications; they may suppose acceptance of certain beliefs about the world that are not required by any particular theory and may add credibility to those beliefs (Calhoun 1988: 452–453). Prescribing a duty to do something risks suggesting that not enough people are doing it, and we should avoid theories that paint the oppressed as failing to resist when they actually are. Hay's argument that the oppressed have a duty to protect their rational capacities is particularly problematic in this regard. We have little reason to believe that any of the three ways she describes oppressive norm compliance as reducing rationality are typical of oppression—and even she seems to claim only that reduced rationality is *possible* about the cases she describes. One, lack of means-end rationality caused by lack of education or malnutrition, is related to oppression quite contingently (and it is not clear how one would resist it anyway in the cases she mentions, as where one is raised in a country where there is little food or very limited access to education for girls), and the others are potentially exceptional responses to oppression. Lack of self-worth caused by internalization of oppressive norms seems to be the most likely of the phenomena Hay describes to be common, but there is a substantial body of literature engaged with the realities of women's lives asking us to question the frequency of this phenomenon (Meyers 2002; Narayan 2002; Jaggar 2006; Khader 2011; Sperry 2013).14 Suggesting that oppressed people need to do more to preserve their rationality is worrisome when it is unclear that their rationality is commonly compromised and in a world in which oppressed people's desires are already often disregarded for morally arbitrary reasons.

Rather than suggesting that oppressed people currently engage in insufficient resistance, my account of the impacts of oppression on self-respect draws attention to the epistemic difficulties involved in claims that oppressed people are lacking in rationality, or are otherwise inadequately resisting. If oppressed people often risk both well-being and self-respect in acts of noncompliance, we should be hesitant about claiming that their compliance with oppressive norms evidences deficits of character or rationality. The protective resources offered by alternative publics, coupled with incentives for oppressed people to make their resistant acts unintelligible, or only marginally intelligible, to the dominant compounds the existing reason for caution. Though my account does not hold that oppressed people never betray themselves by complying with oppressive norms, it highlights constraints on action by the oppressed that are useful in making more accurate judgments about why oppressed people are complicit in their own oppression.

Victim-blaming gets in the way of anti-oppressive aims, but so does prescribing forms of action that are likely to cause harm to victims while doing little to dismantle oppressive systems. Anti-oppressive theorizing should also attempt to make prescriptions that are consistent with the political aims of mitigating and ending oppression, and it is unclear that prescriptions not to comply meet this desideratum. My account makes clear that asking the oppressed not to comply with oppressive norms often asks them to incur costs to well-being and selfrespect. It is thus sensitive to the fact that prescribing noncompliance often means prescribing self-sacrifice and worsening lives. It may of course be objected, as Kantians often do in discussions of self-respect, that morality is just hard. However, if my descriptive account is correct, a moral theory that takes noncompliance to be obligatory in a large number of cases asks oppressed people to sacrifice their welfare and self-respect *routinely* (see also Khader 2020). Moreover, it asks them to engage in forms of self-sacrifice not required of the dominant. It is potentially inconsistent with the aims of anti-oppressive theorizing to accept prescriptions that disproportionately burden the oppressed.15 Anti-oppressive theorists have a right to consider the burdens a moral theory assigns to the oppressed as a strike in favor of or against that theory. To assume that it is acceptable for a moral theory to be extremely demanding on the oppressed is question-begging and to stack the feminist philosophical deck in favor of Kantianism.

Moral theories can also impede anti-oppression politics by recommending a focus on individual behavioral change to the exclusion of movements. One worry

about Hay's and Silvermint's duties not to comply is that they focus on resistance by individual oppressed agents. The focus on standing up for oneself and demanding change for one's group are not mutually exclusive, but they are also not as mutually supporting as they may initially appear to be. Simple everyday actions are so fraught with well-being costs for the oppressed that objecting to individual oppressive acts can interfere with executing *any* life plan—including a life plan devoted to opposing oppressive systems. Shreya may do more to oppose oppression by gaining enough status in law to start her own anti-discrimination firm than by refusing to make the coffee, and Chloe may do more by becoming an activist against sexual assault than by constantly arguing with her partner. There is a danger that theories focused on standing up for oneself in individual cases will promote episodic individual grandstanding over the type of collective action that is likely to undermine oppression. Additionally, the focus on individual acts of noncompliance can encourage forms of action that focus on communication with members of the dominant group to the exclusion of the cultivation of collective consciousness among the oppressed. But since collective action is especially likely to be effective in stopping oppressive norms from obtaining, asking oppressed individuals to focus on the dominant is at least sometimes to discourage investment in the collective consciousness that would make change.

Variegated publics and the covert forms of resistance they enable preserve spaces for the oppressed to communicate with one another and can be important catalysts for movements that change social structures. As is often argued in feminist discussions of consciousness-raising, part of the value of recognizing unjust structural constraints with an affinity group is that it helps one come to want to dismantle them. It is not only official political groups and organized activities that create consciousness capable of making change; actions as simple as shared glances can contribute to political solidarity. Shreya may know from observing how her colleagues react to sexist and racist demands on her who she can count on when she decides to implement anti-discrimination policies after her promotion. Indeed, many of the actions we think of as individual acts of noncompliance that mattered to political structures, such as Rosa Parks's refusal to sit in the back of the bus or Simone de Beauvoir and Catherine Deneuve's signings of the Manifesto of the 343, were actually the result of coordinated action among oppressed people first. My point here is less to deny that individual noncompliance can have value than to say that hanging the self-regarding duties of the oppressed heavily on it may point them away from the forms of solidarity-building *among the oppressed* that would contribute to ending their oppression.

A potential objection to my worries about getting in the way of social movements is that the purpose of self-respect is not to offer a recipe for change in the world, but rather simply to encourage integrity in the agent. The force of this objection will of course depend on one's underlying moral theory. I think all we need to see for the purpose of criticizing a duty of noncompliance is that, where structural double binds are present, noncompliance with oppressive norms also threatens the integrity of oppressed agents. Shreya does not just give up on what she cares about by not protesting the demand to make the coffee; she also gives up on what she cares about by protesting, since she knows she is not doing the best thing she can do to succeed at becoming a lawyer. Absent some special reason that the agent's rationality, autonomy, or integrity is increased by the noncompliance side of the double bind more than the compliance side, it seems legitimate to count compatibility with feminist politics in the host of reasons to accept or reject a view of the obligations of the oppressed.

I have criticized Hay's and Silvermint's arguments in hopes of showing that a self-regarding duty to cultivate a counterhegemonic normative perspective is more consistent with the aims of anti-oppressive theorizing than a duty not to comply with oppressive norms. It may be objected, however, that I am misattributing to Hay and Silvermint the view that the duty of self-respect under conditions of oppression is a duty not to comply. After all, Hay and Silvermint use the term "resistance" rather than noncompliance, and both take pains to claim they do not wish to limit resistance to a particular form. However, besides a couple of offhand examples,16 both focus on acts of noncompliance as instances of resistance. Silvermint discusses acts not aimed at the dominant group mostly pejoratively, as instances of failed or incomplete resistance. He draws a sharp contrast between "passively believing one has value" (Silvermint 2013: 421) and resistance. Though she does once suggest that non-internalization of oppressive norms can be resistance, Hay (2011) does not describe instances of resistance not aimed at members of the dominant group at all.

More importantly, though, Hay and Silvermint seem logically committed to an emphasis on noncompliance since compliance is, for both of them, a key mechanism through which oppressed agents cause harm to themselves, to their rational capacities and their well-being respectively. The relevant duties for them are duties to avoid the harmful results of compliance; since they see the results of compliance to affect agents largely through their own individual action, individual noncompliance is the logical solution.

Perhaps there is another way to defend Hay and Silvermint from my allegation that they fall foul of the desiderata of anti-oppression theorizing. I have argued that their prescriptions are too demanding and that they perpetuate views that victims of oppression cause their own oppression. But because Hay (differing from Kant) and Silvermint prescribe *imperfect* duties to resist, I may be wrong to suggest they recommend general noncompliance. But pairing even an imperfect duty with my descriptive analysis has perverse results for anti-oppressive theorizing. To say that noncompliance is not required in every case is still to make a virtue of it, and if my descriptive analysis is correct, making a virtue of noncompliance is more or less tantamount to making a virtue of self-sacrifice. Further, rather than solving the problem of demandingness, bringing contextual considerations into view, as talk of imperfect duties does, seems (when paired with accurate empirical assumptions) to either vanish the duty not to comply or fetishize noncompliance.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

When paired with the descriptive assumptions on which I relied in the first two sections, neither Hay's nor Silvermint's argument successfully establishes that noncompliance is *ever* required in the life of any individual agent. We can grant that oppressed agents should act in ways that value their own rationality (in the case of Hay) or justice or well-being (in the case of Silvermint). But if I am right about how oppressive social worlds are structured, respecting these elements of oneself may be accomplished within individual lives without a single act of noncompliance. It then becomes unclear what is gained by prescribing a duty not to comply. In fact, it seems that an imperfect duty not to comply *overspecifies* the self-regarding duties of the oppressed, and does so in ways that have the potential to be victim-blaming and social movement undermining in a world that already occludes oppressive structures. Hay and Silvermint, if they were to attempt to revise their prescriptions and examples in light of what I take to be the empirical facts, would have to allow that cases where noncompliance is required are in fact rare. My view that the oppressed have a duty to seek a counterhegemonic normative perspective offers an account that shifts blame off the oppressed and directs them toward forms of change that are likely to change structures; and it does so without denying that noncompliant behavior *can* be self-respecting.

### **Conclusion: Self-Regarding Duties under Conditions of Oppression**

Much is at stake in attempts to prescribe moral obligations to the oppressed. At the same time as we want to valorize acts of defiance, we need to recognize the structural character of oppression and avoid uncritically centering the gaze of the dominant. Oppressed people typically do have to comply with oppressive norms to advance their goals, but it does not follow from this that they come to see themselves as value-less or take the ends of the oppressive order as their own. Instead, they engage in the work of self-respect by enacting and developing counterhegemonic normative standards with members of oppressed groups. Recognizing these facts can serve as the basis for better moral theory and an optimistic anti-oppressive politics. Theories that posit a choice between devaluing oneself and publicly taking a stand seem suited to lives where forced choices between getting by and asserting one's worth are rare or episodic, rather than nonideal lives where such double binds are ubiquitous. Recognizing that dominated people's everyday lives are sites of self-valuing and opposition to oppression allows us to avoid promiscuous negative moral judgments about them, and offers moral prescriptions consistent with the aim of bringing about a more just world.17

### **Notes**

- 1. Shreya is an imagined example reconstructed on the basis of data about challenges to women's advancement in the workplace. Chloe is one of Nicola Gavey's subjects.
- 2. Rosa Terlazzo (2016) argues that oppressed people have an imperfect other-regarding duty to resist. The other-regarding duty she prescribes can be discharged either through acts of noncompliance or through the types of acts I describe in the second section of the essay.
- 3. For an argument that it is difficult to read endorsement of oppression from the behavior of oppressed agents see Khader (2011).
- 4. To point this out is to suggest neither that resistance is futile nor that oppression is harmless. The key is that *collective* action is typically necessary to combat oppression. It is also fully plausible to claim that Shreya stands to benefit from complying with oppressive norms without claiming that sexist oppression does not harm her. The relative poverty of her option set is itself an injustice.
- 5. Discussions of variegated publics are common in philosophy by people of color, especially feminists of color, including the work of Patricia Hill-Collins, W. E. B. Dubois, Gloria Anzaldua, and Audre Lorde.
- 6. Lugones argues that world-traveling implies multiplicity of selves, but my analysis is agnostic on this.
- 7. Hill allows that "special explanations" might relax the duty to publicly stand up for oneself, but, as we shall see, I believe oppressed people often, or typically, have moral and prudential reasons not to engage in public protest.
- 8. Lugones warns against idealizing these communities in ways that ignore the difficulties they pose for people facing multiple oppressions.
- 9. I am grateful to Matt Lindauer for this point.
- 10. The view that refusing psychic domination just is resistant should not be confused with the claim that refusing psychic domination improves the individual's well-being.
- 11. Hay argues that oppression *causes* other phenomena that are rationality undermining. For example, she states that oppressive norm compliance can cause akrasia, and that akrasia is self-disrespecting—not that oppressive norm compliance is itself selfdisrespecting.
- 12. Silvermint's definition of autonomy is substantive, though he suggests otherwise (Silvermint 2013: 49). He holds that a person cannot live an autonomous life if they endorse the ends of an oppressive order. I think this view confuses self-direction with valuing justice, both because I believe it is possible to genuinely endorse one's oppression (Khader 2011; 2013) and because I believe it is often individually self-interested to comply with oppressive norms.
- 13. I understand Hay's akrasia claim in this way, because she treats the internalization of oppressive norms as distinct from akrasia. Her akrasia cases involve agents thinking something is worth doing and then doing another thing rather than the belief that oppressive norm compliance is inherently worthwhile.
- 14. I have argued at length against the view that oppressed people lack means-end rationality and claimed that oppressed people often exercise high-level deliberative powers

in handling the tradeoffs associated with oppression and deprivation (Khader 2011: 41–74; 2013).

- 15. Silvermint expresses a version of this worry when he argues, against Ann Cudd, that oppressed people should be allowed to prioritize their well-being over the well-being of others, given how constrained their lives already are (Silvermint 2013: 414).
**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

- 16. Silvermint mentions cases where attempts at resistance are not witnessed by members of the dominant group but leaves open the question of whether they are resistant in some cases (2013: 407–408) or aligns them with passivity in others (2013: 418).
