Of Mice and Carrots

*Lucia Schwarz*

### **Introduction**

In environmental ethics, biocentrism holds that all living things matter morally or have inherent worth; it is traditionally juxtaposed with anthropocentrism, which holds that humans alone have moral standing (Nolt 2015: 163; Taylor 1981: 198).1 *Species egalitarian* biocentrists believe that all living things possess *the same* inherent worth. Paul Taylor has famously argued that species egalitarianism is part of a belief system that underlies and justifies respect for nature. Others deny this alleged link between species egalitarianism and respect for nature. However, recent debates on the topic can give one the impression that, in practice, it does not make much of a difference whether one is a species egalitarian or inegalitarian. For species egalitarians and what we might call "enlightened inegalitarians" (who oppose the ruthless exploitation and instrumentalization of nature by humans), paying proper respect to nature will result in more or less the same treatment of animals, plants, and other living things. In particular, species egalitarians have argued that, initial appearances notwithstanding, their view does not have any particularly radical implications when compared to more mainstream views. In this essay, I question whether species egalitarians haven't been overly concessive and prematurely abandoned a line of moral reasoning that deserves more attention.

In section 1, I outline a controversy that has haunted species egalitarianism since its inception. According to critics, species egalitarianism counterintuitively implies that it is no worse to kill a human than to kill an insect, no worse to kill a sentient animal than to kill a plant. In defending themselves against this charge, species egalitarians have portrayed their view as more moderate than its fundamental principles might suggest. However, in doing so, I suggest, they have given up much of what seemed to make their view distinctive. In section 2, I provide reasons for pursuing a more radical species egalitarianism. I focus on three questions: whether it is worse to kill sentient animals than to kill plants, whether it is

worse to kill more cognitively sophisticated animals than to kill less sophisticated ones, and whether it is permissible for humans to kill other living beings in order to eat them.

Let me clarify at the outset that this is not a political essay; it should not be read as making practical recommendations for how, as a society, we should interact with the non-human world. Rather, this essay is speculative in nature. I pry, raise questions, and *explore* certain answers to these questions, but, as I state in the conclusion, I am ultimately not sure what the correct answers are. My (perhaps mischievous) intention is to make the reader a little less sure, too.

### **1. Species Egalitarianism under Attack**

Among the pioneers of biocentrism, Paul Taylor has most clearly formulated the doctrine of species egalitarianism. He holds that each organism is "a teleological center of life, pursuing its own good in its own way" (Taylor 1981: 207). Something is a teleological center of a life when "its internal functioning as well as its external activities are all goal-oriented, having the constant tendency to maintain the organism's existence through time and to enable it successfully to perform those biological operations whereby it reproduces its kind and continually adapts to changing environmental events and conditions" (Taylor 2011: 121–122).2 Notably, plants and other non-sentient, non-conscious organisms count as teleological centers of life as well. Taylor holds that humans are neither superior to other species nor do they have more inherent worth in virtue of, say, their capacity for rational thought. Because rational thought or any other human-specific capacity has value only from the perspective of a distinctly human life. Other species do not need these capacities—but need *other* capacities—in order to achieve *their* species-specific goods (Taylor 1981: 212, 215). To reject human superiority, says Taylor, "entails its positive counterpart: the doctrine of species impartiality," which holds that all living things possess the same inherent worth (Taylor 1981: 217). Things that have inherent worth, in turn, are the appropriate objects of respect. Thus, Taylor concludes, the key to adopting an attitude of respect for nature is the denial of human superiority (Taylor 1981: 217).

Note that the kind of respect Taylor means is "recognition respect," rather than "appraisal respect" (Taylor 2011: 60 n.1). Appraisal respect is what we have in virtue of a thing's merits or excellences, whereas recognition respect is what we have when we view something as worthy of moral consideration (Darwall 1977).

A focal point for critics of species egalitarianism has been its apparently absurd implications for the comparative badness of harming members of different species and for the adjudication of inter-species conflicts. On Taylor's view, it seems that shooting one's neighbor is "no more morally reprehensible than swatting a fly or stepping on a wild flower" (Spitler 1982: 260). According to some commentators, most prominently David Schmidtz, not only are the implications of species egalitarianism counterintuitive, but to act in line with them would actually amount to a *failure* to respect nature:

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Most vegetarians think it is worse to kill a cow than to kill a carrot. Are they wrong? Yes, they are, according to species egalitarianism. Therein lies egalitarianism's failure to respect nature . . .if we treat a chimpanzee no better than we would treat a carrot, that is a failure of respect, not a token of it. Failing to respect what makes living things different is not a way of respecting them. It is, instead, a way of being indiscriminate. (Schmidtz 2011: 129)3

Note that one need not be an anthropocentrist in order to raise this criticism against species egalitarianism. Biocentrists generally agree that all living things have moral standing, but some assume that members of certain species nevertheless have greater moral standing than others (Lombardi 1983: 262–263; Varner 2002).

Species egalitarians, as well as scholars arguing on their behalf, have denied that their view has such unpalatable implications. James Sterba argues that ethical vegetarianism makes sense for species egalitarians "as a way to preventing suffering to animals, a problem that does not present itself when we dine on vegetables" (Sterba 2011: 169).4 While all living things have the same inherent worth, if hurting one of them causes suffering and hurting the other one doesn't, then we have an independent reason to hurt the former, rather than the latter. Killing plants in order to eat them, in turn, is justified by a principle of human self-preservation on Sterba's account (Sterba 2011: 167). He adds, though, that aggression against the basic needs of non-human living things is not justified when the human needs that are at stake are non-basic or luxury needs. He calls this the principle of disproportionality (Sterba 2011: 168).

Robin Attfield concurs that killing other living beings in order to eat them is compatible with species egalitarianism, and so is killing large numbers of insects in cases of plagues (Attfield 2011: 140–141). Following Kenneth Goodpaster (1978: 311–312, 322–323), Attfield argues that, while all living things have equal moral standing, their *moral significance* can vary depending on their species-specific interests. And it is their moral significance that determines whose interests we should prioritize (Attfield 2011: 140). Note that Taylor himself, in *Respect for Nature*, after laying out his biocentric egalitarian framework, proposes various principles for settling inter-species conflicts that allow us to routinely prioritize the interests of humans over those of other living beings (Taylor 2011).

Gary Varner, while not himself a species egalitarian, argues that, from the perspective of a species egalitarian, it is permissible to favor the interests of some creatures over those of others as long as these creatures have relevantly different interests and we do not weigh their *similar interests* differently (Varner 2011: 172). Citing Peter Singer, he holds that we are only being speciesist if we weigh the *similar interests* of individuals differently (see Singer 2009: ch. 1). Mark Michael has previously made a similar argument. Again following Singer, he holds that equal consideration of interests often allows us to prioritize the interests of, say, humans over those of other living things, because harming a human usually frustrates more interests to a greater degree than harming a non-human creature in the same way (Michael 1997: 310).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Thus, all sides seem to agree that we have good reasons to treat living things differently based on their species-specific characteristics, such as their rational capacities or their capacity to feel pain. What is more, species egalitarianism's critics usually do not endorse a certain kind of old-fashioned anthropocentrism that legitimizes the ruthless conquest and exploitation of nature. The contemporary species inegalitarian is more enlightened than that. Schmidtz, for example, argues that we often have reasons to refrain from harming plants that are based in self-respect (Schmidtz 2011: 132–134). And Thomas Hill (1983) has influentially argued that a person who wantonly destroys nature is lacking in virtue. I wager that many species inegalitarians would also, to some extent at least, agree with Sterba's principle of disproportionality. One does not have to be a species egalitarian in order to agree that it is not okay to violate the basic needs of other living things for the sake of trivial human benefits (Anderson 1993: 362).

There is, thus, a host of things species egalitarians and inegalitarians seem to agree on—perhaps too much? Given the radicalness of the claim that all living things have the same inherent worth, shouldn't we expect the practical outlook of species egalitarianism to drastically diverge from that of the more commonsense-friendly species inegalitarianism? Perhaps, in trying to find common ground with their critics, species egalitarians have made concessions that are too big too soon.5 I do not mean to downplay the importance of Taylor's work and that of other species egalitarians. Biocentrism in general, and the rejection of human superiority in particular, constitute a powerful protest against a narrow anthropocentrism that was and still is widespread in the general population. In fact, it might even be unwise, from a pragmatic standpoint, to publicly advocate a more radical species egalitarianism when large parts of the population don't think that certain "lower" life forms have any moral standing whatsoever; doing so might alienate potential allies and *hinder* progress. At the same time, however, it may also be unwise to completely shut down certain lines of inquiry due to pragmatic considerations; if we do so, we might miss out on important insights that, in ways we cannot always foresee, find their way back into mainstream philosophy and even popular opinion. Hence, I invite the reader to consider that a more radical species egalitarianism may be more plausible than both species egalitarians and their critics have granted.

### **2. A More Radical Species Egalitarianism**

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

### 2.1 Carrots, Cows, Mice, and Chimps

All species egalitarians should agree *to some extent* that members of different species should be treated differently based on their species-specific characteristics, insofar as these characteristics determine whether something is good or bad for an organism at all (Taylor 2011: 149–150). For example, it is often good for sentient beings to be administered anesthetics, but a non-sentient being, such as a portobello mushroom, cannot benefit from painkillers. Likewise, a human can benefit from a right to free speech, but a skunk cannot.

However, in many cases in which we have to make trade-offs between the lives or well-being of two or more organisms, the treatment in question would benefit or harm both (or all) organisms involved. For example, being set on fire is bad for humans, squirrels, and sunflowers alike. In those cases, shouldn't species egalitarians hold that it is unjustified to favor the members of one species over members of another species? This point goes beyond the idea that we should consider individual beings on their own terms, rather than on grounds of their species membership. To clarify, some philosophers have argued that, because humans *typically* are rational agents, we should treat *all* humans with the respect that is due to a rational agent, even those humans that lack "normal" rational capacities. Others believe that we should attribute moral standing on a case-by-case basis, regardless of species membership, depending on the characteristics of *the particular individual*.6 However, what I am questioning here is whether capacities such as rational thought, moral agency, or sentience are grounds for favoring the interests of some over the interests of others at all.

Let's consider Schmidtz's example of the carrot and the cow. In response to Schmidtz, Sterba says that a species egalitarian can appeal to the consequentialist goal of minimizing suffering in order to justify killing a carrot over a cow (Sterba 2011: 169).7 Killing animals (as well as transporting them to slaughter) usually involves causing them physical pain as well as psychological distress, whereas carrots cannot be in pain or distress. A similar point could be made in response to another one of Schmidtz's examples (Schmidtz 2011: 130–131). Schmidtz asks what we would do if we could either save a drowning mouse or a drowning chimp and whether, in order to cure an otherwise catastrophic disease, we would rather conduct lethal medical experiments on mice or on chimps. According to Schmidtz, species egalitarianism implies that it does not make a difference whether we choose the chimp or the mouse, which Schmidtz finds "monstrous" (Schmidtz 2011: 131). Sterba would perhaps respond that, for a species egalitarian, favoring the chimp over the mouse is justified because, due to its more sophisticated capacities, the chimp would suffer more from drowning and from the medical experiments than the mouse.

In general, it is very intuitive that we should minimize suffering in our actions. However, I find the principle of minimizing suffering *more* intuitive in certain cases than in others. It's particularly intuitive when no lives are at stake and when the choice is between different kinds of actions, either treating A in a certain way x or treating B in a certain other way y, where x generally causes less suffering than y. For example, if I have to choose between kicking my downstairs neighbor in the shin (x) or waterboarding my upstairs neighbor (y), I should choose to kick my downstairs neighbor in the shin. Now, what if the treatment is the same in both cases and the difference in suffering would be due to certain characteristics *of A and B*? Suppose that I have to kick either my upstairs neighbor or my downstairs neighbor in the shin, but my upstairs neighbor bruises more easily. In that case, while I find this decision a bit more difficult, I should probably still choose my downstairs neighbor. But what if what's at stake is not a bruise and some mild pain but a life? Suppose, for example, you can save either person A or person B from painful death but not both. Both are begging you to save them. However, B has a variety of congenital insensitivity to pain that makes her indifferent to pain. You decide to save A because B will suffer less in the process of dying. Is this the right choice? Maybe you should have flipped a coin instead. After all, B does not want to die, either, and death is final. Is it okay to make a decision about who gets to *die* and who gets to *live* based on considerations about temporary suffering? In particular, is this kind of reasoning compatible with respect for persons? B might complain that it is not her fault that she was born with insensitivity to pain and that it is unfair to give her the short end of the stick simply because she was not born with a certain vulnerability. Likewise, we could complain on behalf of the mouse and the carrot that it is not their fault that they were born without the same kind of vulnerability as the cow or the chimp. Why should they get the short end of the stick because of that?

Now, William French has argued that it is precisely because some living things, such as humans or sentient animals, have additional vulnerabilities that their interests should be prioritized over the interests of less vulnerable beings (French 1995: 55–56). However, while, again, unequal treatment is certainly *often* justified when some of the parties involved are more vulnerable than others, this may not hold when it comes to matters of life and death.

In this context, let's also contemplate a possible scenario in which we encounter a highly sophisticated species of aliens. They have capacities that we cannot even comprehend. We do, however, understand that these capacities add a whole other layer of complexity and intensity to their experience of pain. What is more, even the "lower animals" on their planet are more sophisticated than us and, as a result, are more vulnerable to pain than us. Suppose these aliens realize that, in order to find a cure to a devastating disease, they can either conduct lethal medical experiments on the "lower animals" from their own planet or on us. They decide to choose us because doing so minimizes suffering. Is that a justification we have to accept? Maybe. But it's at least not obvious. Thinking about a case in which we would be the ones getting the short end of the stick might make us a little more sympathetic towards the mouse and the carrot.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

So much for raising some doubts about the significance that a species egalitarian should attribute to temporary suffering when it comes to decisions about life and death. But even if an appeal to minimizing suffering allowed us to conclude that we should kill a carrot over a cow when killing the cow would result in suffering, this leaves open the question of what we should do when we could kill the cow *painlessly*.

Perhaps there is another way to justify prioritizing the life of the cow over that of the carrot or the life of the chimp over that of the mouse, which has to do with the *value of a future*. Arguably, the death of a chimp deprives it and/or the world of more value than the death of a mouse. Perhaps this is what Danny Shahar is getting at when, in discussing Schmidtz's example, he writes: "If we allow the chimpanzee to drown, the world will be impoverished in ways that do not come to bear if we allow the mouse to drown. Chimpanzees bring things to the table which mice do not. . .[M]ore is at stake when they are involved" (Shahar 2011: 165). And, according to Christopher Knapp, due to its more sophisticated capacities, the continued existence of the chimp is more valuable *to the chimp* than the continued existence of the mouse is *to the mouse* (Knapp 2009: 175–176). A species egalitarian could perhaps hold that, while chimps and mice qua individuals do not have different degrees of worth or moral standing, their *futures* nevertheless differ in value.

However, one reason for species egalitarians to be hesitant to adopt this line of argument is that, when it comes to *humans*, there is something iffy about making decisions about life and death on the basis of how much value an individual's future holds. This is especially true when it is not the individual's fault that their future life is less valuable to them or enriches the world to a lesser degree than the future of other individuals. Take, for example, a person born into unfortunate circumstances and with a natural tendency towards depression who never manages to "make anything" of her life and who does not place a high value on her own life. Take, on the other hand, a person who was provided with an environment and a natural temper that allow him to develop his capacities to the fullest and to deeply cherish his existence. If one is already in the business of comparing the value of different living beings' futures, one would probably say that the second person's future is more valuable than the first person's. But prioritizing his life for that reason seems problematic. It certainly doesn't seem egalitarian.

Perhaps more importantly, the idea that members of some species have more valuable futures than members of other species moves us away from one of Taylor's most central arguments for species egalitarianism. Taylor extensively argues that species-specific characteristics, such as rationality or consciousness, that are often taken to ground superior worth are *not valuable from the perspective*  *of beings who don't have those characteristics* and that it would be arbitrary to favor our perspective over theirs. Thus, about human-specific characteristics, Taylor writes: "Other creatures achieve their species-specific good without the need of rationality, although they often make use of capacities that humans lack . . .For animals that neither enjoy thinking for its own sake nor need it for living the kind of life for which they are best adapted, it has no value" (Taylor 1981: 215–216). Pierson Tse brings up exactly this point in discussing Schmidtz's example of the carrot and the cow:

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

a carrot pursues its own good in its own way—it does not need to have the qualities and capacities that say a chimpanzee has—it does not need to swing from trees or fashion rudimentary tools or to think. It is complete in and of itself and needs nothing more to pursue its own good. Surely, then, any qualities or capabilities a carrot seems to lack is strictly due from looking at things from our perspective, and not the carrot's. Therefore, it is not a matter of who has what qualities and how much of them. Things like that matter only to us, not the organism itself. (Tse 2014: 109)

Of course, when Taylor and Tse speak of "the perspective" of a plant, this cannot be taken literally if having a perspective requires having a mind. But what we can take literally is the claim that a carrot is not *deficient* for its lack of rational thought or sentience. It is complete the way it is, and it would not be ennobled or elevated if we somehow "added" the capacity for rational thought to it (which might also make it into an entirely different being). There is, of course, no logical implication from the observation that the carrot does not need rationality in order to be perfect to the conclusion that rational beings do not have more inherent worth than the carrot. But, for me at least, it makes the claim to human superiority more suspicious.

*If* we buy into Taylor's point regarding inherent worth, then I think we also shouldn't judge one organism's *future* to be more valuable than another organism's, based on species-specific characteristics. A carrot's future does not *need* to contain, say, the experience of pleasure in order to be complete, just like our future does not need to involve photosynthesis to be complete. The continued existence of a flourishing carrot contributes perfect carrot-ness to the world, and the continued existence of a healthy cow contributes perfect cow-ness to the world; who are we to say that the one enriches the world more than the other or that perfect cow-ness is better *for the cow* than perfect carrot-ness is *for the carrot*?

### 2.2 Are We Vampires?

So far, I considered the questions whether it is worse to kill a sentient animal (cow) than to kill a plant (carrot) and whether it is worse to kill a cognitively more sophisticated animal (chimp) than to kill a cognitively less sophisticated animal (mouse). However, in many cases, there is, of course, a third option. Instead of experimenting on either the chimp or the mouse, we could choose to experiment on ourselves (perhaps via a lottery system) or to let the disease that is affecting us take its course. And, instead of killing and eating either plants or animals, we could choose to eat neither and let ourselves starve, or to eat a fruitarian diet and suffer the resulting effects on our health.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Thus, I now turn to the question of whether species egalitarians should hold that we are justified in killing other living beings in order to eat them. Let's first note that doing so cannot be justified by appeal to *self-defense* in most cases, since the animals and plants we eat usually have not aggressed against us. Nevertheless, species egalitarians generally argue that doing so is permissible, since it is necessary for self-preservation. Taylor argues that humans are allowed to kill for food because, if they did not, "they would in effect be sacrificing their lives" for the sake of animals or plants, and respect for nature does not require this (Taylor 2011: 293–295). Now, the language of "sacrifice" obscures what is really going on. Our "sacrifice" consists in refraining from killing a creature that has not aggressed against us; it is not like we are actively helping the creature in any way. Sterba's formulation of the self-preservation principle is less euphemistic: "Actions that are necessary for meeting one's basic needs or the basic needs of other human beings are permissible even when they require aggressing against the basic needs of individual animals and plants, or even of whole species or ecosystems" (Sterba 2011: 167).

Evidently, we do not endorse a corresponding principle of self-preservation when it comes to interactions between humans, which Sterba is well aware of (Sterba 1995: 196–197). For example, one of our basic needs is to have functioning hearts. Yet, we are not justified in kidnapping homeless people from another country to surgically remove and transplant their hearts. And if there's no more room in the neighbors' storm shelter when you arrive, you cannot just grab someone who is already in there, throw them out, and take their spot.

Sterba provides two reasons for why we are nevertheless justified in aggressing against the basic needs of non-humans for the sake of self-preservation. The first is: "favoring the members of one's own species to this extent is characteristic of the members of all species with which we interact and is thereby legitimated. . .[W]e are required to sacrifice the basic needs of members of the human species only if the members of other species are making similar sacrifices for the sake of members of the human species" (Sterba 1995: 197).

However, note that animals and plants, in fact, make this "sacrifice" all the time by refraining from attacking and eating us. When was the last time you were attacked by an animal that tried to eat you? At least if you live in an industrialized nation, in which wilderness and "civilization" are neatly separated, being attacked by wild animals is probably not part of your daily life. In fact, herbivores would not even eat us if they had a chance, and most plants don't need to eat *any living things* in order to survive, so have no interest in killing us. Again, it is important to emphasize that the "sacrifice" that Sterba is speaking of amounts to nothing more than refraining from killing. Of course, animals kill and eat *each other* as well as plants. But how does that justify that *we* are joining in and killing them, too? Now, there will be cases in which an animal does attack and try to eat a human. In those cases, it is of course fine for a human to defend herself. Furthermore, if you live in certain parts of the world, attacks by wild animals may indeed be part of your daily life, in which case you can be considered to live in a state of "mortal combat" with another species (Schmidtz 2011: 133–134). In that case, you are presumably permitted to treat members of that species like "enemy soldiers" and kill them. But this does not imply that, in a situation where animals neither individually nor collectively pose a threat to you or your community, it is okay to kill and eat them. Nor does it imply that we should try to *enter* a state of "mortal combat" with other living beings in order to acquire an excuse to kill them.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Sterba's second justification for holding that species egalitarianism is compatible with killing for food is that humans would otherwise go extinct "and fortunately, we have no reason to think that we are morally required to bring about our own extinction" (Sterba 1995: 198). But whether we do have a moral reason to go extinct, of course, depends on whether it is wrong for us to kill other living things in order to eat them, which is precisely the question at issue.

Now, it may look like I am constructing a reductio ad absurdum against species egalitarianism. After all, a view that implies that, in order to even continue our existence, we *have* to commit wrongs is surely wrong (see Sandler 2007: 73; Sterba 1998: 367). But I don't intend my argument as a reductio. The idea of having to commit wrongs in order to continue to exist is not itself absurd. In fact, that this possibility occupies our minds is evident when we look at pop culture and folklore. There are many movies in which one of the characters has to choose between either dying herself or bringing about the death of an innocent third party in order to survive. For example, in the original *Saw* movie, Amanda Young, trapped by the Jigsaw killer, is forced to either brutally kill a sedated stranger or accept her own horrible death. In the 2014 movie *It Follows*, characters are pursued by a supernatural entity that eventually kills them unless they pass on the curse to some other unfortunate soul. The view that these characters, in saving their own lives, are acting wrongly is debatable but certainly not absurd. Some fictional characters even need to kill *by their very nature* in order to survive. In many vampire stories, vampires are depicted as *needing* to kill humans and drink their blood in order to sustain themselves or their sanity. Nevertheless, arguably, it is still wrong for vampires (who appear to be moral agents just like us) to kill innocent people. But couldn't it be that *we* are "vampires"? That would certainly be tragic, but it does not seem outright absurd. We cannot just assume a kind of pre-established harmony in the universe that guarantees that all intelligent life forms can sustain themselves without committing any wrongs.

Now, creatures who, in order to live, have to commit wrongs, are put in the unfortunate position that they have to decide whether to give up their own lives or to continue their lives in the knowledge that they are wronging other beings. The latter is at least not an impossible way to live. It is probably psychologically feasible to live with this knowledge if one is at least making an effort to do no more harm than is absolutely necessary for self-preservation. It may also be helpful for a person to consider that, if she keeps on living, even though this requires her to do wrong, she may ultimately be able to do more good for non-human living beings (let alone humans) than if she allowed herself to starve or slowly deteriorate on a fruitarian diet.

### **Conclusion**

Unsurprisingly, I am uncomfortable with my own arguments. I share the intuition that it is worse to kill a sentient animal than to kill a plant. And I certainly don't like the idea that my own self-preservation necessitates wrongdoing on my part. Neither am I planning on advocating the extinction of the human species anytime soon. However, I also find something very compelling about the basic ideas of species egalitarianism, and it seems to me that these basic ideas take us into a more radical direction than species egalitarians themselves have been willing to pursue. Given that a serious debate regarding the moral status of non-sentient life in particular has taken off in Western philosophical thought only relatively recently, it seems premature to dismiss the more radical implications of species egalitarianism out of hand *simply because* they seem bizarre from the perspective of common sense. Instead, we might want to struggle with them a little more. We generally have the urge to make all parts of our moral thinking fit neatly together; moral intuitions either have to fit our overall moral outlook or are to be dismissed as irrational; bullets either have to be bitten or assumptions have to be revised—but something has to give in order to regain a state of reflective equilibrium. In general, this is probably a good disposition to have. However, perhaps we sometimes try to regain reflective equilibrium too quickly and end up forcing it, rather than properly thinking through the issues. Maybe it is sometimes a good thing to tolerate tensions in one's moral outlook and let them stew for a while (or longer) instead of quickly retreating into the comfort of moral certainty.8

### **Notes**

- 1. For a particularly lucid overview of the literature on biocentrism, see Palmer (2017). Note that there are *individualistic* and *holistic* versions of biocentrism (Nolt 2015: 163). The former hold that only individual living organisms have moral standing, whereas the latter attribute moral standing to entire ecosystems or biotic communities. In this
essay, the focus will be on individualistic biocentrism. For holistic biocentrism, see Leopold (1949), Callicot (1980).

- 4. Someone might object that animals die and suffer in the production of plant-based foods as well. For example, field animals may be killed during harvest, and insects are killed through insecticides.
- 5. In fact, some scholars have charged Taylor with outright inconsistency (Anderson 1993: 350; French 1995: 49–51). However, see Knapp (2009: 176).
- 6. For discussion of this issue, see, for example, Lombardi (1983: 263–264), Schmidtz (2011: 130–131), and Singer (2009: 48–54).
- 7. Schmidtz and Sterba couch this question as one about vegetarianism vs. omnivorism. I depart from this framing because species egalitarians could potentially advocate vegetarianism, *even if* it was just as bad to kill a plant as to kill a sentient animal. The increased intake of plant-based foods by vegetarians might be more than offset by a decrease in the production of plant-based animal feed, in which case vegetarianism would lead to fewer animal *and* plant deaths (see McPherson 2018: 214; Wills 2019: 257).
- 8. I am grateful to Dave Schmidtz for his invaluable encouragement, advice, and helpful feedback.
