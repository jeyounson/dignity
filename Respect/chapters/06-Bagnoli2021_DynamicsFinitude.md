*Carla Bagnoli*

It is a peculiarity of Kant's ethics that respect for persons is tied to respect for the moral law. The connection is provided by a brief argument, which is meant to establish that moral standing is tantamount to the capacity for self-legislation. An aspect of the argument which deserves fuller attention is the role ascribed to the moral feeling of respect for the law, which is singled out as the unique moral incentive, in contrast to incentives that sustain conformity to duty (MM 6:465).1 Contemporary constructivists have primarily focused on respect for others as a normative requirement, in the attempt to show that a formal construal of the practical standpoint suffices to justify duties to humanity (Hill 1994, 2000; Korsgaard 1996: ch. 4).

In this chapter, I attempt to show that Kant's conception of respect as a moral feeling is crucial to any constructivist theory of practical reason because it accounts for the subjective authority of moral cognitions understood as rational requirements, and the normative constraints that the recognition of others puts on rational deliberation. Respect names the specific sort of moral sensibility which enables finite and interdependent agents to feel bound to the moral law, and more generally make them capable to act on principle (G 4:401; C2 75–78; MM 6:399). The practical standpoint is formal and affective, and this double characterization is crucial to explain how objective reasons for action are generated. If constructivism advertises itself as an objectivist theory of meta-normativity, it cannot fulfill its promise without an account of moral sensibility marked by respect.

In section 1, I identify the basic features of respect as a moral ideal of mutual recognition, which is the normative core of Kantian constructivism. In sections 2–6, I illustrate that Kant's theory of respect as a moral incentive is an integral component of his constructivist conception of practical reason, which is designed to model the form of practical rationality in finite agents. Under this description, the main function of respect as a moral feeling is to establish that finite rational agents *can* take an interest in rational action, in addition to acting from interest. As the only moral incentive, respect provides an account of the subjective authority of moral obligations, which is necessary to prove their objectivity. In section 7, I criticize those contemporary constructivist theories which take "reflective endorsement" as the source of moral authority. In section 8, I argue that this mechanism supplants Kant's original theory of respect as a moral incentive, and that it is problematic in its own right. In section 9, I conclude that the theory of respect as a moral feeling is an ineliminable element of Kantian constructivism, whose absence compromises the constructivist account of practical reason and undermines its objectivist aspirations.

### **1. Respect as a Moral Ideal of Recognition**

Kant's conception of respect captures the idea that humans have a claim to full recognition insofar as they are persons, rather than because of their social status, skills, or merits.2 Respect does not track objective properties that one possesses, but it is the attitude by which equal moral standing is unconditionally recognized. Under this characterization, respect is a second-personal attitude, owed to persons and exacted from persons: it can be claimed in entering and sustaining personal interactions, and reclaimed if it is violated—even vicariously, or on behalf of others. According to Thomas Hill, this conception of respect "answers to a deep and pervasive human need beyond the more concrete needs that characteristically lead to demands for justice and charity" (Hill 1994: 3). Kant acknowledges that recognition of equal standing by others is a fundamental human need, which is key to properly organize dependency and relations of power. In contrast to honorific and substantive definitions of respect, Kant's characterization identifies the basic structure of moral agency in a form of reciprocity. Precisely in virtue of its formality, this characterization of recognition respect purports to unconditionally protect humanity. Thus, the ethics of respect is an ideal of moral agency. But it is also, and more fundamentally, an ideal of rational agency, which fits the specific profile of human agency, and is congruent with the self-conception at work in ordinary human moral thinking. This is one way to underline the originality and radicalness of Kant's ethical project (Rawls 2000: 207).3

Relating to others as persons entails distinctive responsibilities of reciprocity, which are not dependent on roles or positions. While abstract, the form of reciprocity inherent in respectful interactions is sufficient to ground normative rights and duties, draw boundaries between people, strike deals, and govern interactions among mature, competent, and conscientious adults (Hill 1994: 4). Relations governed by mutual respect are not merely optional or peripheral: they are the most fundamental forms of personal relations. In such relations, partners are taken to share in reason and count as sources of valid claims. They represent themselves and others as "members of the kingdom of ends," and under this representation, they relate to one another as co-legislators and independent origins of mutual constraints.4 The novelty of Kant's view lies in the equalitarian justification of respect, which stands in contrast to dogmatic, elitist, and religious approaches that base moral standing on character, natural talent, religion, power, or social rank (Hill 1994: 6–7). Kant's respect is based on dignity, but differently from honorific respect, it does not track any quantifiable property; it is not a matter of degree, nor is it commensurate with descriptive features of agency, special merits or accomplishments. Rather, it captures the form of mutual recognition and constraint (Hill 1994: 16).5 Importantly, the attribution of equal normative standing cannot be forfeited solely on the basis of irreducible moral differences. This makes respect unconditional and such that it cannot be denied without denying humanity itself. Such denial is a moral transgression and counts as a violation of a rational requirement, which binds a priori and with necessity.6 The feeling of respect does not undermine the a priori character of practical necessities, because its nature is not pathological, but it arises out of contemplation of the moral law. Though more is needed to ground particular duties, this defense suffices to justify duties to humanity, and moral prohibitions on servility and arrogance, self-degradation and self-conceit.

These are rather abstract claims, and the relation between respect as "reverence for the law" and "respect for persons" has been the focus of much debate and the source of profound dissatisfaction. Critics have objected that there is but a thin argument that connects respect understood as reverence for the moral law and respect due to persons insofar as they are capable of self-legislation.7 The link between reverence of the law and respect for persons is provided by the principle of autonomy, that is, "the idea of the will of every rational being as universal legislating will" (G 4:431), which yields the imperative "do everything from the maxims of one's will as one that can at the same time regard itself as universally legislating" (G 4:432). Most of this debate concerns the alleged inadequacy of construing respect for persons as an attitude due to their rational capacity alone: "The dignity of a person consists precisely in this capacity to make universal laws" (G 4:440). On this construal, respect as directed to persons may seem secondary or at least derivative, because it acquires importance only indirectly, as if the real object of regard were the moral law. I hope to clarify that the claim that respect for persons is justified in relation to reverence for the law does not make it derivative or, worse, secondary. Rather, respect for persons counts as a decisive specification of what it is for a finite agent to relate rationally with herself and others as rational finite agents. To establish this claim, we shall consider how respect defines the practical standpoint on action.

### **2. Respect and the Practical Standpoint**

Kant's constructivist account of practical reason targets rational but finite agents, and it is designed to show that and how such agents can be guided by reason in identifying the ends of action, in spite of their finitude.8 Thus, one could say that the very purpose of the constructivist view of practical reason is to address problems posited by finitude and interdependency, by an account of the subjective conditions of susceptibility to duty.9 Such problems concern coordination among persons with equal standing, and thus require solutions that block possible violation of equal standing.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Kant's notion of finitude comprises reference to embodiment, temporality, dependency, sensitivity to natural incentives, and fragility. In this rich sense, finitude challenges the very possibility of practical laws understood as laws of reason, by calling into question their capacity to bind and constrain human will.10 In a way, finitude makes room for the problem of the normative authority of such laws. But the problem also concerns the motivational structure of rational agents and, specifically, the subjective conditions of susceptibility to duty. Respect is the cardinal concept in this account of susceptibility. Respect for the moral law is the immediate recognition of its authority and immediate determination of the will by law. Respect is qualified in relation to reason, as a "feeling self-wrought by means of a rational concept"; in relation to moral motivation, as "the immediate determination by means of the law and consciousness of this determination"; and in relation to its impact on natural incentive, as "the representation of a worth that infringes upon my self-love" (G 4:401).11

Kant's argument is that reason is neither merely executive, nor is it driven by the passions; rather, the specific ends of action are generated through reasoning, and they are neither prior to nor independent of the activity of reason. The scope of reason is not limited to ratifying what nature promotes as good and it does not consist in an intellectual insight into goodness either. Finite beings cognize under limitations, not because their rationality is bounded or because they have a limited access to reality, but because their knowledge is constrained by concepts. Practical knowledge of what to do is shaped by concepts "of a necessitation (constraint) of free choice [*Willkür*] through the law" (MM 6:379). Through such concepts humans do not become directly acquainted with the moral law, but they become susceptible to its commands and thus capable of regulating their thinking and their acting in relation to the moral law (MM 6:389). Thus, to show that finite rational beings can act for the sake of morality one needs to account for the subjective conditions of susceptibility to duty. Such subjective conditions explain how humans can take an interest in acting for the sake of moral ends, rather than from interest: "Any consciousness of obligation depends upon moral feeling to make us aware of the constraint present in the thought of duty" (MM 6:399).12

This is a defining feature of Kant's theory of practical reason, which stands in contrast to all previous ethical views.13 These views cannot explain why moral obligations have objective and subjective authority for all rational beings because they fail to capture the autonomy of reason. The objection of heteronomy registers a failure to appreciate the constructive or generative powers of reason, that is, its practical function. Constructivists have heavily relied on Kant's argument for practical reason in their defense of the view that there are no moral facts and reasons prior to and independently of reasoning (Rawls 1980; Korsgaard 1996).

### **3. Rational Construction and Finitude**

To appreciate how the moral feeling of respect is relevant in the constructivist account of practical reason, we should notice that pure practical reason could take the form of intellectual insight. Arguably, infinite and disembodied rational agents do not experience morality in the guise of constraint or obligation; rather, for them the moral law is akin to a natural law, insofar as it is purely descriptive of what they spontaneously do (G 4:414). For finite rational beings, instead, the moral law is normative, that is, prescriptive and regulative.14 Because of their finitude, human agents do not discern the objective ends of action by an intellectual insight, but they find out that they start from a limited perspective on action and then move up to rational justification, which builds upon an agreement under undistorted conditions of rationality. As in the critical assessment of the powers of theoretical reason, we should consider the deliverances of practical reason by taking into account the limitations imposed by sensibility, if we are to understand and vindicate its significance. However, in the practical domain, the limitations associated with finitude do not have the same consequence as in the theoretical domain. While they certainly introduce specific challenges and complications, they are not merely sources of illusions or hindrances to morality.15 On the contrary, the peculiar and complex sensibility of finite and sensible agents allows for pure reason to achieve in the practical domain what cannot be achieved in the theoretical domain. Reason's striving toward the unconditioned is not an indication of its inadequacy or impotence, but of its normative status: the search for the unconditioned is the normative standard that regulates all its activities.

Thus, constructivism aims to vindicate the distinctive way in which reason works in finite agents. This presentation of the defining task of constructivism about practical reason emphasizes that rational construction requires a distinctive moral psychology centered on respect. This emphasis on the contribution of the moral feeling of respect is offered as a necessary corrective to current debates, which by and large identify the defining feature of Kantian constructivism with a formal method of construction. The only requirement for such a method is that it must check that the proposal of action can be willed as a law, according to the three complementary specifications of the categorical imperative. But to function properly, such a form must include an account of the subjective conditions of moral sensibility (Rawls 2000: 165; cf. Bagnoli 2011). Kant's view is that finitude does not make practical rationality bounded, although it makes the will weak and fragile.

Constructivism captures the basics of the reflective experience of frail, interdependent and mutually vulnerable agents, who are still capable of relating to one another as free and equal.

### **4. The Dynamics of Finitude**

Why *should* finite agents reason at all (Korsgaard 1997: 252; Korsgaard 2003: 117–118)?16 Part of the problem in responding to this question concerns the distinction between the "practical standpoint" on rational action, which is performed under the representation of freedom, and the "speculative standpoint," which represents agency under the category of causality. The naturalistic approach takes these standpoints to be in tension. Instead, the metaphor of construction is meant to capture Kant's unique understanding of the practical function of reason, without compromising the naturalistic understanding of the theoretical standpoint on agency. To fulfill this explanatory role, and account for the sort of practical rationality distinctive of finite agents acting in time, the metaphor of rational construction must rely on moral psychology.17 Rational finite agents act under the subjective representation of freedom, but this self-representation is not an implicit abstraction or unreflective intuition: it is an affective disposition which plays a motivational role by enabling rational agents to be perceptive of and responsive to reciprocity. This piece of the constructivist machinery is meant to make sense of and respond to the challenges posited by finitude.

Finitude does not alter the canon of practical reason, which remains the same across all forms of rational agency, finite and infinite; and so, it is inappropriate and misleading to talk of "bounded rationality" for human agents because it mischaracterizes the impact of finitude on rational agency. However, finitude does enter Kant's picture of rationality, and pervasively, as it directly affects the springs of action, which are sensible. For the finite being the satisfaction of needs is not a matter of self-content contemplation "but is instead a problem imposed upon him by his finite nature itself, because he is needy and this need is directed to the matter of his faculty of desire, that is, something related to a subjective feeling of pleasure and displeasure underlying it by which is determined what he needs in order to satisfy his own condition" (C2 5:25).

Unlike unreflective animals, humans are not merely driven by needs and inclinations, but act on them.18 Insofar as they are capable of reason, finite agents, can conceive of acting in two ways: by taking interest in action and by acting from interest: "The first indicates the dependence of the will on the principles of reason itself; the second its dependence on the principles of reason at the service of inclinations—that is to say, where reason merely supplies a practical rule for meeting the need of inclination. In the first case, what interests me is the action; in the second case, what interests me is the object of the action (so far as it is pleasant for me)" (G 4:413 n.14). Every action is moved by an interest, but taking an interest in action itself is what warrants moral worth, rather than conformity to the moral law (C2 5:71–87).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

These two forms of agency open to rational finite beings correspond to two forms of incentives, which account for the double form of motivation at work. Acting from pathological interest depends on the work of natural incentives, while taking interest in action requires reverence for the moral law. In the *Critique of Practical Reason*, Kant writes that respect is "*the* sole and undoubted moral incentive" (C2 5:78) and more precisely, not an incentive *to* morality but "morality itself *taken as* an incentive" (C2 5: 6, see also MM 6:399–402). The meaning and significance of the latter claim can be explained only by clarifying how the moral feeling of respect relates to the concept of practical reason. The contrast between incentives to morality and morality taken as an incentive is the basis of this explanation. Finite agents experience practical laws as normative constraints: Why do they obey?

Sensible nature provides finite agents with plenty of incentives, which function as *pro tanto* motives. Some such incentives may concur with and externally support moral conduct. For instance, agents may be motivated to comply with moral obligation by fear of sanctions, hope of future rewards, by seeking the esteem of others, or just through thoughtless deference. However, occasions often arise in which transgression escapes blame and virtue gains no rewards. Thoughtless deference may be put to test when moral conformity requires the agent to forego some of her plans and desires, and thus it is not a more stable incentive than interest. As a consequence, all such incentives make the rational agent motivationally unstable. To secure moral motivation, one must find an incentive that is stable across contexts despite the variability of interests and inclinations. Such an incentive must proceed from reason, since this is the only source that is unconditioned. For moral motivation to be stable across contexts, reason must be able to directly produce an incentive. Respect names such an incentive.19

In section 6, we shall consider in more detail how respect infringes upon and constrain natural incentives, thereby generating a complex account of moral motivation. But it is important to highlight at the outset that respect as a moral incentive figures prominently at the core of Kant's account of practical reason, and not as an external aid that drives finite rational beings to abide by the moral law. Rather, respect is a constitutive of practical reason as it takes place in finite agents. Consequently, the working of respect as the moral incentive is crucial to the constructivist account of practical reason because it is key to explaining the significance of its products as practical cognitions. To possess practical cognition of what to do is not to possess a piece of information that must be applied in practice when the occasion arises. Rather, possessing practical knowledge is productive of action, as it amounts to possessing normative reasons for action, which are felt subjectively as normative because of reverence for the law.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Focusing on this function of respect, one can appreciate that Kant's account of objective ends and his account of motives are complementary. In some places respect is defined as the "feeling of our incapacity to attain to an idea that is a law for us" (C3 5: 257–260; cf. C2 5:57). It might seem that the concept of respect conveys the very idea of limitation, insofar as it is the feeling of the distance that separates finite rational agents from the moral law. Because of its embodiment, human rational will is not only finite but fragile, naturally and incorrigibly inclined to depart from the moral law. At the same time, however, respect signals that such fragile agents feel bound by the moral law.

In the *Metaphysics of Morals*, respect is aptly described as a "capacity," instead of the perception of the incapacity to attend and realize the moral law, because it is a sensitive disposition that allows finite rational agents to be guided by pure practical reason. Respect is one of the four concepts grounded in sensibility that explain how finite rational agents can be susceptible to moral duty (MS 6:221, 399). Along with love of humanity, moral feeling, and conscience, respect enables finite rational beings to think and act morally. Since they are responsible for making the moral law operative in finite rational beings, it is important to regard them as subjective conditions of susceptibility to the concept of duty, rather than conditions of mere receptivity. There is an interesting contrast between respect and "moral feeling" proper, which indicates the susceptibility of free choice to be moved by practical reason (MS 6:400). Respect is the subjective aspect of reason which preempts and selects *pro tanto* motives, hence providing the dislodgement of obstacles and positively assisting the causality of reason.20 It is necessarily involved in self-legislation and thus it must operate at the stage of the formation of subjective maxims (MM 6:218), otherwise there would be objective necessitation but not subjective necessitation. This also indicates that self-legislation is always also co-legislation, as reverence for the law requires the recognition of equal moral standing.

According to this richer characterization, respect does not merely assist humans in their never-ending attempt to approximate the moral law, but rather it allows them to be concerned with the moral law, even though this remains a regulative ideal for them. In a sense, respect measures the distance from the moral law, but in another sense, respect puts us in relation to such a moral law, and explains how finite agents can take an interest in it.

### **5. Finite Agency, Divided Minds**

The life of the mind of finite agents is conflicted, and yet aspires to unity. Practical deliberation is the forum where such a unity is built, if only momentarily, and practical principles are the propositions that contain a general determination of the will. They are called maxims when they are subjective, that is, when their condition is considered by the subject as holding only for her will. They are called practical laws when they are objective, that is, when their condition is known to be valid for all rational beings. The skeptic denies that there are any practical laws, that is, practical principles valid for all rational beings. On this view, all principles capable of guiding the rational will are subjective maxims. If there are practical laws, rational finite agents will necessarily experience a conflict: they are "pathologically affected," that is, furnished with *pro tanto* motives that are grounded on sensibility, but they are also rational, hence capable of acting on principle and constructing reasons that are independent of sensibility (C2 5:19). Such normative reasons must gain normative force through the moral feeling of respect.21 It is via this feeling that humans are bound by practical laws. Kant illustrates the case with an example. A person can make his maxim to avenge every insult "and yet at the same time see that this is no practical law but only his maxim" (C2 5:19). When he realizes that his maxim cannot be transformed into a practical law, he experiences a conflict of maxims, hence a division within the will. The apparent effect of this division is the inability to undertake action: in order to act, the rational will must be unified.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Finite rational beings enter rational deliberation exactly because the objective ends of rational choice are not already determined nor ranked, either by reason or by desire. In the process of determining what to do, the finite rational will is not guided only by practical laws. On the contrary, the finite rational agent typically starts considering grounds for action that initially have little to do with practical laws. Take for example, a generic commitment to avenge insults. It is only by engaging in deliberation that the agent discovers that his maxim avenging every insult cannot be willed as a law. Perhaps, such a maxim could attain some generality on the assumption that this agent tests his maxim with kindred spirits, for example, enthusiasts of the code of honor. But this is not enough to meet the test of universality, which requires the rational agent to consider whether his maxim can be willed as a strict practical law, and hence holding for all rational agents. When the agent finds out that his maxim cannot be transformed into a practical law, he is of two minds about what to do. On the one hand, the subjective maxim commands him to avenge every insult and, on the other hand, the practical law rules out revenge as a ground for action. These are two clashing principles of the rational will. How and why does the practical law command the agent with subjective authority?

In order to address this question, Kant introduces some distinctions, which clarify the complex normative apparatus in place in the case of finite rational agency. It may seem that one can answer this question simply by relying on practical rules: "A practical rule is always a product of reason because it prescribes action as a means to an effect, which is its purpose" (C2 5:20). But in the case of finite rational agents endowed with sensibility, it is not sufficient to say that the agent has a practical rule. To be effective, the practical rule should become an *imperative*, which is expressed in terms of "ought." Unlike subjective maxims, imperatives are objective. Finite rational agents appreciate objective ends by reconstructing them as obligatory and authoritative.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Part of the answer to the problem of how objective ends are established as objectively valid and subjectively authoritative via rational deliberation depends on the characterization of practical principles that are not generated by reason alone, that is, material principles. In contrast to practical laws, material principles presuppose an object of desire. They are all empirical because their determining ground is the representation of the desirable object, which is related to pleasure and displeasure. Since no relation of pleasure or displeasure can be known a priori, then they must be empirical and cognizable only a posteriori. A second feature of all material principles is that they are all of the same kind, that is, they all belong to the general principle of self-love (i.e., one's own happiness).

Self-love is profoundly related to finitude and in a way that does not allow for alteration or reformation: "To be happy is necessarily the demand of every rational but finite being and therefore an unavoidable determining ground of its faculty of desire" (C2 5:25). Finite rational beings inevitably experience a conflict between the material principles grounded on self-love and rational principles. Given that this conflict is original and ineradicable, how to characterize the life of such agents? A natural answer to this question is that the mental life of finite rational agents is necessarily marked by division. But a fragmented mind lacks the sort of integrity that is necessary for the exercise of agency. If finitude involves a radical conflict between principles of action, then finitude is a threat to the very possibility of rational agency. The moral feeling of respect plays a crucial role in exiting this conflict, by functioning as a normative constraint.

### **6. Respect as Self-Governance**

To carefully consider the import of respect as a normative constraint, it is useful to contrast it with the normative role of sanctions and emotions. Both sanctions and emotions may play an auxiliary role by sustaining the efforts of the finite rational will to attain the moral law. Sanctions work as constraints insofar as they impose a prospective cost associated with the violation of moral obligations, and thus work as moral deterrents. The threat of a high fee may be the only way to discourage the scoundrel who wants to park on the sidewalk; but for more socialized agents, the same result may be achieved by the expectation associated with blame and praise, reproach and reward.

That motivation by ulterior motives is commonplace is something that Kant recognizes; he consistently relates such phenomena to the predicaments of finitude. While he is well aware of how crooked the timber of humanity is, he is also convinced that finite rational agents are capable of both categorical and instrumental reasoning. Finitude makes room for practical conflicts that infinite and disembodied agents would not experience, due to bounded cognition and fragility of the will, but it does not fundamentally alter the rational structure of the mind. Differently than rational beings as such, finite rational agents have to discipline themselves, and can do so in many ways. Sanctioning behavior and preemptive emotional costs, for example, fear of exclusion and punishment, are not the only way to explain why finite rational agents conform to practical laws, when they conflict with natural desires. Actions exacted by sanction conform to the moral law only externally, because they are based on the expectation of a result that is not the end of action (C2 5:76). By contrast, respect is a form of self-discipline that is not exogenous, but it is generated by the practical law, and hence it is not relative to and conditioned on anything sensible. Like sanctions, respect works as a normative constraint on deliberation, but unlike sanctions, respect is generated by the appreciation that something has the form of the law, not by fear of punishment or the prospect of reward. Like sanctions, respect constraints, but it does not aim at correcting, repressing, or punishing natural inclinations. The fundamental difference between these two modes of self-governance is that respect does not point to any ulterior motive in addition to the moral law.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

A similar argument applies in the case of actions elicited by emotions, such as parental love or compassion. Importantly, Kant denies that there are any "moral emotions," properly speaking, since emotions do not bear any intrinsic relation to the moral law, although they can be recruited in service of moral agency.22 Second, while he recognizes that some emotions may concur with moral motivation, he denies that they might contribute to reinforce moral motivation: their function is merely auxiliary (C2 5:152ff.; MM 6:402, 456–458). In such cases, emotions are "surrogates for the motive of duty," which facilitate action conforming to morality but do not interact or merge with the moral feeling of respect. In fact, when finite rational agents are motivated to act in conformity with morality only due to concurrent emotions, moral obligations fail to be genuinely authoritative (C2 72, 83, 85, 152–153, 156–157). This is a case of mixed motivation, not a case of overdetermination, nor are these integrated moral motives.

According to Kant, all philosophical theories that explain the authority of moral obligation by sanctions or emotions external to the obligation itself are self-defeating because they undercut the very concept of obligation. To say that moral obligation is compelling solely in virtue of the presence of concurring emotions or sanctions is to recognize that moral obligation is *not* obligatory per se and thus needs some external device in order to bind finite agents. When finite rational agents are driven by sanctions and emotions that provide them with ulterior motives, external to the motive of duty, they do not act under the representation of freedom (G 4:441). Likewise, moral obligations lose authority when they derive their normative force from thoughtless deference, dogmatic reliance on beliefs, uncritical adherence to conventions and ideologies. In short, all surrogates of reason undermine reason's autonomy and expose the rational agent's lack of genuine moral motivation.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

The role of respect is to establish that moral obligations are rationally binding: their contents are requirements of practical reason and they are binding through reason (C2 5:42, 72, 83, 85–86). Moral obligations are cognizable by all rational beings as such, albeit in different manners. In the case of finite rational agents, they become accessible and operative, that is, obligatory and authoritative, in the guise of respect. This argument is crucial to Kant's conception of reason as practical, that is, capable of influencing and directing the mind (C2 5:156, 157). Thus, the constructivist account of Kant's conception of practical reason must include an account of respect as its psychological counterpart. This is because it is the moral feeling of respect that shows how reason has a direct effect on the mind of finite rational agents. The very possibility of practical reason, that which is said to elude non-constructivist accounts, rests on the possibility of respect as the only moral incentive.

### **7. Respect and the Formality of the Practical Standpoint**

Constructivists largely agree that the merit of Kant's view is that it vindicates respect for others and self-respect as integral elements of the self-conception that is at work in ordinary moral thinking. Kant acknowledges that persons regard themselves as self-originating sources of valid claims, and the constructivist interpretation emphasizes that this reflexive claim plays a central role in his account of persons as independent sources of value (Rawls 1985, 1980: 452; Hill 1994: 14). Respect is a form of affective consideration and regard, which defines the practical stance from which persons undertake moral relations to one another. In carrying on Kant's legacy, constructivists have taken on a simplified view of respect: they have emphasized the formality of the practical standpoint, in order to differentiate Kant's rationalism from dogmatic and robust forms of moral realism (Korsgaard 1996; Street 2012. Against the canonical objections of empty formalism, which have threatened Kantian ethics since its birth, they have focused and developed Kant's conception of respect as the key normative principle which governs personal interactions and just institutions by constraining deliberation.23 But they have abandoned Kant's distinctive view of respect as the sole moral incentive.

One could speculate that contemporary constructivists may have at least two good reasons for this choice. The first may seem obvious: since respect for humanity is the normative core of Kantian deontic ethics, the focus on respect as a normative principle can be justified by the practical vocation of constructivism as a moral theory. The second reason is more technical, and concerns the fact that Kant's theory of moral incentive rests on a distinction between moral and pathological feelings that many find both problematic and obsolete because it is grounded on transcendental psychology, at odds with an up-to-date empirical psychology.

My worry is that the Kantian constructivist account of practical reason cannot be fully vindicated by leaving behind the moral feeling of respect as motor of moral motivation. By setting aside respect as a moral incentive, constructivists overlook Kant's most original insight, which is that for finite agency the practical standpoint is both formal and affective (Bagnoli 2011). This claim is crucial to Kant's distinctive account of the objectivity of moral obligations, and deserves to be developed and supported by a plausible psychology.24

In the final sections, I shall argue that Kant's approach to the springs of action is more promising than the devices so far exploited by contemporary constructivists, centered on reflective endorsement.

### **8. Moral Authority by Reflective Endorsement**

I have argued that Kant's view of respect as a moral incentive is meant to explain the subjective authority of moral obligation, and represents the subjective aspect of practical reason. Thus, absent this aspect of Kant's ethical theory, the question arises how moral obligations could be subjectively binding and authoritative. Constructivists are not insensitive to this issue. On the contrary, a purported merit of Kantian constructivism is that it explains moral authority more convincingly than realism or expressivism do (Korsgaard 1996).25 But some constructivist theories address moral authority by relying on a concept that is alien to Kant's vocabulary, that of *reflective endorsement*. A paradigmatic case is Christine Korsgaard's theory, which identifies reflective endorsement as the basic mechanism of rational agency, which explains how social identities become sources of normative reasons for action (Korsgaard 1996: Lectures II and III). Along similar lines, Thomas Hill writes that "endorsement under conditions of reasonable reflection, not mere sentiment, is what grounds values" (Hill 1994: 14–15). Reasonable reflection allows for the impartial selection of reasons for action, while endorsement accounts for their bindingness (Hill 1994: 14–15; Hill 2002: 7, 68, 72; Hill, 2000: 132–133, 250). On this reading, it is the structure of reflection that allows for the normative authority of duties to humanity. Adapting Rawls's definition, Hill characterizes reflection with the thick qualifier "reasonable," which is meant to capture the Kantian view of rationality, in contrast to the thin usage of the term that is prevalent in current action theory and theory of rational choice.26 Reasonable reflection does not determine any specific moral domain but governs relations to others in specific ways, namely, by constraining individual preferences, projects, and interests, in light of "whatever basic framework for human interactions would be accepted by reasonable, autonomous, and mutually respectful persons" (Hill 1994: 16).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

The rationale behind the argument that imports a device alien to Kant's theory of rational agency is the attempt to avoid metaphysical commitments in accounting for the source of value.

[O]n the Kantian perspective the ultimate source of human values is not Platonic forms, natural teleology, God's will, or universal human sentiment. Ultimately all that is valuable for us stems somehow from the reflective endorsements of human beings. Particular ends, means, ground projects, discovered delights, joint endeavours, social networks, and histories are valued differently by different individuals and cultures. But the common framework Kant proposes as worthy of reflective endorsement by all is a basic requirement, across cultures and individual differences, to respect every human being as a source of value.

(Hill 2002: 77)

Reflective endorsement names an impartial process by which the contents of moral reasons for action are constructed and, then, adopted. It is double-stage: first, the agent reflects according to the canon of reason, and then endorses whatever survives reflection. It is reflection itself, insofar as it is guided by the categorical imperative, which represents the ultimate source of normative authority. What is the role of endorsement, then? My speculation is that endorsement accounts for subjective normative authority. It explains how it is that finite subjects, endowed with needs, desires, and interests, can take up an interest in acting morally. If this is correct, then endorsement does the work that respect plays in Kant's account of moral motivation. This substitution may be treated as a welcome corrective to Kant's theory of respect, since it plainly avoids any transcendental psychology. However, this is not a minor adjustment to Kant's theory of moral authority. In fact, it presupposes a rather different understanding of the practical standpoint on rational agency.

The model of moral authority centered on reflective endorsement is a psychological test, which comprises two stages because it acknowledges a gap between reflection and moral motivation.27 The stance of reflection is not itself "practical," but precedes action. Thus, once the reflective agent has reviewed her reasons for action, the practical question arises on which reason she will act. Ultimately, this model transforms Kant's claim about the rational necessity of moral obligations into "inescapability," a sort of volitional necessity. Moral authority is depicted as the result of a psychological survey, and it remains unclear how reason governs agency all the way down to action. So, the model invites the objection that Kantian constructivism does not preserve the aspiration to ethical objectivity, which is a defining task of Kant's ethical theory. It better qualifies as a subjectivist form of voluntarism, rather than as an objectivist theory of practical reason (Hill 1994: 62; Korsgaard 2008: 294–297).28 Furthermore, in separating the stages of reflection and action, this model does not serve constructivism well, as it fails to answer the question that constructivism is designed to address, about the universal and categorical authority of moral obligations. The metaphor of construction is deflated and underplayed, in favor of less promising metaphor of detachment and endorsement, Thus, it becomes difficult to see how constructivism improves as it promises upon competing accounts of moral obligations. In fact, by way of reflective endorsement, this theory condemns itself to a dangerous instability: it shares the weaknesses of subjectivist theories as it disregards the aspiration of ordinary moral judgment to universal authority; it shares the weaknesses of standard rationalism, in that it represents reflection as affectively disengaged; and it shares the weakness of standard realism, in that it rescinds the links between moral thinking and agency.29

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

In the face of these difficulties, we are better off reconsidering Kant's own model of subjective authority, which appreciates moral sensibility not as a surrogate of duty but as its subjective aspect. For the purposes of an objectivist account of practical reason, Kant's model of respect as a moral incentive is preferable to the model of reflective endorsement, and for two reasons. The first is that it avoids the objection of subjectivist voluntarism, though it duly recognizes that there is a subjective aspect of practical reason. Second, it coheres with the phenomenology of moral choice and vindicates the affective dimension of the sort of self-conception at work in ordinary moral thinking. If so, then, the notion of respect should be recognized as the centerpiece of the constructivist account of moral cognitions as universal practical cognitions.

### **9. Conclusion**

On Kant's theory, respect defines the practical standpoint as both formal and affective. Its role is twofold: it explains how finite agents could become interested in acting rationally, and it explains how they act rationally, despite the pressure of natural incentives. In short, it is both an incentive (indeed, the only moral incentive), and a normative constraint. Under the former characterization, respect identifies the specific motivation that is characteristic of acting under the idea of freedom. Under the latter characterization, respect constrains the reasoning that justifies action. It requires that rational agents reason by considering others as co-legislators. In deliberating about what to do, rational agents ask whether their particular incentive can be willed universally, hence including all relevant others to bear on such reasoning. I have argued that under both descriptions, respect is a necessary complement of the constructivist account of practical reason. Those constructivist theories that dispense with respect and dismiss its role as a moral incentive, e.g. by relying on reflective endorsement, are at a significant disadvantage in providing for an objectivist defense of the subjective authority of moral obligations.30

### **Notes**

- 1. Respect for the law in its subjective aspect is called moral feeling. Citations from Kant's works are by volume and page numbers of the Academy edition of *Kants gesammelte Schriften* (Berlin: De Gruyter, 1902–). The English translations are thus abbreviated: G: *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals* (Cambridge University Press, 1998); C2: *Critique of Practical Reason* (Cambridge University Press, 1997); C3: *Critique of the Power of Judgment* (Cambridge University Press 2000); MM *The Metaphysics of Morals* (Cambridge University Press, 1996).
- 2. This view of respect roughly coincides with "recognition respect" as defined by Darwall (1977). See also Hill (1994: chs. 1, 2, and 11). On the recognitional aspects of respect and the boundaries of moral community, see Bagnoli (2007).
- 3. On the Kantian view of finitude and vulnerability, see, especially, O'Neill (1989).

- 5. On the idea of human dignity, see Hill (1992, esp. chs. 2 and 10).
- 6. This notion of practical necessity (and its subjective dimension) differ significantly from Korsgaard's notion of inescapability, cf. Korsgaard 1996.
- 7. For an excellent account of duties of humanity, see Sensen (2013).
- 8. As a corrective to common readings of Kant's conception of reason as otherworldly, self-sufficient, and timeless, some recent studies have highlighted Kant's concern with finitude by calling attention to his study of empirical subjects, see for example Louden (2000), but also Frierson (2005).
- 9. Recent studies have underscored how Kant's account of reason preserves the features of responsiveness and interdependency that are characteristic of the human condition, stressing the ambivalence of Kant's ethics. For instance, Sweet recognizes that Kant's approach to our finitude "may be seen to be unique in the history of philosophy" but emphasizes its paradoxicality, in that it "preserves our finitude and perpetually encourages to think its dissolution" (Sweet 2013: 10). My contribution in this chapter is that the paradoxicality vanishes when we appreciate the complex (normative and motivational) role of respect as a moral feeling.
- 10. C2 5:42, 151–153, 156–157. This is part of the ambitious plan presented in *Doctrine of Method*, which aims to prove that (a) the laws of pure practical reason govern the human mind and influence subjective maxims (5:151); (b) objective practical reason can be made subjectively practical (5:151, 153, and 157); and (c) it is possible to produce not only mere conformity to moral duty (legality of actions), but also the "*morality* of dispositions" (5:151).

- 11. Reath calls this the intellectual or practical aspect of respect, but notices that it is also affective or emotional: "Though the practical and the affective aspects of respect at first sight seem quite different, Kant does not keep them apart. In fact, he seems to devote effort to showing that they are the same thing" (Reath 2006: 10).
- 12. These are the subjective conditions of our moral susceptibility to duties (MM 6:399–402).
- 13. G 4:441–444; C2 5:35–41, 153, 157.
- 14. G 4:397, 414. One should further specify whether the moral law is prescriptive or regulative.
- 15. They certainly are also sources of illusions, mainly narcissistic, and related to self-love, see C2 5:74–75. Duty pertains to finite rationality and it characterizes the human condition insofar as it is "under certain limitations and hindrances" (G 4:397).
- 16. For a critique of the Kantian constitutivist argument, see Street (2012: 40–59), and cf. O'Shea (2015).
- 17. Cf. Rawls 2000: 153.
- 18. "Contrary to what is occasionally said, there is no such thing in Kant as an action from reason alone, if that means an action without a moving interest. . .This is true in Kant as it is in Hume" (Rawls 2000: 178).
- 19. "Actions done from duty are actions done from respect or out of respect for the moral law" (G 400–401). "Respect is, by definition, the recognition of a principle of volition as a law for us, that is, as directly determining our will without reference to what is wanted by our inclinations" (Rawls 2000: 153).
- 20. "This dislodgment of an obstacle is, in the judgment of reason, equally esteemed as a positive assistance to its causality" (C2 5:75). See also C2 5:79.
- 21. On the role of respect in establishing ethical objectivity, see Bagnoli (2015).
- 22. On the complexity of Kant's treatment of emotions in relation to agency, see Sherman (1996).
- 23. "The Kantian moral perspective implicitly contains within it an important, though relatively formal, requirement of respect. In accepting moral constraints as what, ideally, all human beings would agree upon in reasonable joint deliberations, we are, in a sense, respecting each person as a potential co-legislator of the basic principles we must all live by" (Hill 1994: 55–56).
- 24. Constructivists have often turned to Aristotle or Hume, for a better account of moral psychology, see Korsgaard 1996, Herman 1993, Sherman 1996, cfr. McCarty 1993, Frierson 2005. However, recent developments in empirical psychology have made room for a moral sensibility marked by reflexivity, which is congruent with Kant's view of respect; but this is an issue that I must set aside.
- 25. This claim is contentious (see Stern 2013).
- 26. Rawls takes reasonable to mean "judicious" or "ready to listen to reason" (Rawls 2000: 164; see also 230–231, 240–241). Rawls notes that Kant takes for granted that the CI presupposes a certain moral sensibility and a capacity for moral judgment (MM 6:399–400).
- 27. "The test for determining whether an impulse is a reason is whether we can will acting on that impulse as a law. So the test is a test of endorsement" (Korsgaard 1996: 108). Hill relates valuing and reflective endorsement so as to differentiate valuing from desiring (Hill 1994: 23). But the view remains dangerously unstable, precisely because it exploits

devices that are foreign to Kantian ethics and that undermine the constructivist approach to the practical function of reason.

- 28. Indeed, Korsgaard claims that "values are created by human beings" and this is "a matter of making laws" (Korsgaard 1996: 112). Korsgaard takes this view to coincide with Kant's: "In both Kant's version and mine the subject is unequivocally the author of the law" (Korsgaard 1996: 236); but Kant distinguishes between legislator and author, see MM 6:227. Korsgaard's treatment of practical reflection is ambivalent: there is a tension between the appeal to reflective endorsement, which builds on Humean materials, and the constitutivist claims, which instead assumes a thicker metaphysical view and is more ambitious about normativity, as in Korsgaard (2008: section 7.5.1).
- 29. For a critique of these neo-Kantian arguments as akin to bootstrapping, see Herman (2008: 164–175). Herman objects that these arguments fail to secure the bridge from agency to morality at all (see Herman 2008: 173). I am pressing the case that they also misconceive of the relation between reflection and action, because they ultimately rely on a theoretical account of practical reason.
