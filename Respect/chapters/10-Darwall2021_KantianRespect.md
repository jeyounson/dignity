#### *Stephen Darwall*

In "On the incentives of pure practical reason" in the second *Critique*, Kant is concerned with the empirical determinants of moral action. An action can have "moral worth" only if "the moral law determine[s] the will immediately" (Kant 1997: 5:71). But how can this happen empirically? What is the empirical psychology of action that does not "merely . . .fulfill the *letter* of the law," but also "contain[s] its *spirit*" (Kant 1997: 5:72)? How is free action "immediately" on a law of pure practical reason possible in the empirical ("phenomenal") world?

For Kant, all phenomenal events must have phenomenal causes. This is guaranteed transcendentally, since anything empirical, any possible object of experience, must be conceived through the category of causation in space and time. This is no less true of actions than it is of anything that can be experienced in time. It follows for Kant that however much a moral action must be a product of free practical reason, its empirical manifestation must nonetheless be empirically caused.

Kant's candidate for this cause is the feeling of *respect*. When we freely choose to do something because morality, the moral law, requires it, we are moved by the feeling of respect. Kant calls this an a priori feeling, since its existence can be established on a priori grounds (Kant 1997: 5:79). That there must be some such feeling follows from the fact that if moral actions, determined "immediately" by a law of pure practical reason, are to manifest themselves empirically, they must have empirical causes, and this would have to be a feeling of some kind.

Kant calls an "incentive" "the subjective determining ground of the will of a being whose reason does not by its nature necessarily conform with the objective law" (Kant 1997: 5:72). Only finite, spatiotemporal beings are subject to incentives; a "divine will" is not (Kant 1997: 5:72). But although incentives operate through empirical (felt) causes by definition, the "determining ground" of the agent's will, what we might call the *reason for which* the agent acts, is not the empirical feeling itself. "Respect for the law is not the incentive to morality; instead it [respect] is morality itself considered as incentive" (Kant 1997: 5:76). Moral action done "from duty," or because the moral law requires it, expresses itself in the empirical world as action done from respect. It is through respect that the moral law manifests itself empirically and so can give rise "immediately" to moral action.

I mention these matters of Kantian critical philosophy and action theory so that we can be aware of the philosophical context in which Kant's account of respect arises in the *Critique of Practical Reason*. In what follows, however, my interest will be squarely on Kant's account of respect itself. More specifically, I want to examine some details of what Kant says about the *phenomenology* of respect: how it occurs, how it feels, and the like. As I see it, Kant's description of the psychology of respect as a moral feeling, and how it relates to other forms of respect as a social phenomenon, is both fascinating in itself and highly revelatory of important features of his account of respect.

In particular, I want to focus on the following remarkable passage, which occurs relatively early in the chapter:

[B]efore a humble common man in whom I perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am aware of in myself *my spirit bows*, whether I want it or whether I do not and hold my head ever so high, that he may not overlook my superior position. Why is this? His example holds before me a law that strikes down my self-conceit when I compare it with my conduct, and I see observance of that law and hence its *practicability* proved before me in fact. (Kant 1997: 5:77)

"Humble," "common," and "superior position" all signal that Kant is here contrasting moral respect with the form that respect takes in recognizing *social status*. The passage comes directly after Kant's quotation of a saying of Fontenelle's: "*I bow before an eminent man, but my spirit does not bow*" (Kant 1997: 5:76).1 Bowing is an essentially social form of respect. It is a form of deference that supports or honors, and thereby helps constitute, a (high) social status. It is a species of *recognition respect*, *honor respect*, as I have elsewhere called it, that is the very medium through which hierarchies of honor and status are socially constructed (Darwall 2013). To be "eminent" or to have "superior position" just is to be recognized as such through others' (publicly) treating one as having that status, for example, by bowing. Presently, we shall explore the significance of this contrast between (forms of) moral respect and honor respect, but first we should lay out some general distinctions that we shall need.

### **1. Two Kinds of Respect: Recognition and Appraisal**

I take the term *recognition respect* from my original article on respect, which distinguished between two kinds of respect in general, recognition respect and appraisal respect (Darwall 1977). We recognize, and in that sense respect, something or someone when we take appropriate account of it in our treatment of or our conduct toward it. We respect laws or people's wishes, by conforming or deferring to them, a trusted expert's opinion or advice, by taking account of it in our own deliberations about what to believe, and so on. *Appraisal respect*, by contrast, is a form of esteem. It is a positive evaluative attitude toward a person in light of how he or she conducts herself, either in general or in some specific capacity, which need not entail any particular kind of treatment.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

To get the contrast, suppose there is an entomologist you greatly admire (as an entomologist, not for her extra-entomological activity). In addition to admiring her knowledge and entomological expertise, you might respect her as an entomologist in two quite different ways. You might have appraisal respect for her as an entomologist; that is, you might esteem the way she conducts herself in this capacity. Respect of this kind (appraisal respect) would show itself in your attitude toward her, perhaps in desires to emulate her virtues, and so on. But there is a different kind of respect, recognition respect, that you might also have for her as an entomologist and for her entomological authority. This recognition respect would show itself not so much in any appraising attitude toward her, but in your treatment of her as an entomologist, most obviously by deferring to her entomological opinions, by taking account of them in forming your own, and the like.

The distinction between recognition and appraisal respect is a distinction between two kinds of respect that is perfectly general and neutral with regard to topic or subject matter. Recognition respect can be for objects as lofty as the moral law or the dignity of persons, or for such mundane matters as a tennis opponent's backhand. You respect either by how you treat and take account of it in your actions toward it, taking care not to tread on others' rights, on the one hand, or to keep your shots to your opponent's forehand side of the court, on the other. Similarly, you can have appraisal respect for someone as a (moral) person or for how they conduct themselves in some specific pursuit such as tennis. But even in the latter instance, (appraisal) respect for someone as a tennis player differs from esteem for just any feature of her tennis. It is for how she conducts *herself* in playing tennis rather than, say, for the power of her serve or the deftness of her drop shots.

Distinguishing these two kinds of respect, recognition and appraisal, is essential to diffusing the apparent paradox that, on the hand, whether someone deserves (moral) respect depends upon his character and conduct, but, on the other, all persons are entitled to respect just by virtue of having certain basic capacities that fit them for moral agency even if their conduct and character is morally bad. The paradox dissolves once we realize that the kind of respect everyone can demand is recognition for the rights and privileges of (human) moral agents or persons, and the kind of respect that must be earned or deserved through conduct and character is appraisal respect or moral esteem (Darwall 1977).

So we have a general distinction between two different kinds of respect, one consisting in a form of *treatment*, the other in an *appraising attitude*. Because, however, each of these kinds of respect, recognition and appraisal, can have a variety of different kinds of objects, there are also different species of both recognition and appraisal respect. *Moral recognition respect* consists in treating someone as a moral person, taking proper account of that moral status in our relations toward her. Recognizing someone's eminence or superior social position, for example, by bowing, is also a form of recognition respect, though one that differs from moral recognition respect. It consists entirely in public "performances" that defer to or recognize, and thereby help constitute, social status. It is an essentially public recognition respect that we can call *honor respect*. And we can, as well, speak of (recognition) respect for various kinds of authority: legal, moral, epistemic, and so on. Finally, as our tennis example shows, there is yet another kind of recognition respect that consists in appropriately recognizing something's *powers*, for example, by taking seriously your opponent's power to beat you with her backhand. This is the same kind of thing as when climbers talk about respecting the mountain or when people in a hurricane's path "respect Mother Nature" by boarding up their windows.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

In a sufficiently broad sense of "power," recognition respect may always be for a power of some kind or other. Moral recognition respect involves recognition of a person's moral powers—essentially normative powers to claim, expect, or demand certain forms of treatment. Honor respect is recognition of social power. Authorities, whether de jure or de facto, can also be conceived as powers, de jure and de facto, respectively. Finally, what we might call *pure power respect* consists in taking due account of powers pure and simple.

As there are different species of recognition respect, so also are there different varieties of appraisal respect. Appraisal respect of any variety consists in a positively appraising attitude, esteem, for how someone conducts herself. This can either be in general, *moral appraisal respect*, or in some specific area, as a teacher, as a colleague, as a parent, and so on.

Thus, finally, there are two kinds of moral respect. *Moral recognition respect*: recognition for someone's dignity and powers as a moral person: to take responsibility for themselves and to be treated in certain ways by others. And there is *moral appraisal respect*: moral esteem for someone's conduct and character.

### **2. Honor as a Form of Recognition Respect**

Fontenelle says that he bows before an eminent man. Bowing is a form of honor respect, and eminence just consists in being "paid respect" in such ways, especially by those who also occupy positions of honor. Both moral recognition respect and honor respect are respect for *persons*, but in two very different senses of "person."2 Whereas moral recognition respect is for the moral person (a fellow member of moral community who is likewise subject to the moral law), honor respect is for someone's *persona*, that is, their particular self-presentation or social "face" (Goffman 1959, 1982). When God or the law is said to be "no respecter of persons," the relevant sense of "person" is *persona*. The thought is that God and the law take no account of rank and status. Taking no account of persons in *this* (persona) sense is part of what it is to have moral recognition respect for (moral) persons as such.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

The guiding idea of honor respect is that of a social role, an essentially public "character" or "figure," which actual individuals seek to "play" by presenting themselves socially in that role or character. Others are then called upon to situate themselves and their (would-be) characters or roles in relation to them. In so doing, they constitute, in effect, a social play or drama ("all the world's a stage") consisting in a kind of collective pretense or "make believe" in Kendall Walton's sense (Walton 1990).3 When others "support" our self-presentation by taking it seriously and honoring it, they become "supporting actors" to us. If they refuse to take our self-presentation seriously—if they ridicule or otherwise belittle it—then this dishonoring puts in jeopardy our actually occupying the social role or status we wish to occupy.

Fontenelle says that though he bows before an eminent man, his "spirit does not bow." This makes an important point. A status of eminence need not be jeopardized by insincere expressions of honor. So long as his bow is *performatively received* by the *characters* in the make-believe world of the social drama *as* sincere, whether or not it is sincere or is even believed to be, that is enough to make it a genuine case of honor respect and to confirm or further enhance the eminent social status of the actual individual to whom the bow is made. Of course, if its insincerity is itself made public, that can undermine a bow's social significance. If, for example, Fontenelle were to bow but at the same time *publicly assert* that his spirit is not, that would be something like damning with faint praise. It would amount to an insulting dishonoring. But here again, it would not matter what was actually going on in Fontenelle's head or heart or in those of his audience. All of the socially significant "action" goes on in public.

In his insightful history of honor cultures, James Bowman gives an especially vivid example from Mallory's *Morte d'Arthur* (Bowman 2006). Virtually everyone in Camelot knows that Launcelot is violating his oath of fealty to Arthur by having an affair with Guenevere. But no one dares to speak of the liaison publicly to Launcelot's face, since that would "invite Launcelot, whose fighting prowess makes him the most honorable of all knights, to call him a liar," and "the charge of lying against any knight would in turn have obliged that knight to challenge Launcelot to a single combat to the death, or else to be forever dishonored himself as one who has allowed himself to be 'given the lie' . . .without a fight" (Bowman 2006: 42). As Bowman observes, "Malory portrays a system of honor in which what is known privately by everyone nevertheless does not matter or even exist, in some important sense, so long as it is not spoken of publicly" (Bowman 2006: 42).4 One might think that traditional honor codes must actually value truth and truth-telling, since they generally make lying the most serious offense. But the fact is actually the opposite, as in Mallory's Camelot. There intimidation is not only an obstacle to inquiry; it actually determines socially relevant honor "truths" in a way that is impervious to the actual facts. Were a knight to respond to a challenge from Launcelot as though it were a charge he could answer with evidence, he would dishonor himself.

More finely analyzed, there is actually a distinction between honor respect paid within the make-believe, status-, and role-defined social world, on the one hand, and honor respect of actual individuals who are attempting to play roles in that world, on the other. The Vicar of Wakefield in Oliver Goldsmith's eighteenth-century novel describes "a young gentleman" who approaches the vicar's daughters with "a careless, superior air."5 "Seem[ing] to want no introduction. . .[he] was going to salute my daughters as one certain of a kind reception" (Goldsmith 1806: 22). The vicar adds, however, that this approach was successfully rebuffed, since his daughters "had early learnt the lesson of looking presumption out of countenance" (Goldsmith 1806: 23).

Someone is "looked out of countenance" when the look his presented self or social "face" receives is so unwelcome as to make his occupying the social role to which he aspires unsupportable. The look emanates both from the vicar's daughters, in actual fact, and from their "characters." But its object is not so much the character the "young gentleman" presents himself as, as the actual individual who is attempting to have that character. It forces him to change character, from someone who needs no introduction to a more modest approach, seeking introduction. In being looked "out of countenance," he is forced to change his social face. Though his status as a gentleman may still be intact, he can no longer present himself as one who can presume familiarity and needs no introduction.

The contrary of honor respect is (performative) contempt. Like honor respect, contempt can be shown both within a mutually acknowledged role-defined social world or to actual individuals attempting to occupy specific roles in that world. The vicar's daughters' looks are examples of the latter sort; they disable the young gentlemen's presumptuous performance. The daughters may lack the higher social standing that contempt generally presupposes (after all, they are only a vicar's daughters), but they occupy higher ground in this instance precisely because they are a vicar's daughters. Contempt expressed wholly within a social drama is of superior characters acting toward inferior ones in ways that confirm their respective social positions.

The passage from Kant to which we can now return provides an excellent example. Kant tells us, first, that unlike Fontenelle who bows before an eminent man but whose "spirit does not bow," his (that is, Kant's) spirit *does* bow before a "common, humble man." And Kant adds that his spirit bows, "whether I want it or whether I do not and *hold my head ever so high, that he may not overlook my*  *superior position*" (Kant 1997: 5:77; emphasis added). The part I have italicized exemplifies performative contempt *within* a social drama. Holding one's head high so that a social inferior "may not overlook" one's superior position "puts" an "inferior" individual "in his place." It places the contemned in the difficult position of having either to acquiesce in this inferiorizing characterization or to attempt to challenge it, perhaps by trying to look Kant out of countenance. To do the latter, however, might invite a contest of relative power not unlike the joust to which challenges to Launcelot would have given rise in Camelot: "Who are *you* looking at," as they say.

### **3. "Before a Common Humble Man...My Spirit Bows"**

Now that we have a richer conceptual framework to help us appreciate the complexity and insight of Kant's passage, let us have it before us again so that we can analyze it more fully:

[B]efore a humble common man in whom I perceive uprightness of character in a higher degree than I am aware of in myself *my spirit bows*, whether I want it or whether I do not and hold my head ever so high, that he may not overlook my superior position. Why is this? His example holds before me a law that strikes down my self-conceit when I compare it with my conduct, and I see observance of that law and hence its *practicability* proved before me in fact. (Kant 1997: 5:77)

What we have so far is a contrast between recognition respect for social status, honor respect, which consists in public deference regardless of anything internal (like Fontenelle's not-bowing spirit), and a form of moral respect that does consist in the spirit bowing. But what form of moral respect is this? Is it recognition or appraisal respect?

For various reasons, it seems most natural to take the kind of moral respect Kant here describes to be appraisal respect. To begin with, Kant's saying that his spirit bows, "whether I want it or whether I do not," suggests nothing like deliberate treatment but some form of involuntary response. Second, to play the role Kant gives it in his moral psychology, respect must be some form of feeling. Most telling, though, is that Kant describes a reaction to someone's "uprightness of character." This is a response we have, not from a deliberative perspective in deciding how to conduct ourselves toward someone, but from an observer's standpoint in appraising a person's (motivated) conduct or character. Kant seems to be describing a response to someone whose action does not "merely . . .fulfill the *letter* of the law," but also "contain[s] its *spirit*" (Kant 1997: 5:72).

Start with that tentative hypothesis. The feeling of respect that manifests itself, unbidden, when one contemplates good will or "uprightness of character" is moral appraisal respect. But this cannot be the end of the story, though, since to play the role respect is slated for in Kant's moral psychology, it must be something we feel, and that can motivate action, *from the deliberative standpoint*. And it must be the kind of respect that one can have for the moral law. The respect that is primarily in question in this section of the second *Critique* is "morality itself [the moral law] considered as incentive" (Kant 1997: 5:76), and this is not the form of respect that is felt from an observer's perspective in considering and evaluating someone with uprightness of character. Rather it is the kind of respect that is realized in the moral psychology of such an upright person herself as she deliberates about what to do.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

We will return to this issue presently. I want first, however, to draw attention to some features of Kant's description of the setting in which respect arises. As we noted before, Kant's example is of respect felt by someone of superior social status for a "common humble man." Even if one relates to such a person socially (from above) in a way that reinforces the latter's social inferiority, Kant's thought is that one may find respect for him and his uprightness inescapable. One's spirit may bow whether one wants it to or not. Despite seeing the person as common in the status sense of ordinary or undistinguished, and even while continuing to treat the person as (socially) inferior, one can find oneself feeling appraisal respect for him and his uprightness.

It is also relevant that the person inspiring respect is *humble*. On one meaning of "humble" ("of humble origins"), being humble just means having low rank, yielding essentially the same point we just noticed. But "humble" has another sense that contrasts with "proud." In this sense, being humble (like being proud), consists not in status, but in how one *carries oneself*. A humble person carries himself as someone of ordinary or common status, not vying for higher ranks. A proud person, by contrast, carries herself as someone to whom attention should be paid, of whom notice is to be taken.

The important point is that being humble in this latter sense involves posing no status threat to those of superior position. If one has a humble position but presents oneself as proud in the sense of vying for higher status ("puts on airs" or "acts up"), that poses a status challenge to those above. They must either refuse to recognize or defer to the proud individual's higher self-presentation (look him out of countenance) or risk closing the social distance between them, thus reducing their relative superiority. When social superiors are in the presence of inferiors who are humble in this second sense, they have no need to defend their higher status. And in such an undefended moment, they are less likely defensively to protect themselves against feelings of moral appraisal respect.

Finally, "common's" more frequent meaning, even indeed when it carries its hierarchical sense of "ordinary" or "low," refers to something that is *shared in common*. In this regard, a common man or person is *someone like oneself* in a relevant respect. This feature of respect's object is absolutely crucial for Kant's account. Kant's idea is that even social betters, regardless of their social postures, cannot escape an evaluative feeling of others *from a shared, common perspective* as one person among others in terms of *standards that apply to anyone simply as one person among others*. Any such standard must apply also to the person with the feeling herself, however high above others her social status might be, or indeed, however high an opinion she might have of herself above others (in terms of whatever other standards she might care about).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

As "uprightness" signals, Kant thinks that the relevant standards concern standards of duty, obligation, or right, the moral law itself. In undefended moments, we cannot help feeling moral esteem or appraisal respect for a person of good will whose actions embody the spirit of the moral law, that is, someone who complies with deontic standards that apply to him as one person among others just because he is so obligated.

### **4. Interlude on Self-Conceit**

Kant describes the experience of respect as a kind of humiliation. We do not simply find ourselves with unbidden moral esteem (appraisal respect) for a common humble upright person, we also feel the force of a normative standard, that moral law that "strikes down" or "humiliates" what Kant calls "self-conceit" in us. Now as I mentioned above, any respect for the moral law, as opposed to for the goodness of will, character, and conduct of someone (an upright person) who acts "from duty" and thus embodies the "spirit" of the law, must be a form of recognition rather than appraisal respect. Another way of putting the point is to say the form of respect that an upright person herself feels in acting must be recognition respect rather than appraisal respect.

This is analogous to a point that Aristotle makes in an ancient virtue-theoretical framework, whereas Kant's is in a modern deontic key. Even though Aristotle holds that the chief good for human beings is virtuous (estimable) activity, the virtuous person is herself moved to act by the sense that certain (courageous, moderate, just, etc.) *actions* are noble and good in themselves. She is moved, that is, not directly through a form of esteem for motive and character, but through her sense, from a deliberative standpoint, that a kind of action is intrinsically good.

In Kant's terms, an upright person is moved by respect for the moral law. And this must be a form of moral recognition respect that differs from the moral appraisal respect that we, contemplating her, feel for her being so moved. Nevertheless, in feeling unbidden moral appraisal respect for her we are brought face to face with a standard of conduct (the moral law) to which we are committed in esteeming her. Her "example holds before me a law that strikes down my self-conceit" (Kant 1997: 5:77). And this, Kant must be thinking, leads unavoidably from moral appraisal respect for the upright person to moral *recognition*

respect of the law, one that emulates the moral recognition respect that the upright person herself feels in being moved to comply with moral law "immediately" or "by morality itself considered as incentive."

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

But what, exactly, is self-conceit? And what is the "humiliation" it receives that Kant takes to be part of the feeling of respect? Kant distinguishes two forms of "self-regard": "self-love" and "self-conceit" (Kant 1997: 5:73). Self-love is a "predominant *benevolence* toward oneself," roughly caring more for oneself and more about one's well-being than about others'. Self-conceit, on the other hand, consists in "*satisfaction with oneself*" or "esteem for oneself " that is independent of and unconstrained by the moral law.

Self-love need only be "restricted" "to the condition of agreement with" the moral law (Kant 1997: 5:73). When thus restricted, "it is called rational self-love" (Kant 1997: 5:73). "Rational self-love" for Kant is not, however, simply instrumentally rational desire or pursuit of well-being. It is also "restricted" or constrained by the moral law. Unlike self-conceit, self-love does not pretend or purport to provide any standard for esteem or satisfaction with ourselves at all, much less one that is unconstrained by the moral law. Concern for oneself or desire for one's well-being, however strong, does not even pronounce on what would make one estimable.

By self-conceit, however, Kant means forms of self-satisfaction or self-esteem on any grounds that purport to be independent of and unconstrained by the moral law. At its most extreme, this can include forms of ego-obsession and involvement that involve seeing oneself as inherently better than or superior to others. But it also encompasses any standard of esteem that is independent of and unconstrained by the *common* moral standard of compliance with the moral law.

Internalized conceptions of social, race, and gender privilege are paradigm examples. In our passage, Kant's gentleman is able to maintain his high social standing while feeling unbidden moral esteem for a common humble man. So long as his continuing to enact his social superiority ("holding his head so high") is *just* an act, there may not yet be any self-conceit to be struck down. But suppose his "character" does not simply so act in the social drama, but that he, the individual seeking to play this role, indulges in feeling *justified* in so acting. Now we have self-conceit. He, the actual human individual, is feeling self-satisfied esteem for himself as an honorable person to whom people should defer independently of the moral law.

It is this latter, self-esteem's form in self-conceit, that cannot coexist simultaneously with his moral esteem for the common humble upright person. Esteem for uprightness just *is* esteem for being governed "immediately" by the moral law, a normative standard that is common to all persons, irrespective of their rank, status, or personae, *any such considerations to the contrary notwithstanding*. From the perspective of moral appraisal respect for uprightness, we see that "all claims to esteem for oneself that precede accord with the moral law are null and quite unwarranted" (Kant 1997: 5:73). From this standpoint, any standard for esteem deriving from social status hierarchies are unmasked as mere pretense. And even standards of genuine human excellences are seen to be limited and regulated by the moral law.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 30/03/21, SPi**

Thus, is self-conceit struck down or humiliated? Like humiliations of more familiar kinds, a "superior" person feeling moral esteem for a "lower" upright person cannot escape a felt lowering that implicitly recognizes that any standard that might rationalize his superiority is bogus (self-conceit's "illusion" [Kant 1997: 5:76]) because he cannot possibly be more estimable than an upright person who is governed by a law that binds both of them just as "common" persons. And this humiliation, according to Kant, provides a painful aspect that is essential to respect (Kant 1997: 5:73).

At the same time, in feeling respect for a common upright person's good will, Kant here says, one is esteeming her for her exercise of a capacity that is shared in common between respecter and respected. The upright person provides an "example" of action "immediately" on the moral law ("from duty") "and hence its *practicability* [is] proved before me in fact" (Kant 1997: 5:77). What Kant means by the "practicability" of the moral law cannot just be that everyone can act in accordance with it, that it never demands anything it is impossible to do. We hardly need the example of an upright person to prove that it is possible to keep our promises, tell the truth, and act in *conformity* with the moral law (as Kant says, "legally," in our external conduct). What the common upright person shows by example is that, just like the respected, the respecter, *whoever he may be*, can also act "immediately" on the law, embodying its "spirit" and not just its "letter." It demonstrates the possibility of acting not just in accord with duty, but from duty in a way that gives action "genuine moral worth" (Kant 1996: 4:398).
