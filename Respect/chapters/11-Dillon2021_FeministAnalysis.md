A Feminist Analysis

*Robin S. Dillon*

### **Introduction**

In *My Bondage and My Freedom*, Frederick Douglass describes an incident that was the "turning point" in his life as a slave: a battle with Edward Covey, "the Negro Breaker" (Douglass 1969: 205, 246). Having been sent to Covey by his master to be "broken," transformed from a defiant slave into a submissive one, Douglass endured severe floggings and arduous labor. After one especially brutal episode, Douglass reports that "a few months of this discipline tamed me . . .I was broken in body soul and spirit. . .behold a man transformed into a brute" (Douglass 1969: 291). But Douglass eventually resolved to stand up in his own defense. When Covey attempted another beating, a two-hour battle ensued, and a bloodied Covey gave up without having subdued Douglass. As a result, Douglass says,

I was a changed being after that fight. I was *nothing* before; I WAS A MAN NOW. It recalled to life my crushed self-respect and my self-confidence . . .I was no longer a servile coward. (Douglass 1969: 246–247)

But while Douglass invites his readers to see his fight as manifesting self-respect, the slavery-supporting whites of the time would have seen his refusal to submit to the legitimate, even God-given, authority of his masters as the worst form of "impudence, worthy of punishment" (Douglass 1969: 230). Douglass's actions would have been seen as the height of arrogance, not the height of self-respect.

An interesting contemporary parallel can be found in divergent characterizations of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. According to its website, BLM "is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise" (blacklivesmatter.com). The movement insists that far from holding that white lives don't matter, "the statement 'black lives matter' contains an unspoken but implied 'too,' as in 'black lives matter, too.' " The intention of the movement is thus to advocate for "dignity, justice, and respect" for all Black people "and, by extension all people." It is clear from these statements that the BLM members mean to express respect for themselves and to advance social changes that might promote respect among all persons.

However, some opponents of BLM condemn it as arrogant. For example, according to one critic,

The arrogance of the Black Lives Matter movement—a movement based on a false narrative—is being displayed across the country on neighborhood streets and interstate highways. Groups of self-righteous narcissists have taken to forming human chains to block streets, thoroughfares, and highways. . .disrupt[ing] people's daily lives. . .The arrogance of the faux movement, aside from the assassinations of five Dallas police officers, is endangering the lives of people routinely now. (angrypatriotmovement.com)

While it might seem easy to dismiss one or the other side of these two sets of divergent assessments, together they raise a number of interesting questions, including why there is divergence in the first place. There are, of course, conflicting assessments where one is correct and justified and the other is not. But something more seems to be going on in these cases. A still more interesting question arises if we take both assessments seriously, if only initially: is it possible for self-respect and arrogance genuinely to coincide? That is, is it possible for arrogance to be genuinely self-respecting, for self-respect to be genuinely arrogant?

Now, it might seem odd, if not theoretically absurd, even to contemplate this possibility. For surely they are antithetical—surely arrogance is a morally bad trait and self-respect a morally good one. Indeed, I have elsewhere developed a Kantian analysis of arrogance as a vice whose core is a violation of the fundamental moral duty of self-respect (Dillon 2003; 2007; 2015). However, if Douglass and Black Lives Matter activists can plausibly be called both arrogant and selfrespecting, then perhaps arrogance is not always a vice. Perhaps it can even be a virtue of self-respecting resistance to injustice.

I propose taking seriously the possibility that arrogance could be self-respecting for subordinated people in contexts of oppression.1 To do this, I need to revise the Kantian analysis by centering something that Kant neglects but that is pivotal to the cases above, namely power. Such a focus is essential to feminist ethics. For example, as Margaret Walker says, "feminist ethics is inevitably and fundamentally about morality and power and the moral meaning of relations of unequal power" (Walker 2001: 4). Indeed, as Susan Sherwin notes, feminist ethics asks about power, about domination and subordination, even before it asks about good and evil (Sherwin 1992). My aim in this essay is to contribute to our understanding of self-respect by using the perspective of feminist ethics to focus on connections among arrogance, self-respect, and power.

In what follows, I'll briefly sketch the Kantian analysis of arrogance and selfrespect, then identify some connections between arrogance and power and explore the relevance of self-respect to them. I'll end by arguing that whereas an unmodified Kantian account regards arrogance as always morally pernicious, a power-conscious analysis suggests that it could be morally appropriate for women and other subordinated people to cultivate a form of arrogance in their struggles against domination precisely because it is self-respecting to do so.

### **1. Arrogance and Self-Respect: A Kantian Analysis**

Let me begin with arrogance, which is widely regarded as a serious character flaw and a cause of social, economic, political, and environmental ills. Indeed, condemnation of the arrogance of governments, corporations, political and business leaders, sports figures, pop music stars, putative criminals, and others is a familiar topic. Nor is such condemnation a recent phenomenon. Arrogance is what the ancient Greeks called hubris, which they regarded as both a civic crime that threatens social order and a vice that undermines good judgment, destroys virtue, and brings ruin for self and others (Fisher 1992). Hubris was the bane of waxwinged Icarus, the real Achilles' heel of both that warrior and his rival Agamemnon, and the doom of the Persian empire. The medievals called it *superbia*, the sin of pride, and ranked it as the deadliest of the Seven Deadly Sins: deadly not only because it is the source of all other sins and wrongdoings, but also because it corrupts and destroys the very constitution that makes us what, most fundamentally, we are.2 Arrogant pride was the downfall of Milton's Lucifer and the first sin of Adam and Eve (Augustine 1996: 335); less dramatically, it is the central flaw of the principals in Austen's *Pride and Prejudice*.

Kant agrees with this assessment of arrogance, as my previous analysis explains. That analysis begins by distinguishing two kinds of arrogance, which I call "status arrogance" and "unwarranted claims arrogance." Although they comprise different complexes of cognition, attitude, desire, and disposition, as vices their common core is distorted self-valuing. Consider first status arrogance. This is exhibited by someone who thinks he is better than other people, looks down on them, and treats them contemptuously, peremptorily, or without consideration, signaling his assessment of them as less important, less worthy than his very significant self.3 The status arrogant person also not only values himself highly but also highly values having importance and status that is greater than others'.

Kant develops a view of status arrogance as involving an unjustified belief in one's superior worth (Kant 1996b: 484 [6:346]) that "demands from others a respect it denies them" (Kant 1996b: 581 [6:465]). As Kant explains, "Arrogance [*Hochmut*] (*superbia* and, as the word expresses it, the inclination to be always *on*  *top*) is a kind of *ambition* [*Ehrbegierde*] (*ambitio*) in which we demand that others think little of themselves in comparison with us. . .Arrogance is, as it were, a solicitation on the part of one seeking honor for followers, whom he thinks he is entitled to treat with contempt" (Kant 1996b: 581 [6:465]). This presumptuous "lack of modesty in one's claims to be *respected* by others" (Kant 1996b: 579 [6:462]) is "a vice opposed to the respect that every human being can lawfully claim" (Kant 1996b: 581 [6:465]).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

The respect that status arrogance denies others is what I call "moral interpersonal recognition respect," which is the respect that each person, simply as a person, is owed by every person.4 As rationally autonomous moral agents, persons are ends in themselves with the intrinsic, absolute, and incomparable worth Kant calls "dignity," and the moral status of equality. Moral interpersonal recognition respect is the practical acknowledgment of the dignity and moral status of equal persons. The Categorical Imperative makes it our fundamental duty to treat all persons with this kind of respect. Status arrogance violates the categorical duty of moral interpersonal recognition respect, for it involves treating others, and demanding that they view themselves, as beings of a lesser kind with little worth and no claim to respect as persons. The source of this denial of respect to others is, I've argued, the failure to respect oneself.

The kind of self-respect involved here is moral interpersonal recognition self-respect, which requires understanding and valuing oneself as a being with dignity and an equal person among persons who thus has an absolute right to, and the moral authority to demand, interpersonal recognition respect from all other persons. Self-respecting persons regard certain forms of attitude and treatment from others as their due as persons and other forms as degrading and beneath the dignity of persons; and, other things equal, they are not willing to be regarded or treated by others in ways that mark them as less than a person. It is this kind of self-respect that Douglass claims to have been reawakened in him and that the BLM movement founders express and mean to foster through resistance to the oppression of Blacks.

I have explained elsewhere how status arrogance involves the failure of moral interpersonal recognition self-respect (Dillon 2003; 2007; 2015). What is important for my purposes now is that the arrogant ambition to lord it over others is motivated by what contemporary psychologists call the "self-esteem motive," the powerful desire to value oneself ever more highly, especially through being highly valued by others. Self-esteem is a positive, self-approving attitude of self-valuing that is essentially comparative and interpersonally competitive, that can be grounded in morally irrelevant, even morally bad, features of oneself, and that typically derives from external sources such as how one is regarded by others.5 Self-esteem is thus quite different from moral interpersonal recognition selfrespect. Status arrogance, I've argued, sacrifices such self-respect in order to enhance self-esteem.

Consider now unwarranted claims arrogance. This is characterized chiefly by a sense of entitlement and a disposition to overreach or arrogate, i.e., to lay claim to authority, rights, knowledge, etc., without warrant (Frye 1983; Roberts and Wood 2003). Those afflicted with this kind of arrogance assume that they have the right to do whatever they want, or are cockily confident of their abilities, or take their views to be the only possible ones. However, they are not simply mistaken in their claims; their arrogance, too, is powered by the self-esteem motive.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Kant's explanation in the *Critique of Practical Reason* of how the moral law becomes an incentive, that is, how it can directly determine our choice of action independently of our inclinations, concerns unwarranted claims arrogance. There Kant contrasts self-love [*Selbstliebe*, *Eigenliebe*] with what he calls arrogance [*Hochmuth*] or self-conceit [*Eigendünkel*]: the "propensity to make oneself as having subjective determining grounds of choice into the objective determining ground of the will in general can be called *self-love*; and if self-love makes itself lawgiving and the unconditional practical principle, it can be called *self-conceit*. . . which prescribes as laws the subjective conditions of self-love" (Kant 1996a: 200 [5:74]). As Lewis White Beck puts it, arrogance is "the inclination to take one's own subjective maxims and interests as having the authority of law" (Beck 1960: 291). Self-conceit prioritizes one's self-esteem over morality, in order to make it possible to see oneself as still morally worthy despite doing whatever one wants.6 The arrogant individual thus subordinates his rationality to inclination, debasing his dignity as a rational being.

On my Kantian analysis, unwarranted claims arrogance is opposed to another kind of self-respect, which I call "moral agentic recognition self-respect." Whereas moral interpersonal recognition self-respect is the practical appreciation of oneself as a person among persons and concerns how one ought to engage with others, moral agentic recognition self-respect is proper acknowledgment and valuing of oneself as an agent and concerns how one engages with oneself. It involves, among other things, taking seriously the responsibilities of agency, especially responsibilities to honor one's dignity as a person, to govern oneself fittingly, and to make of oneself and one's life something good and worthy of oneself. An individual with moral agentic recognition self-respect values herself appropriately by committing herself to living in accord with norms that configure a life that is appropriate to her as a person; she regards certain forms of acting, thinking, desiring, and feeling as befitting her as a person and other forms as self-debasing or shameful, and expects herself to adhere to the former and avoid the latter.

For Kant, our most vital responsibility is to realize our capacity for autonomous agency by choosing to act on rational motives, including by acknowledging the absolute authority of the moral law, which is to say, the dictates of one's own rationality unimpeded by the importuning of inclination. When one acts on maxims that derive their motivating power from reason rather than inclination, one acts like the being one is, honoring the dignity one has as a rational agent. When one acts otherwise, one betrays one's dignity and fails to respect oneself as a moral agent. The unwarrantable claims arrogance with which Kant is concerned involves just this kind of failure of moral agentic recognition self-respect: no self-respecting moral agent would subordinate their rational autonomy to their desire for self-esteem.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

For Kant, both kinds of arrogance are "ordinary vices," not ones we find only in evil people: they are natural human tendencies that spring from our natural, ineliminable, and powerful desire for self-esteem and the willingness to sacrifice self-respect in unbounded pursuit of it. It is thus part of our nature as self-valuers to be always liable to arrogance.

Before turning to the power-based critique of this Kantian analysis, I need to address a complication that Kant gestures towards when he refers to "[t]he different forms of respect to be shown to others in accordance with differences in their qualities or contingent relations—differences of age, sex, birth, strength or weakness, or even rank and dignity, which depend in part on arbitrary relations" (Kant 1996b: 583 [6:468]). While the analysis above focuses on self-respect and arrogance as moral phenomenon, Kant's remark reminds us that there are also social forms of each. Moral status arrogance involves the denial of the respect owed others in virtue of their moral status as persons. But people also have social status, indeed multiple social statuses, in virtue of their social roles and places in various social hierarchies; and those with higher status can legitimately be due recognition respect that acknowledges the social status differential. Thus, children ought to respect their parents, courtroom spectators ought to respect the judge, soldiers ought to respect their commanding officers. Individuals might be deemed arrogant should they fail to accord social superiors their due social interpersonal recognition respect. Similarly, fulfilling social roles might involve embracing and meeting certain role-relative standards, and so there are social forms of agentic recognition self-respect. For example, no self-respecting scholar would plagiarize, no self-respecting mechanic would use cheap tools. Examples of social unwarranted claims arrogance include demanding a higher grade than one has earned, parking right under the "No Parking" sign, and insisting that you know what's best for someone else. Not only are the social forms of respect different from the moral forms in their grounds and implications, but the two sorts can be in tension or even conflict with one another, as when respecting a superior by obeying their commands requires acting morally wrongly and so failing in moral agentic self-respect.

Recognizing both social and moral forms of arrogance and self-respect complicates an analysis of their connections in several ways. First, the analysis ought to be responsive to the lived experiences of people like Douglass, the BLM activists, and their critics, but the fine conceptual distinctions that philosophers are quite skilled in employing often artificially differentiate things that in practice are not sharply distinguishable and are very likely not experienced as different.7 The difficulty in distinguishing social and moral forms of respect and arrogance urges caution in too quickly identifying one's observations and theories as simply moral, uninfluenced by learned social norms.8 In fact, I will argue that in our lived experience, the contested nature of claims about arrogance and self-respect is best resolved by acknowledging that, in practical terms, we ought to recognize cases of (possible) arrogance as also being cases of morally admirable (apparent) examples of self-respect.

### **2. The Role of Power**

Turning now to power—feminist theorizing commonly distinguishes two kinds: power-to and power-over.9 Power-to refers to the ability of an individual or group to do something; it is thus the capacity of effective agency. Power-over is the ability of an individual or group to control another person or group and get the latter to do what they would not otherwise do. Some forms of power-over are in themselves morally innocuous or even valuable and necessary, such as the power parents have over their young children and bosses over their subordinates. But power-over is also the ability to dominate others unjustly, whether through coercion and brute force or discrimination, marginalization, and disparagement. The relation of master to slave is one of unjust power-over, as is the relation between men and women in societies structured by gender oppression. Douglass's context is thus clearly one structured by unjust power-over. Whether this is the context for BLM activism is one of the points of disagreement between the activists and the critics.

The Kantian analysis pays scant attention to power, even though the analysis indicates that power is central to both kinds of arrogance: unwarranted claims arrogance involves power-to in the psychologically powerful importunings of self-esteem and the flexing of existential muscle in its taking-for-granted claiming of rights, authority, and so on,10 while power-over is implicated in the presumption of high status at the heart of status arrogance. But more importantly, in addition to psychological power, both kinds of arrogance also have sociopolitical power dimensions to which a full account must attend. Kant's own analysis of arrogance in his ethics neglects these dimensions because his framework for moral theorizing is both individualist and essentialist. By individualist I mean that Kant understands arrogance to be an aspect of individuals' moral characters for which the individual is solely and fully responsible; by essentialist, I mean that Kant regards the liability to arrogance to be part of our nature as self-valuers.11 Although Kant is aware of the power of the social context to influence character,12 it is central to his view that arrogant character, like character generally, is what humans make of themselves through their own free volition (as regards both character-building actions and the choice of fundamental maxim). Whether an individual respects herself or not is also for Kant a matter of the individual's exercise of her rational will and so fully the responsibility of the individual.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

However, the individualist, essentialist psychology obscures the group-based nature of the social reality within which character develops; the politics of intergroup relations in contexts of unjust power hierarchies such as gender, race, and class; the powerful and ubiquitous social norms that endorse superiority and entitlement for some groups of humans; and the effects on individual psychology and character of group identity, social context, and social norms. Arrogance is a systemic problem, not just a problem "inside" individuals; and whether and how individuals respect themselves is more than a psychological matter of willpower. A full account of both arrogance and self-respect thus has to take account of the differential psychological and characterological consequences of the differential power held by dominant and subordinated groups and the ways power relations define and delimit worth and warrant.

Let me move towards such an account by identifying some ways in which the kinds of arrogance are connected with social arrangements of domination and subordination, and ways the two kinds of self-respect might be understood in these contexts.

### One connection between arrogance and power is this: *Status arrogance and unwarranted claims arrogance are at the valuation core of ideologies of dominance*

The many forms of domination are instantiated psychologically, behaviorally, institutionally, aesthetically, epistemologically, ontologically, mythopoetically, etc. (Yancy 2004). But underlying and obscuring the forms and instantiations of domination are the ideologies that create legitimating values, norms, and epistemic frames of reference. The ideologies of domination are codes that are taken as universal, sovereign, and true; they delimit and structure, on the one hand, what is to be deemed intelligible, valuable, normal, and superior, deserving of respect and entitled to the Good Things in life, including rights, liberty, security, opportunity, and well-being, and, on the other hand, what is unintelligible, worthless, abnormal, and inferior, deserving of disregard and not entitled to Good Things.

For example, whiteness, the system of practices, ideas, and norms that secures the power-over and privilege of white people vis-à-vis people of color in white racist societies such as the United States, presumes, is rationalized by, and draws confidence and energy from an ideology of whiteness, which is unacknowledged and even invisible to whitely people in a racist society, but which they assume and unconsciously enact.13 The ideology of whiteness has as its First Principle, "White is Worthy," the First Corollary of which is "Non-White is Unworthy," the Second Corollary of which is "Whites are entitled to more and better than non-whites." The Second Principle of whiteness is "It is of the utmost importance that white distinctiveness, superiority, and entitlement be maintained." Similarly, masculinity, the structural system that secures the power and privilege of men vis-à-vis women in a sexist society, presumes an ideology of manhood that is visible, openly acknowledged, and widely celebrated, at the core of which are the assumptions that, as John Stoltenburg so powerfully expresses them, "all members of the gender class of men are entitled to obtain their sense of self by postulating the selflessness of the gender class of women, their sense of worth by asserting female worthlessness, their power by maintaining the powerlessness of women" (Stoltenberg 2004: 47). Both ideologies hold that one group of humans is superior to other groups of humans and take that superiority to be of the utmost importance, thus underwriting both inordinance in the comparative valuing of certain selves and unwarranted claims regarding the entitlements of those selves. These two ideologies, that is, encode and legitimate status arrogance and unwarranted claims arrogance for whites and men.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

By contrast, the ideology encoded in moral interpersonal recognition selfrespect stresses the fundamental equality of all persons, regardless of race, gender, and any other such feature. Moral interpersonal recognition self-respect thus acknowledges that just as I am unconditionally entitled to respect from all other persons as their equal in dignity and moral status, so am I obligated to respect all other persons as my moral equal. Moral agentic self-respect also emphasizes the equality of all persons. Moral agentic self-respect is based on a recognition of one's own basic powers of rational and moral agency, implying equal respect for other persons with those powers.14 Moral agentic self-respect then requires that one recognize one's categorical moral duty to accord all humans equal respect and hold oneself responsible to do so.

However, when we center power, we can recognize three things. First, as many theorists have pointed out, most ethical theories represent the characteristics and life situations of only some kinds of people (particularly, members of privileged racial, gender, or class groups) as both normal for humans and as normative: as how people must be, to count as fully human (Walker 2002). The result is that some moral-theoretic constructions of respect for persons and self-respect reflect the denial of the full humanity of some humans.15 Second, some social forms of self-respect explicitly deny basic equality in support of power-structured hierarchies. Third, power relations structure not only society, but also moral thinking (Lammers and Stapel 2009), so that the distinction between social and moral forms of self-respect can blur or be elided. Thus, publicly expressed standards for being a "self-respecting woman" or a "self-respecting man" often express gendered norms that reinforce gender oppression, while those for being a "self-respecting white person" can express viciously racist standards.16 The social forms, moreover, are typically expressed in exactly the same kinds of moralized terms as Kantian self-respect, and their expressers clearly expect public affirmation by right-thinking others. Within certain communities, sociomorality explicitly rejects as immoral the idea that all persons are moral equals, and some sociomoral standards for self-respect reflect this.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

### A second connection between arrogance and power is this: *Status arrogance and unwarranted claims arrogance are at the valuation core of ideologies of dominance*

Kant holds that arrogance is a natural human liability, thus echoing Pascal's view that "the self is unjust in itself, since it makes itself the center of everything; it is inconvenient to others since it would enslave them; for each self is the enemy and would like to be the tyrant of all others" (Pascal 1966: 229–230). But focusing on unjust hierarchies of power prompts the question: Who is this really talking about? In reality, arrogance is much more likely to be a liability of the socially dominant than of humans as such. Indeed, ideologies, institutions, and practices of domination construct the self-identities and self-valuing of members of dominant groups as arrogant. The arrogant, that is, are not born that way nor are they predisposed merely as valuers to become arrogant.

It is a commonplace among psychologists and social psychologists that selves and self-identity are socially constructed, products of social interaction and sociopolitical structures and forces. According to social identity theory and social categorization theory, a significant part of self-identity and self-valuing derives from membership identification with social groups, which are organized into hierarchies. In sociocultural contexts that prize comparative self-valuing, individual psychology is primed by the socially encouraged desire to continually enhance and protect self-esteem in certain ways rather than others to identify the self, where possible, with high-status, high social-worth groups (Wojciszke and Struzynska-Kujalowicz 2007). Since social psychology research indicates that membership in socially dominant groups increases the likelihood that individuals will favor social systems that perpetuate hierarchies, endorse inegalitarian beliefs, regard themselves as superior, and derogate members of lower-status groups (Kipnis 1996; Rubin and Hewstone 2004; Wilson 2005), it comes as no surprise to find that men score more highly than women on measures of entitlement and are more likely to evaluate themselves highly, engage in derogation and discrimination, ignore social constraints, and display arrogance (Hill and Fisher 2001; Maltby 2005; Wilson 2005; Hall and Livingston 2012). As Allen Johnson explains, membership in a dominant group "grants a presumption of superiority and social permission to act on the presumption without being challenged"; and "the sense of entitlement and superiority that underlies most forms of power is so deep and so entrenched that people don't have to think about it to act from it" (Johnson 2006: 33, 117). Thus, the inordinate self-valuing and sense of entitlement of status arrogance and unwarranted claims arrogance—and the obliviousness to them that is a hallmark of privilege—can become deeply rooted in the character structure of members of dominant groups (Allport 1954; Tajfel and Turner 1979; Rubin and Hewstone 1998; Cast and Burke 2002; Schmitt et al. 2003; Rubin and Hewstone 2004).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

By contrast, arrogance is less likely to characterize social subordinates. Unwarranted claims arrogance includes the disposition to disregard constraint and assumes freedom to ignore limits. But for someone whose life experience is one of ubiquitous constraints and limitations, freedom to ignore them is not something that can be assumed. Similarly, only those who can take it for granted that they have a right and the status to make claims at all could blithely claim more than they warrant. But subordinates know that they don't have those rights and status, and they know that their interests are not only less valued but may be defined as valueless altogether. Thus unwarranted claims arrogance is less likely to be one of their ordinary vices. The same is true for status arrogance. Only from some social positions is it even possible to imagine, let alone presumptively enact, a view of oneself as superior to others. For some classes of people, a view of oneself as *equal* may be the one that gets called "unwarranted," that can't be assumed but has to be struggled for.

What is more, as Michelle Moody-Adams and others argue, self-respect is socially constructed. As she explains, "the ability to have and affirm a robust sense of selfrespect is greatly influenced by social circumstances," including both the vocabulary in which people learn "to give expression to one's self-conception, and even the concepts that initially shape that self-conception," and also the dominant and enforced values that underlie social conventions for appropriate self-valuing and appropriate expression of self-valuing in attitude and activity (Moody-Adams 1995: 276–277). Further, as Diana Meyers argues, self-valuing can be compromised because people typically give more weight to social assessments of self-worth than to moral assessments, since "all too often people lack the intellectual and emotional dependence to embrace unconventional views" (Meyers 1995: 229), a claim supported by robust empirical evidence demonstrating the difficulty of sustaining any judgment without social support (Asch 1951). At the same time, the empirical evidence also indicates that even modest social support can enable individuals to sustain their judgments despite significant disagreement from others.17 Thus, in resistance subcultures, the construction of uncompromised self-respect may be possible.

### A third connection*: Arrogance supports and reinforces group-based dominance*

The arrogance of individuals is one of the psychological and characterological complexes that articulate and sustain social hierarchies. According to social dominance theory, the ideological orientation of social dominance, which involves a preference for hierarchy and the acceptance of stereotypes that express and legitimate inequality (and which men exhibit far more commonly than women) is "a psychological mechanism through which structural inequality is maintained" (Schmitt et al. 2003). Members of dominant groups have a vested interest in and strong self-esteem-based motivation to preserve both hierarchies of power, worth, and entitlement, and their own hierarchical positions. Thus, findings in social psychology indicate that men who strongly identify with masculine ideology consistently and cross-culturally show higher tendencies to hold and act on beliefs and attitudes that endorse hierarchy, dominance and entitlement for men, derogation of women, rape, other forms of sexism, and racism (Pratto et al. 2000; Hill and Fisher 2001; Wade and Brittan-Powell 2001; Wilson and Liu 2003). Of course, arrogant individuals do not behave arrogantly in every situation toward everybody else, even everybody in subordinate groups. Studies indicate that arrogance is more likely to be expressed in social contexts where identity as dominant is salient or group dominance is threatened, and aims at protection or enhancement of group-based self-esteem (Hogg and Abrams 1990; Howard 2000; Huddy 2004; Reicher 2004). Arrogant beliefs and attitudes reinforce domination; acting on them helps keep dominants and subordinates in their "proper" places and so preserves hierarchy.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Because secure moral interpersonal recognition self-respect articulates equal moral status for all, and a person with moral agentic self-respect has reason to criticize (respectfully, of course) attitudes and actions that endorse unjust hierarchy, sexism, racism, and so on, self-respect ought to foster opposition by dominants to domination. However, when distinctions between social and moral standards are blurred or unacknowledged, we could expect sociomoral standards for self-respect instead to reinforce dominance.

### A fourth connection: *Uses and non-uses of the epithet "arrogant" reflect power relations*

Whether someone is called arrogant or not, and what it means when they are, depends on the relative power location of the individuals or groups involved. For example, much of the arrogance of dominants is normalized by the ideologies of domination and hence not called arrogant or even noticed to be of a piece with the arrogance that is noticed. Indeed, the epithet "arrogant" when applied to members of dominant group seems to work the way Catherine MacKinnon argues that the term "rape," understood as "more force than usual," functions legally to legitimize injustice (MacKinnon 1989): the arrogance that social dominants do acknowledge in each other normalizes their claiming of an illegitimate share of power, rights, and authority by condemning only a subset of it. A man who is criticized as arrogant is, we might say, "more masculine than usual," nakedly expressing superiority or unwarranted entitlement claims in contexts where equality or limitation is socially salient. Uses of the epithet by dominants against other dominants functions to undercut competitors in the quest to gain comparative worth and status, and to obscure and so preserve dominance and protect the self-images of "normal" dominants from the so-called "black sheep" who threaten the exposure of the lie (Marques 1990).

However, what it means for dominants to call subordinates arrogant is different from what it means for dominants to call other dominants arrogant. I would argue that women are called arrogant relatively rarely because using the term acknowledges in its targets qualities that stereotypically characterize dominants but not subordinates, such as the exercise of power in claiming authority; the exercise of agency in acting by one's own lights; entrenched confidence in one's judgments and right to make judgments; and claims to independence and freedom from limitation and constraint. When applied to social subordinates, e.g., to women who encroach on masculine privileges or Blacks who encroach on white privilege by claiming authority, exercising agency powerfully, making judgments (especially negative judgments of dominants), and defying gender limitations and race-based constraints, the epithet "arrogant" functions to undercut legitimate claims to power or status by calling attention to their failure to be what they are supposed to be and casting the problem as defective character rather than defective social organization.

John Ridley's essay "When Rove Calls Obama Arrogant, He Means Uppity" contains an incisive critique of the epithet "arrogant" aimed at people of color and women:

We [those who are "other" in America] hear the word all the time from a select section of privileged white guys, the codifying they use when they fear the silver spoons are about to be snatched from their lily palaces: "Those people . . .how dare they think that they can work at jobs like our own or live in neighborhoods like ours or send their kids to school with ours. Those people are just so damned arrogant." Arrogant of course is a euphemism. In the monochromatic bunkers from which the old school cling to power, the word they use is "uppity" when hurled at blacks; it's the "B-word" for women. (Ridley 2008)

The function of the epithets is to put uppity folks in their place, back down where they belong.

Nor is it only words that are hurled. Priya Ramani discusses the "grave implications" for Indian women of being called arrogant, which include men throwing acid in the faces of women judged to be too arrogant, to "teach her a lesson" (Ramani 2012).

These connections between power and arrogance give us a way to assess claims that Douglass and the BLM activists are arrogant and not self-respecting. While it is difficult to know the critics' motives, it seems reasonable to suppose that the aim of their accusations is to undercut the others' claims to be self-respecting in resisting injustice, thus not only preserving the dominance of dominants but also bolstering their self-esteem and view of themselves as self-respecting folks just trying to preserve or regain what they regard as the right social order.

Of course, this assumes that we have the objective moral perspective on arrogance and self-respect, rather than the sociomoral one. But that is exactly what is being contested in some contexts. In genuinely contested cases, it seems possible to grant (at least hypothetically) the claim that perhaps the "uppity" are being arrogant, but even so, that they are showing morally justified self-respect.

### **3. Self-Respecting Arrogance**

In lived experience, which includes contested claims about arrogance, the question of whether people who are genuinely arrogant can also genuinely respect themselves can be raised. Here are four reasons to think that the answer, at least in contexts structured by power, is that they can. More specifically, examples of purported unwarranted claims arrogance can be viewed with equal legitimacy as examples of proper self-respect, within sociomoral contexts that include a (perhaps also contested) unequal power structure.

First, *sometimes arrogance can be a way to affirm self-respect in resisting power.*

In the film *Chariots of Fire* (Hudson 1981), devout Christian Eric Liddell, one of Britain's best hopes for a running medal in the 1924 Olympics, refuses to compete because his qualifying heat was scheduled for Sunday. When a member of the British Olympic committee conveys a summons from the Prince of Wales, who intends to convince him to run, Liddell initially declines to meet with him. "He is your future king," Lord Birkenhead reminds him; "are you refusing to shake his hand? Does your arrogance extend that far?" Liddell replies, "My arrogance, sir, extends just as far as my conscience demands." When the Prince argues that loyalty to his country requires making sacrifices, Liddell replies that God makes kings, countries, and rules that include keeping the Sabbath holy, and that's what he intends to do. When Lord Cadogan accuses him of impertinence, Liddell responds that the impertinence "lies with those who seek to influence a man to deny his beliefs."

There is unwarranted claims arrogance both in Liddell's setting his own judgment even above that of his future king, thereby implicitly making himself the Prince's judge and equal although sociomoral norms give the right to make judgments to his social superiors, as well as in lecturing the others on their duties. But Liddell's moral agentic self-respect is clear in his insistence on holding to his deepest principles and what his conscience demands.

Second, *arrogance on the part of social subordinates can be a way, perhaps the only way, of protesting against unjust norms and constraints, refusing their subordination, and claiming space for self-respect.*.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

When Sophocles's Antigone violates Creon's edict forbidding the burial of her brother Polyneices and then defiantly defends herself, Creon accuses her of hubris:

> This girl had then learned well how to commit hubris when she transgressed the laws that had been established; And, now that she has done it, here is a second hubris, that she exults in it, and laughs that she has done it. So, now I am not a man, she is the man, if this power will lie with her and she be unpunished.18

Now, for the Greeks, hubris works in two "directions." One is downward: hubris is an assault inflicted by people in superior positions on their social inferiors that expresses wanton and contemptuous disregard for their rights, feelings, or pride, and degrades, insults, or dishonors them (Fisher 1992).19 Downward hubris, we might say, is a way of making hierarchy hurt.20 It is motivated by the desire to enjoy superiority over others—the self-esteem motive. Creon himself is accused of downward hubris toward Antigone and the people of Thebes by his son Haemon, the seer Teiresis, and the Chorus of Elders. The other form of hubris is directed upward. Someone who saw himself as occupying a superior position would regard as hubris the presumption of those who claim familiarity or equality with him or who disobey or challenge him. Upward hubris involves audacious overreaching, aspiring beyond one's station, presuming to do more than one ought, overstepping the limits set by those with the acknowledged right to set limits—unwarranted claims arrogance (Ferguson 1958; Dickie 1984).

Creon accuses Antigone of both forms. As Creon's subject, as his niece, and as a mere woman, Antigone owes Creon unquestioning obedience. In defying his edicts and presuming to follow her own judgment, she aspires beyond the limits for "girls" and commits upward hubris. Her exultation in defiance is a further outrageous attack on his honor and insultingly claims superiority to him. Her double arrogance claims a power that assaults Creon's very identity as a man.

Interestingly, it is not uncommon in Greek tragedy for women to be accused of upwards hubris: Antigone is joined by Clytemnestra, Electra, Helen, Deianeira the "man-destroyer" in Sophocles's *Women of Trachis*, and the women who go on a sex strike and seize the Acropolis in Aristophanes's *Lysistrata*. They are all accused of hubris for wrongly aspiring or claiming to be "the Man." They transgress the bounds of propriety and usurp that to which they have no recognizable right, namely, authority, equality with men, and the right to decide their own fates or to control the lives of others.

However, although their upward hubris earned these women condemnation in their time, we could now admire it as a form of protest against being relegated to a humiliating, debased status. The mocking laughter of slaves and the claims to equality on the part of those deemed socially inferior are reasonably regarded by dominants as insolence, impudence, or uppitiness, i.e., forms of unwarranted claims arrogance. For subordinates, upward arrogance can function both as payback for the status arrogant contempt that has been rained down from above and to carve out spaces for self-respect by exposing the illegitimate claims to respect-worthiness of dominants (Miller 1995).

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

Now, whereas Kant's account regards both forms of arrogance as always morally pernicious, Antigone's arrogance is arguably not a vice because the motivation is quite different. Rather than arising from the self-esteem motive, Antigone's actions seem motivated by two other things: the desire to do what she has every reason to believe it is her familial, religious, and moral duty to do, and her recognition that both Creon's disrespectful dishonoring of her brother's corpse and his refusal to let anyone do what they have a duty to do were deeply wrong and not to be tolerated by anyone with proper regard for their responsibilities. I think it is clear that she was motivated by moral agentic recognition respect.21 Nevertheless, the sociomorality shared by Creon, Antigone's sister Ismene, and the Chorus at the beginning of the play sees in her violation of her duties of obedience an arrogant presumption and overreaching that claims what a subject and mere woman had no right to claim.22

The same can be said of Douglass. His refusal to submit to the beating that Covey had every legal and socially acknowledged right to inflict on him, and his "impudent" assault on Covey's person, are audacious overstepping of the limits set on slaves and unwarranted claims to what he had no right recognizable within the dominant sociomorality to claim. But his arrogance, too, arises not from the self-esteem motive, but from the determination to no longer endure what no human should have to endure, and from a nascent belief in his own full humanity, i.e., from the self-respect that was brought back to life through standing up for himself.

Engaging in liberatory struggle can mean adopting a stance of claiming independence from and superiority to the norms that command the submission of these people to those, of taking one's desires for freedom and for greater selfvaluation to set the standard for judging conduct and character and to be authoritative with respect to norms that pass for moral laws, of asserting different grounds for the worth of person and demanding that some people value themselves differently and less than they have been, of claiming equality with social superiors. Such a stance, which has as its ambition to destroy a whole way of life, is a form of unwarranted claims arrogance. Nevertheless, in subordinates this stance can be morally appropriate and self-respecting.

Third, *arrogance can affirm agency and be empowering in contexts of oppression and can in that way anticipate and make possible self-respect.*

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

In Toni Morrison's *Beloved*, pregnant Sethe escapes from slavery, having already sent her three children to freedom and perilously giving birth on her way to join them. As she explains years later to Paul D, "I did it. I got us all out. . .Up till then it was the only thing I ever did on my own. . .I got em out and it wasn't no accident. I did that. . .me saying *Go On* and *Now*" (Morrison 1987: 162). But when, after twenty-eight days of freedom, the master comes to reclaim his five pieces of property, Sethe takes a handsaw to her baby's neck and kills her. The "colored community" that had until then embraced her now rejects her, not only because of her "staggering" crime, but also for her pride, which "outstripped even that" (Morrison 1987: 256). At first, there was her reaction as the sheriff led her off ("Was her head a bit too high? Her back a little too straight? Probably" [Morrison 1987: 152]); later there was her self-sufficiency—she "had tried to do it all alone with her nose in the air" (Morrison 1987: 254). When Paul D learns about what she did, he realizes that "more important than what Sethe had done was what she had claimed" (Morrison 1987: 164).

Sethe develops a sense of her own value as a human only through the exercise of agency she didn't know she possessed until she exercised it in violation of every law she could know. She is absolutely certain that what she did was justified, a certainty that developed only in that moment when no other way was open to her to protect her children from enslavement as a loving and self-respecting mother had to do: she knew what would happen to them and that her job was "to keep them away from what I know is terrible" (Morrison 1987: 165)—she could not let her children be "dirtied" as she had been, dirtied "so bad you couldn't like yourself. . .so bad you forgot who you were and couldn't think it up" (Morrison 1987: 251). And she is able to survive and live a recognizably human life afterwards only through her stiff-necked pride. Her arrogance, that is, made her moral agentic self-respect possible. But Paul D believes her love was "too thick," that she "didn't know where the world stopped and she began" (Morrison 1987: 164). He and the "colored community" are confident that what she did was wrong and that no human should claim the power over life and death, nor yet be able to go on as Sethe did. Such an "outrageous" claim was staggering arrogance, which her stance of independence from the community reinforced.

In a given situation, it is possible for conflicting perspectives on self-respect and arrogance reasonably to apply and for there to be no non-question-begging way to adjudicate the disagreement. There may be no common values; or if there is agreement about, e.g., what arrogance is, how to apply that understanding can depend on other substantive but irreconcilable claims. And the judged or the judgers may have no way of knowing whether any of the conceptual schemes in play are justified, so the disagreement can be about which conceptual scheme should nevertheless prevail. Nor do we "observer"-theorists have a privileged position here.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

To put it another way, moral concepts get their thick meanings within particular moral and socio-cultural outlooks, and the judgments that employ these concepts are always socio-culturally located. Thus, while unwarranted claims arrogance *is* unwarranted claiming of status, worth, entitlements, etc., and selfrespect *is* proper acknowledgment and valuing of one's fundamental moral worth and status and one's agency, the thick content of these general concepts—what counts as warranted and unwarranted, who counts as having what status and worth, what counts as proper acknowledgment and valuing, what the legitimate scope of whose agency is—is determinable only from within a particular outlook. And different outlooks can be incommensurable. From within the kind of ethical outlook that prevails in societies deeply structured by domination and subordination and that defines some groups of people as inherently inferior and denies the moral legitimacy of their claims, their repudiation of subordination through their assumption of dignity and full moral status, their claim of equality with dominants, their insistence that their desire for freedom sets the standard for moral evaluation of persons, acts, and social arrangements, and their presumption of a right to determine for themselves how they will live, properly count as making unwarranted entitlement claims, as arrogant rejection of constraints and limits that are not only socially predominant but are regarded from within that outlook as morally binding. Of course, from an ethical outlook that regards all humans as equal in dignity and moral status, these claims are fully warranted. But such an outlook might not be available to subordinates, as it was not to Sethe or Antigone. From the socially embedded perspective of those making such claims, the warrant for them is no more secure than the warrant for the claims against which they struggle. Indeed, the objectivity of warrant for the competing claims can be precisely what the struggle is about. An outlook from which their claims are warranted might become possible for subordinates only through their struggles against domination. Unless such an outlook prevails, subordinates and those who judge them may have no option but to see what they do and are as arrogant. But what they do and are can, nevertheless, be self-respecting.

Fourth and finally, *people in subordinated positions in unjust power hierarchies could adopt arrogant stances strategically, in order to humble arrogant dominants or shock them into reflective reconsideration that makes them aware of their arrogance and privilege*.

Strategic arrogance might pave the way for more egalitarian social relations. Indeed, rebellions against various forms of tyranny might be said to be arrogant in just this way. When arrogance is employed strategically in the service of realizing the dignity of all persons and the right of each to freedom and self-determination, it is a self-respecting strategy.

There is, of course, danger. While the arrogance of moral subordinates may be morally defensible as a means to survival or as expressing or making possible self-respect, there can be moral costs to fighting fire with fire. Not only might arrogance worsen the sociopolitical environment, it might also worsen one's character: self-respecting arrogance could become just plain arrogance.

**OUP CORRECTED AUTOPAGE PROOFS – FINAL, 31/03/21, SPi**

To conclude: Despite the risk with strategic arrogance, there are good reasons to think that unwarranted claims arrogance can, in contexts of oppression, be a virtue of unsubordinating self-respect for oppressed people. More generally, there is good reason to believe that we cannot perceive accurately the arrogance in people's characters or in the world, nor come to an all-things-considered evaluation, moral and political, of arrogance, nor determine what virtues are the proper ones to inculcate and cultivate in order to prevent or eradicate bad arrogance, nor even know what genuinely self-respect requires and allows, until we attend to power.

### **Notes**

- 1. I will not argue here that it is a virtue, for that requires defending criteria for virtue and vice that differ from standard criteria. I have indicated how such a defense might go in Dillon (2012).
- 2. The two clearest expressions of this view are in Gregory the Great (2014), and Thomas Aquinas (1948), *Summa Theologica* I-II: 84. I follow Gabriele Taylor (1994) in treating the deadliness of the Deadly Sins as constitutional corruption.
- 3. My analysis draws from Tiberius and Walker's (1998) analysis of arrogance as essentially interpersonal, though it differs from theirs in a number of ways. See also Taylor (1985).
- 4. I borrow the term "recognition respect" from Darwall (1977).
- 5. Dillon (2013). I use the term "self-esteem" here as contemporary American psychologists and social psychologists use it (see, e.g., Coopersmith 1967; Baumeister 1994; Owens et al. 2001; Mruk 2006). Although self-esteem can be positive, negative, or neutral, the unmodified term usually refers to positive self-esteem. Most researchers accept it as an axiom that the desire to maintain and enhance self-esteem is an enormously powerful, ubiquitous, even universal motivation (albeit one whose operation is shaped by social and cultural context); some consider self-esteem to be the master motive in personal and interpersonal relations.
- 6. Kant sees unwarrantable claims arrogance about one's moral worth as a serious problem, to judge from the frequency of his condemnations of it (see, e.g., Kant 1996b: 562 [6:441]; Kant 1997: 130 [27:351], 135 [27:357], 211 [27:458], 216 [27:464], 364 [27:621–623]; Kant 1996c: 91 [6:46]).
- 7. See Calhoun's (2016) discussion of problems involved in trying to distinguish social norms from "genuine" moral norms.
- 8. For very many, if not most, people, social norms often have the status and power that philosophers think only objective moral norms have. For many of us, what I call "sociomorality" just is morality. It is worth noting that some feminist theorists criticize as artificial even the distinction between "objective morality" and "sociomorality" (see, e.g., Walker 2007).
- 9. For a useful discussion, see Oksala (2017). Oksala notes that power is a contested concept and identifies further distinctions; but these two forms are sufficient for my purposes.

- 10. Indeed, it is the power in unwarranted claims arrogance that explains why, despite the long tradition of using the epithet "arrogant" to strongly condemn someone else's behavior and character, it is not uncommon for people to admire arrogance, maintaining that it makes someone a better leader or more successful competitor.
- 11. See Kant's discussion of the manias for honor and domination in the *Anthropology* and of the predisposition to humanity in the *Religion*. About the latter, Kant says that out of the innate predisposition to self-love "originates the inclination to *gain worth in the opinion of others*, originally, of course, [!] merely *equal worth*: not allowing anyone superiority over oneself, bound up with the constant anxiety that others might be striving for ascendancy; but from this arises gradually an unjust desire to acquire superiority for oneself over others" (Kant, 1996c: 75 [6:27]). Of course, did the individual not already desire himself to gain ascendancy over others, it would never occur to him that others might want to subordinate him—the idea that the inclination for equal worth is both natural and primary makes no sense on Kant's own account.
- 12. This is an important theme in the *Anthropology* (Kant 2007).
- 13. I use "whitely" here as Marilyn Frye does, to refer to a socially constructed, trained, "deeply engrained way of being in the world" that "could be manifested by persons who are *not* 'white'" but could be "absent in people who *are*" (Frye 1992).
- 14. I have argued elsewhere (Dillon 1992) that the logic of respect entails the willingness to universalize the judgments of respect-worthiness and the expectation that ("right-thinking") others will affirm one's judgment.
- 15. Kant's theory has, of course, been criticized as privileging a view of persons as rational and autonomous that does not reflect the lived reality of many human beings (see, e.g., Mills 2005).
- 16. One example (of far too many) is a passage said to be from a letter H. P. Lovecraft sent to Frank Belknap Long, in which he is quoted on a blog by "Graham Warnken" (2016) as writing, "how in Heaven's name sensitive and self-respecting white men can continue to live in the stew of Asiatic filth which the region has become . . .is absolutely beyond me." [[https://grahamwarnkenblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/the-crude-human](https://grahamwarnkenblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/the-�crude-�human-�animal-�h-�p-�lovecraft-�and-�the-�descent)[animal-h-p-lovecraft-and-the-descent/\].](https://grahamwarnkenblog.wordpress.com/2016/08/05/the-�crude-�human-�animal-�h-�p-�lovecraft-�and-�the-�descent)
- 17. See, e.g., Asch (1956). James C. Scott discusses the importance of "dissident subcultures" for enabling subordinated people to resist domination and maintain their self-worth in Scott (1990).
- 18. Sophocles, *Antigone*: lines 378–385 (Fisher 1992: 308).
- 19. Interestingly, in addition to laws in Athens that prohibited battery, murder, rape and so on, the Athenians also had a law, the *graphe hybreos*, which explicitly forbid hubristic acts and provided severe penalties for its violation. By making "adding insult to injury" a distinct crime, the Athenians clearly indicated, as Fisher says, "the community's disapproval of behavior that combined a disdain for persons, honor and civic identity of others with a general contempt for social, moral, and religious values that were deeply held in the community" (Fisher 1992: 81).
- 20. The anger and desire for revenge that downward hubristic assaults engender is one of the reasons why hubris was regarded as so dangerous to the stability and cohesion of the community (Ober 1989: 208–212).

- 21. I realize it may be anachronistic to make this claim. Part of my point is that it is difficult to see any objective moral standpoint, from within a sociomoral context.
- 22. Ismene accuses Antigone of "acting in excess," of "lusting for what is beyond your means," and reminds her that as women they must not oppose men.
