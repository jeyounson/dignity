# PROPORTIONALITY

 Having identified proportionality as the main tool for limiting constitutional rights, Aharon Barak explores its four components (proper purpose, rational connection, necessity, and proportionality stricto sensu ) and discusses the relationships between proportionality and reasonableness and between courts and legislation. He goes on to analyze the concept of deference and to consider the main arguments against the use of proportionality (incommensurability and irrationality). Alternatives to proportionality are compared and future developments of proportionality are suggested.

aharon barak is a faculty member at the Interdisciplinary Center (IDC) Herzliya, Israel, and a visiting professor at Yale Law School. In 1975 he was appointed Attorney General of the State of Israel, becoming Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel in 1978 and serving as President from 1995 until his retirement in 2006. He has also served as a lecturer, professor and Dean of the Law School at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

### Cambridge Studies in Constitutional Law

T e aim of this series is to produce leading monographs in constitutional law. All areas of constitutional law and public law fall within the ambit of the series, including human rights and civil liberties law, administrative law, as well as constitutional theory and the history of constitutional law. A wide variety of scholarly approaches is encouraged, with the governing criterion being simply that the work is of interest to an international audience. T us, works concerned with only one jurisdiction will be included in the series as appropriate, while, at the same time, the series will include works which are explicitly comparative or theoretical – or both. T e series editors likewise welcome proposals that work at the intersection of constitutional and international law, or that seek to bridge the gaps between civil law systems, the US, and the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth.

T is book ref ects the constitutional theory developed following the Second World War. It ref ects an expansion of the concept of constitutional law, 1 a blurring of the lines between constitutional and private law 2 as well as the development of purposive interpretation. 3 T is modern constitutional theory also recognizes positive constitutional rights alongside the negative ones, 4 and stipulates a wider judicial review on the law's constitutionality. 5 It is based on the fundamental distinction between recognizing the scope of the constitutional rights and their limitations. 6 Two key elements in developing this modern constitutional theory are the

notions of democracy and the rule of law. T e concept of proportionality stems from these two notions. T is book seeks to analyze that concept.

 Proportionality has dif erent meanings in various contexts. T is book focuses on one meaning in particular – the proportionality of a limitation applied within a democratic system, on a constitutional right by a law (a statute or the common law). For that, we must assume the very existence of such constitutional rights 7 and their legal origin (either explicitly or implicitly) in a constitutional text. T e book examines the situations in which a law may limit such a right in a constitutionally recognized manner. T e limitations that may be imposed on a constitutional right will be analyzed, as well as the limits of these limitations.

T is is an analytical essay on the limitations of constitutional rights in a constitutional democracy. 8 T e discussion must therefore include the

well-entrenched notion of democracy itself, 9 as well as of the rule of law. 10 Both are central to the understanding of constitutional limitations. Both are given a broad interpretation in these pages. T e two are well connected in that the rule of law entails the law of rules and the rule of values underlying fundamental democratic ideals (such as the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary). At the heart of these values we f nd constitutional rights, and their limitations. And at the heart of these limitations we f nd the concept of proportionality. A limitation on a constitutional right by law (statutory or common law) will be constitutionally permissible if, and only if, it is proportional. T e constitutionality of the limitation, in other words, is determined by its proportionality.

 Proportionality, therefore, can be def ned as the set of rules determining the necessary and suf cient conditions for a limitation of a constitutionally protected right by a law to be constitutionally permissible. According to the four sub- components of proportionality, a limitation of a constitutional right will be constitutionally permissible if (i) it is designated for a proper purpose; 11 (ii) the measures undertaken to ef ectuate such a limitation are rationally connected to the fulf llment of that purpose; 12 (iii) the measures undertaken are necessary in that there are no alternative measures that may similarly achieve that same purpose with a lesser degree of limitation; 13 and f nally (iv) there needs to be a proper relation ("proportionality stricto sensu " or "balancing") between the importance of achieving the proper purpose and the social importance of preventing the limitation on the constitutional right. 14

 Certain aspects of proportionality arise in circumstances that do not limit a constitutional right by statute. One of those aspects is the use of proportionality in interpretation. T e interpreter of en f nds himself with a need to determine the scope of the governmental authority. T is is true, for example, when the interpreter needs to determine the scope of a government minister's authority to provide or refuse a license as provided in a law. Regarding the question of authority, the interpreter must interpret the law's language along with its purpose. In determining the purpose, the interpreter should balance professional freedom with the public interest, which makes up the law's foundation and its purpose at a high level of abstraction. T is balancing is carried out by interpretive analogy from

the proportionality stricto sensu element. T is is interpretive balancing. 15 It dif ers from the all-encompassing proportionality which is discussed in this book. It is limited to only one of proportionality's elements – stricto sensu (balance). It deals with the interpretation (meaning) of the law and not with its constitutionality (validity).

T e set of rules that make up proportionality are a legal construct which ref ect a constitutional methodology justifying limitations on constitutional rights. 16 Proportionality's nature does not suggest a neutral approach towards constitutional rights. T e concept of proportionality is not indif erent to the limitations of rights. On the contrary, it is based on the need to protect them. Indeed, the limitations that proportionality imposes on the realization of constitutional rights, as well as the rights themselves, draw their authority and content from the same source. 17 T us, proportionality determines the proper level of protection for constitutional rights in a constitutionally rights-based democratic society. Proportionality emphasizes the importance of reason and justifying limitations on constitutional rights. 18

T is book is the product of both legal thought and legal practice. It ref ects my considered views about proportionality over the years, including the comparative study of the subject. It also ref ects the experience of judging. For twenty-eight years I served as a Justice on Israel's Supreme Court – f rst as an Associate Justice, then as a Vice-President, and f nally as the Supreme Court President. Even before fully understanding the concept of proportionality, I ruled in accordance with its precepts. However, in the last fourteen years of my judicial career, I wrote dozens of Supreme Court opinions explicitly applying the concept of proportionality, as did my colleagues on the bench. T is book is based on this judicial experience.

 Although my judicial experience is limited to Israel's legal system, this book is not so narrow. On the contrary, it attempts to provide a universal understanding of the concept of proportionality in constitutional democracies. It ref ects the law of many legal systems where proportionality is frequently applied. I am hopeful that countries with constitutional rights will be able to make use of this book in understanding their own approach towards proportionality. T e same should apply to other legal systems – such as those of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and

Victoria, Australia – where human rights are not on a constitutional level, but the courts are still authorized to determine whether their limitation is proportional. Although such a determination does not render the law unconstitutional, it fully applies the rules of proportionality as analyzed in these pages. 19

T e goal of this book is not to describe the legal reality surrounding proportionality in various countries' constitutional law. T e intention is not to compare the use of proportionality in dif erent legal systems. Rather, the goal of this book is to present an analytical model of the legal institution dubbed proportionality. T e appeal to comparative law is meant to substantiate the model presented herein. It is meant to show that this is not only a theoretical model disconnected from reality. It aims to convince that this theoretical model is accepted in comparative law, which draws from it and inf uences its development.

 Every study of proportionality must recognize Alexy's inf uence. 20 His contribution to the understanding of the rules of proportionality and their development is very signif cant. T is is particularly the case in civil law legal systems; but now also true in common law systems thanks to the excellent translation by Professor Julian Rivers of Alexy's book which deals with, amongst other matters, proportionality, 21 as well as Rivers' comprehensive introduction to that book. 22 While Alexy's inf uence is clear on many of this book's pages, the opinion herein diverges from him on some of the key issues relating to proportionality.

mention a number of these departures: First, Alexy is of the opinion that, when two constitutional rights shaped as principles are in conf ict, or when a constitutional right is in conf ict with the public interest, a special constitutional rule is formed that operates on the constitutional sphere and reduces the scope of the constitutional right. 23 In my opinion, such a rule operates only on the sub-constitutional level (statutory or common law), and does not af ect the scope of the constitutional right itself. Second, the balancing rule, according to Alexy, compares the importance of the purpose that the limiting law seeks to obtain to the harm (light, moderate, or serious) inf icted upon the constitutional right. Although we agree that the f rst part of the balancing equation should include the importance of the proper purpose, this should be balanced against the importance of preventing the limitation of the constitutional right. To me, constitutional rights are not of equal importance. T e importance of the right in tipping the scale is determined not solely on the extent of the constitutional right's limitation, but rather according to the importance of preventing the harm caused by the limitation. T ird, according to Alexy's proportionality concept, the same rule applies in protecting constitutional rights as it does in the protection of public interest. 24 My approach draws a distinction between these two notions. Fourth, according to Alexy, the application of proportionality considerations is preconditioned upon the right being shaped as a constitutional principle . 25 T is is not my approach. T us, proportionality considerations may apply even where the right is shaped as a constitutional rule. T e legal source from which proportionality derives is not related to the way the right is phrased (as a rule or principle), but rather to considerations of democracy and the rule of law af ecting the text's legal interpretation.

 With the "migration" or "transplantation" of proportionality in constitutional law from its birthplace in Germany to many of the world's legal systems, the legal literature on the subject abounds. Many important books and essays are dedicated to it. 26T is raises the obvious question – is

Van der Schyf , Limitation of Rights: A Study of the European Convention and the South African Bill of Rights (Nijmegen, T e Netherlands: Wolf Legal Publishers, 2005);

there a need for another book on proportionality? How is this book any dif erent from the many that have preceded it? T e answer is that this book is unique in the following four characteristics: First, it does not follow the pattern of analyzing proportionality in one legal system and then comparing it to another; rather, it creates a comprehensive analytical framework of the concept of constitutional proportionality, and it does so against a comparative background. T us, the book contains a discussion of proportionality in constitutional law in general, while providing several examples from dif erent legal systems in each sub-topic discussed.

 Second, a fundamental part of the book's approach is the perception that the most central component of the proportionality analysis is proportionality stricto sensu or balancing. 27T is is the component that draws most of the criticism on the concept as a whole. T e book attempts to respond to this criticism, while redesigning the balancing tests. For that reason, it places – on both sides of the scale – the term social importance. 28 T is term focuses on the marginal social importance of achieving the law's proper purpose on the one hand, and the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the right itself on the other. In addition, in discussing the limitations on rights, the book distinguishes between more and less important rights; as aforementioned not all rights were created equal. It is against this background that the suggestion is made to redef ne the rules of balancing by adding – in between the basic balancing rule and ad hoc balancing – a principled balancing rule.

T ird, this book emphasizes the methodological aspect of proportionality. To that end, it highlights the distinction between the f rst stage of the analysis, where the scope of the constitutional right is determined, and the second stage, where the justif cations to limit the right are considered. It also notes the distinction between the constitutional nature of the right and the sub-constitutional nature of the limitation of that right. It develops an approach to special instances whereby two constitutional rights conf ict. T at approach is based on the notion that such a conf ict

will usually af ect only the statutory or common law level; it will not, however, af ect the scope of the conf icting constitutional rights. T e book also draws a distinction between balancing as one of the components of proportionality (which is relevant to the examination of the constitutionality of laws which limit a constitutional right), and interpretative balancing (which is relevant for the examination of the interpretation of a law whose purpose includes conf icting principles). 29 It emphasizes the role of the public interest and the protection of the constitutional right in the framework of the balancing component and rejects the view that it can determine the scope of the constitutional rights. It distinguishes between a limitation of a constitutional right by statute and the common law.

 Finally, the book examines several alternatives to proportionality, and analyzes the pros and cons of each. 30 According to the book's approach, proportionality suf ers from many shortcomings; still, none of the alternatives is better – or even as good as – proportionality itself. Having said that, there are elements of proportionality that should be ref ned and improved. T e book examines and develops some key ideas to do so. Should these improvements be implemented, they would not af ect the uniqueness of the concept. However, they may bring the concept of proportionality closer to the approach practiced in the United States.

 Any review of the proportionality of a law which limits a constitutional right is based on a three-stage inquiry. In the f rst stage, one should examine the scope of the protected right. T is stage deals with the boundaries of the constitutional right. In the second stage, the question is whether there is a justif cation to limit the right – i.e., whether the constitutional right's limitation is proportional. It examines the extent of the rights protection. T is examination deals with the application of the four components of proportionality. T e third stage – which does not deal directly with proportionality – occupies itself with the remedy, should the court decide that one of the components failed. It thus deals with the consequences of the unconstitutionality of a disproportional limitation on a constitutional right. T is book is mostly occupied with the second stage (the proportionality of a limiting law). It does not examine the third stage (remedy). It does review the central tenets of the f rst stage (the right's scope), which are conditions for the application of the rules of proportionality. Accordingly, the book proceeds as follows:

T e f rst part of the book reviews the scope of the constitutional rights (the f rst stage). T e f rst chapter deals with the basic distinction in modern

29 See below, at 72. 30 See below, at 493.

constitutional theory between the scope of the constitutional right 31 and the justif cation for its limitation. 32 From this basic distinction, the notions of "relative rights" and "absolute rights" may also be drawn. T e chapter analyzes these notions and emphasizes that most constitutional rights are relative – rather than absolute – in nature. T at relativity entails that limitations may exist on their legal realization. T e chapter analyzes the characteristics of these limitations and concludes with the examination of the question of whether a relative constitutional right is a prima facie right or a def nite right. T e second chapter reviews the parameters for determining the scope of the constitutional right. T ese parameters are interpretive in nature. 33 T e chapter brief y discusses constitutional purposive interpretation, while emphasizing both the importance of the constitutional text (either explicit or implicit) and the constitutional purpose. T e discussion stresses the importance of a comprehensive comparative perspective to these questions. T e approach here is that a constitutional right should be examined through a "wide lens," and that its scope should not be restricted due to considerations of either public interest or the constitutional rights of others. Both the public interest and the constitutional rights of others should be considered, but only in the next stage of the inquiry – that considering justif cations for possible limitations on the right itself. T e third chapter examines situations where one constitutional right conf icts with another. According to this approach, the solution to such a conf ict is not on the constitutional level (the rights' scope is not af ected by the conf ict); rather, the solution is in the subconstitutional realm (that is, the constitutionality of the law limiting one constitutional right in order to protect the other may be af ected). 34 T e fourth chapter examines the conditions to determine that a law (statutory or common law) has in fact limited a constitutional right. Here, I review the distinction between limitations placed on a constitutional right and the amendment of a constitutional right. 35 T e book's f rst part ends with the ff h chapter, which analyzes the principle of legality according to which a limitation on a constitutional right must be carried out by a law whose authority can be traced back to the constitution itself (the "authority chain"). T e chapter then reviews the special issues which arise out of a common law limitation upon a constitutional right. 36

T e second part of the book examines more closely the nature, role, function, and origins of proportionality. T e sixth chapter def nes

31 See below, at 19. 32 See below, at 20. 33 See below, at 45. 34 See below, at 87. 35 See below, at 99. 36 See below, at 118.

proportionality and reviews several methods for the limitation of constitutional rights. 37 It examines situations where the constitution is silent about such limitations and where it explicitly acknowledges that rights can be limited by a law – but without saying anything else about the nature of such a law or the conditions it should meet. T e conclusion is that in both situations such a law must be proportional. T e chapter emphasizes the close connection between the constitutional right and its limitations. It highlights the importance of proportionality as the proper rule for evaluating both the justif cation for limitations on a constitutional right and the protection of constitutional rights. T e chapter ends with an analysis of the "override" clause, which appears in several constitutional texts, and its relationship with proportionality. T e seventh chapter reviews the historical origins of proportionality. 38 It follows the concept's migration (or transplantation) – from its beginnings in Germany to Continental Europe and then on to the rest of the world. T e eighth chapter examines the legal sources of proportionality 39 and specif cally reviews four of them, namely: democracy, the rule of law, the shaping of a constitutional right as a principle, and constitutional interpretation. Af er analyzing each of these sources, my conclusion is that each may independently suf ce to provide legitimacy to the concept of proportionality – but none is able to provide actual content to proportionality itself.

T e third part is the book's main part: It examines each of the components of proportionality. T e ninth chapter examines the " proper purpose" component. 40 It examines its nature, legal sources, and content. T e chapter dif erentiates between a purpose relating to the protection of the constitutional rights of others and one relating to the protection of the public interest, such as the continued existence of the state and its existence as a democracy, national security interests, public order, justice, tolerance, sensitivity to the feelings of others, and the promotion of objective constitutional values that ref ect the subjective constitutional rights. T e chapter then examines the degree of urgency regarding proper purposes and the ways to prove such in court. T e tenth chapter examines the " rational connection" component. 41 T e chapter concludes with an assessment of the importance of this component. T e eleventh chapter examines the " necessity" component. Here, the book reviews the nature of this requirement, its elements and importance. 42 A considerable part of the discussion is dedicated to the question of "overbreadth" coverage and

37 See below, at 133. 38 See below, at 175. 39 See below, at 211. 40 See below, at 245. 41 See below, at 303. 42 See below, at 317.

to situations where it is impossible to achieve the proper purpose without the use of overly broad means. T e twelf h chapter examines the " proportionality stricto sensu " component. 43 T is is the central component of proportionality. T e book reviews the content of this component and the fact that it is based on balancing. Most of the chapter is dedicated to the nature of that balancing. It stresses that the required balance is between the marginal social importance of the benef t in fulf lling the law's proper purpose, and the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right. T is therefore concerns the relative notion of social importance found on each side of the scale. In this regard, the book emphasizes the marginal nature of the examination of the competing social priorities. T e question, therefore, is not, for example, how to compare the importance of national security to the importance of the sanctity of life; rather, what is the social importance in the marginal contribution to national security (as a result of such law) as compared with the social importance of the marginal harm caused to the constitutional right to life because of it. In considering the marginal social importance of fulf lling the proper purpose, one has to consider how urgent it is to obtain such a goal, as well as the probability of obtaining such a goal by other means. In determining the marginal social importance in preventing harm to the constitutional right one must consider the nature of the right, its place in the rights hierarchy, the degree of the intended limitation, and the probability of the occurrence of such a limitation. In that respect, the book suggests that not all rights are created equal in importance. Accordingly, it devised – based on Alexy – the following basic balancing rule: T e more important it is to prevent marginal harm on the constitutional right, and the higher the probability such harm will occur, then the marginal benef t to the public interest (or to the protection of other persons' rights) required to justify such limits should be more socially important, more urgent, and more probable. Based on this basic rule of balancing, one can carry out ad hoc balancing in concrete cases, according to their specif c facts. T is chapter concludes with a review of the case of the "balanced scales." T is occurs whenever both sides of the balance are of equal marginal social importance. In these cases, the social value in preventing harm to the constitutional right should prevail. T e thirteenth chapter is dedicated to the examination of the relationship between proportionality and reasonableness. 44 At the outset it is noted that much of the examination depends on how one def nes reasonableness. To the extent

43 See below, at 340. 44 See below, at 371.

that reasonableness is def ned in terms of balancing between competing values, there is little distinction between reasonableness and proportionality. Chapter fourteen examines the role of the legislator, as well as that of the judge, regarding proportionality. 45 It is emphasized that every branch of government should respect the rules of proportionality. Each branch has its own role to f ll, and its own discretion to exercise, within the rules of proportionality. T us, for example, the constitutional role of the judiciary is to ensure that other branches of government abide by the applicable rules of proportionality. T e constitutional roles of the legislator are many, and include a preliminary discretion whether to legislate at all; discretion as to the purposes it wishes to promote through that legislation, and discretion relating to the means that are required to obtain such purposes. Importantly, all these discretionary acts should abide by the rules of proportionality. To the extent that the legislator operates within the proportional realm of discretion – as long as it operates within the "proportionality zone" – there is no place for the judiciary to replace legislative discretion by judicial discretion. T is result does not mean that the judiciary defers to the legislator; rather, it means that the judiciary recognizes the constitutionality of the legislator's actions while operating within its discretional boundaries. T e chapter expands on this point, while examining the notion of deference. T e chapter concludes with an assessment of the "margin of appreciation." T e relevance of this term should be reduced and should only be used by international tribunals. It should play no role in national courts. Chapter ff een is dedicated to positive rights and legislative omissions. It examines the role of proportionality when a positive constitutional right (like the duty to protect human dignity) is af ected by legislative omission. 46 T e chapter begins with an analysis of the notion of a "positive right," its origins, nature, and likely consequences. With this in mind, it examines the application of the rules of proportionality when a positive right is af ected by an omission of the legislator. T e conclusion is that there is nothing unique about the notion of a positive constitutional right in relation to a proportionality analysis. T us, the application of proportionality to a legislative omission is identical to its application to a legislative action in the case of a negative constitutional right (like the duty not to af ect human dignity). T e sixteenth and last chapter of the third part is dedicated to the issue of the burden of proof. 47 T e burden of proof (which includes both the burden of persuasion and the evidentiary burden) lies with the party arguing that

45 See below, at 379. 46 See below, at 429. 47 See below, at 435.

a limitation has been placed on the constitutional right in the f rst stage of the constitutional examination ("Is there a limitation upon a constitutional right?"). In the second stage of the constitutional examination ("Is the limitation proportional?"), the burden lies with the party arguing that there is a justif cation for the limitation, i.e., that such a limitation is proportional. T e uniqueness of the judicial process in public law is considered, as are the implications of such uniqueness on issues regarding the burden of proof.

T e fourth part is dedicated to the assessment of the concept of proportionality. T e seventeenth chapter examines the various arguments supporting proportionality. 48 It focuses on a number of principal arguments emphasizing the need for justif cation, structured discretion and its transparency, as well as the assistance proportionality provides in creating dialogue between the legislator and the judge. T e chapter examines the connection between proportionality and constitutional rights theories. T e argument developed is that proportionality, as an analytical structure, f ts in well with most of the modern approaches to constitutional rights. T e chapter concludes with an examination of the connection between proportionality, democracy, and judicial review of legislation. It is stressed that the concept of proportionality of ers an important justif cation for judicial review in that it enforces constitutional legitimacy by opening the courts' doors for argument of good reasons which justify the limitation of rights. It also contributes to judicial objectivity.

T e eighteenth chapter examines the main arguments against the use of proportionality (primarily, balancing) and their possible answers. 49 It examines the critique on proportionality from the standpoints of incommensurability and the lack of rationality ("internal" critiques). It is argued that the premise of both concepts is wrong, since the common ground for the balancing test is well founded and well recognized – the marginal social importance of the benef t in fulf lling the proper purpose as compared with the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right. In particular, the notion that proportionality's balancing act is "irrational" because it contains several elements of discretion is rejected. Alongside the "internal" critique, the "external" ones are considered. T e arguments – that proportionality (mainly the balancing) provides the judge with too wide a discretion, that it does not grant suf cient protection to constitutional rights, and that it lacks legitimacy – are addressed and countered.

48 See below, at 457. 49 See below, at 481.

T e nineteenth chapter considers proportionality's alternatives. 50 T ese alternatives include considering the rights as absolute while their scope is determined by the legislator; 51 an absolute protection of all rights within the constitutional core; 52 and the dualistic model. 53 Most of the chapter is dedicated to the assessment of the classif cation of constitutional rights practiced in the United States. 54 T us, the American approach is analyzed and compared to the concept of proportionality. Most of the comparison focuses on the " strict scrutiny" review as exercised by the United States Supreme Court, and the conclusion that arises is that this is a dif cult comparison due to the ambiguity in the strict scrutiny examination. T is ambiguity exists mainly in relation to overinclusiveness coverage, particularly in situations where it is impossible to narrowly tailor the means by which the legislator can achieve the governmental interest. In that respect, an of er is made to reexamine the Korematsu case, 55 assuming that there exists an evidentiary basis regarding the claim that a large percentage (e.g., 10 percent or more) of American citizens of Japanese descent actually assisted the Japanese enemy in times of war. If, under these assumptions, it would be held – under the "strict scrutiny" test – that the law in question is constitutional, then it is clear that the concept of proportionality is more protective of human rights than the American doctrine, as it would still require the judges to examine the law through the eyes of the fourth component – proportionality stricto sensu – and to conduct the balancing accordingly. T e result of this examination may be that the limitation of constitutional rights is not properly balanced and thus unconstitutional. Conversely, if, under these assumptions, it would be held – through the "strict scrutiny" test – that the law in question is unconstitutional, then it is clear that the concept of proportionality is less protective of constitutional rights, as it would perhaps still f nd the law to be constitutional under the balancing component. At the end of this chapter, a reexamination of the arguments against proportionality are carried out and the question to what extent – if any – they apply to the American categorization is asked. Despite all this, the conclusion is that, in the face of the many criticisms of proportionality – some of them justif ed – a better alternative has not been found yet.

T e twentieth and last chapter in this part proposes several ideas for the future development of the concept of proportionality. 56 In relation to the " proper purpose" component, the need to provide limiting criteria for such a purpose is noted, as the German approach, which is satisf ed by the fact that such a purpose is not contrary to the constitution itself, is insuf cient. T e suggestion to distinguish regarding the proper purpose, between those rights that rank higher in importance, and other rights, is made. When dealing with these more important rights – just like with the " strict scrutiny" test in the United States – the proper purpose required should be pressing or compelling. When dealing with the rest of the rights, it is suf cient for the social purpose to be designated as important. Furthermore, when examining such proper purposes I suggest the development of new rules to distinguish between cases in which the proper purpose is to protect another right and those where the proper purpose relates to the protection of the public interest. Concerning the " rational connection" component, it is suggested that the current probability test be adjusted in such a fashion that if the law in question limits a high-ranked constitutional right then the probability required to fulf ll this purpose should be "substantial" (and not be satisf ed with non-negligible probability). For all other rights, the probability required should be reasonable.

 Most of the other suggestions are intended for proportionality stricto sensu . 57 It is proposed to recognize an intermediate level of balancing between the basic rule of balancing and specif c ( ad hoc ) cases of balancing. T is intermediate level is based upon principled balancing formulas. It stems from the basic rule, but also studies several typical cases, and then incorporates the data into several formulas of constitutional limitations (in a level of abstraction that is lower than the basic balancing, but higher than that of the concrete one). Such a level of abstraction will properly express the principle considerations that lie at the heart of both the right itself and the justif cation for its limitation. Accordingly, for example, in the conf ict between the right to political free speech, on the one hand, and the protection of the public from the possible damage of "f ghting words" or inciting speech, on the other, it may be determined that it would be possible to limit the right of free speech if, and only if, the purpose of protecting the public from the ef ect of such speech is pressing or compelling in order to prevent an imminent and severe harm to the public order. T is principled balance approach is analyzed and compared

to its American counterpart, while reviewing both the similarities and dif erences between the two.

 I am neither a philosopher nor a political scientist. Rather, I am a judge and scholar of constitutional law. T is book is not about the philosophy of law or of political theory. It is rather an analytical essay in constitutional law that deals with the doctrine of justifying the limitation of constitutional rights and its limits. It is meant to be read by legal scholars, judges, and practitioners interested in those issues. T e aim is that the comparative study included in these pages enrich the reader and bring them closer to the methodology of proportionality and the justif able limitations on constitutional rights.

# Constitutional rights: scope and the extent of their protection

### **A. Te nature of the distinction**

### 1. Scope and protection

T e modern theory of constitutional rights was formed af er the Second World War. 1 It draws a fundamental distinction between the scope of the constitutional right, 2 and the extent of its protection. 3T e scope of the constitutional right marks the right's boundaries and def nes its content; the extent of its protection prescribes the legal limitations on the exercise of the right within its scope. It def nes the justif cations for the right's limitation by a sub-constitutional law – e.g., statute or common law. 4 Following this distinction, the modern theory of constitutional rights is said to be based on a two-stage analysis. 5 In the f rst stage, the constitutional right's

scope is determined, 6 and the area it covers is def ned. Both the right's "positive" scope (i.e., what should be done to protect the right) and its "negative" scope (i.e., what should be done not to af ect it) are determined. 7 T e right's "core" is def ned, as well as its "penumbra." 8T e right's content is prescribed. Finally, the right's boundaries – what separates it from other constitutional rights – are drawn. T e second stage examines whether constitutional justif cations exist to limit the realization of the right by a sub-constitutional law (e.g., by statute or common law). Specif cally, this stage examines whether the legal system provides the constitutional right with full-scope protection or a more limited one. T is stage examines the extent to which the right may be realized – either to its full extent or with limitations – at the sub-constitutional level. In this manner, the current theory of constitutional rights distinguishes between the boundaries of the constitutional right ("scope") and the limitations imposed upon its realization by law ("protection"). T e right's boundaries determine its position in the universe of constitutional rights. T ey draw the entire spectrum of "the constitutional f eld" 9 and the "contours" of the constitutional right or its Normbereich .

T ese limitations operate under the constitutional authorization to limit the realization of the constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law. T e constitutional authorization of those limitations is of en found in special constitutional provisions dubbed "limitation clauses." 11 At the heart of these limitation clauses lies the principle of proportionality. 12 Modern theory therefore distinguishes between the

 remedies for the violation of constitutional rights. T is stage is beyond the scope of this book.

constitutional right per se and its proportional limitations by a sub-constitutional law; between the constitutional right's clauses and constitutional limitation clauses (the latter allowing a sub-constitutional law to limit the realization of a constitutional right). T is distinction is at the heart of the two-stage analysis, which consists of the determination of the right's scope, and the determination of the right's limitations. T erefore, the distinction is also known as the two-stage theory.

# 2. T e distinction in practice: the scope of freedom of expression and its protection

T e distinction between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of its implementation is clearly demonstrated by Article 10(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 13 T e article reads:

> Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. T is right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. T is article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.

 Article 10(1) determines the scope of the right to freedom of expression. According to its interpretation, its scope is extremely broad, covering all forms of expression (such as books, paintings, and movies) and all forms of the expression's content (including racist hate speech, libel, or obscenity). 14 However, despite the right's broad scope, the convention contains a clause which allows for the limitation of the exercise of this freedom. Article 10(2) of the Convention, which is a special limitation clause, def nes the circumstances under which it is justif able to limit the right to freedom of expression:

> T e exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, for the protection of the reputation or rights of others,

for preventing the disclosure of information received in conf dence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.

T us, according to the article, limitations may be imposed upon the exercise of the right to freedom of expression by a law in order to protect a person's reputation, to prevent an individual or group from hate speech, or to restrict pornographic expression. 15 T ese limitations must be "necessary in a democratic society," or, in other words, they must be proportional. 16

### **B. Te centrality of the distinction**

T e modern distinction between the scope of a constitutional right and the extent of its protection at the sub-constitutional level is of major importance for several reasons. 17 First, it emphasizes the considerable weight granted by the legal system to the individual's right and the need to respect it. It demonstrates the need for a justif cation each time a limitation is imposed upon that right through statute or common law. 18 T e burden of proof of such a justif cation falls on the state. 19 Second, the distinction highlights the dif erence between the constitutional level, where rights are determined and their scope is prescribed, and the sub-constitutional level, where the extent of the right's realization (application) is determined and its limitations prescribed. Such a dichotomy between the constituent body (which determines the constitutional nature of the right, as well as the mechanism for amending its scope), and the legislative body (which determines the means for realizing these constitutional rights) is of cardinal importance. In a constitutional democracy, this dichotomy provides the individual or the minority with the shield to be used against a possible tyranny of rights by the majority. 20T is dichotomy may also assist in properly shaping the public discourse about constitutional rights and sets up boundaries regarding the areas wherein society's daily politics can intervene. T ird, the distinction between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of its protection properly exemplif es the twofold role of the modern constitutional judge – as an interpreter of the constitutional rights and as an adherent of the constitutional rule

criticism of Webber, see below, at 494. 18 See below, at 458. 19 See below, at 439. 20 See R. Den Otter, Judicial Review in an Age of Moral Pluralism (Cambridge University Press, 2009).

where limitations of such rights may not exceed those prescribed by the limitation clause (itself a part of the constitution). Fourth, the distinction correctly sets the parameters for the dialogue between the legislative and judicial branches. 21 Finally, the distinction sets forth an analytical framework to describe the scope of constitutional rights, and provides a structured and transparent way of thinking regarding the justif cation in limiting the realization of those constitutional rights through sub constitutional law. 22

 One may question the legitimacy of including in the right's scope portions whose realization or protection cannot be justif ed. T e response to this is that the extent of the right's realization or protection changes from time to time and from one issue to another, ref ecting the needs of the time and place. Indeed, the extent of the right's protection only ref ects the views of a given legal community at a given point in time. T e scope of the right itself, on the other hand, ref ects the fundamental principles upon which the community is built, as interpreted according to the rules of constitutional interpretation. 23 A change in the right's scope comes only via constitutional amendment or a change in the court's interpretation of the constitutional text. Contrary to a change in the right's scope – which must be ref ected at the constitutional level – a change of the extent of the right's protection occurs at the sub-constitutional level. As such, social

T e Knesset [2006] IsrSC 61(1) 619, available in Hebrew at http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les/02/270/064/ a22/02064270.a22.HTM , on the advantages provided by the distinction between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of its protection: "T e distinction [between the scope of the right] provides proper tools for legal analysis; it serves to clarify the analysis and ref ne the thought-process … Here it sheds light on the fundamental division in human rights discourse between the scope of the protected right and the extent of its protection, or legal realization … It is used as an analytical basis for the distinction between horizontal balancing (in the f rst stage of the constitutional analysis) and vertical balancing (in the second stage), between several intersecting human rights, and the balancing between those rights and other social values and interests … It also assists drawing the line between the role of the court as interpreter of the right as it appears in the fundamental text (constitution, basic law, convention), and the court's role in reviewing the constitutionality of its infringement by a lower legal norm. Further, the distinction helps to examine legal doctrines, such as af rmative action, in that it examines whether they are properly examined within the scope of the constitutional right to equality, or whether they should be examined as a part the extent of its protection as proportionally prescribed by the limitation clause. Finally, it helps resolve controversies over the burden of persuasion." See below, at 460. 23 On constitutional interpretation, see below, at 45.

change may lead to new laws, which protects the constitutional right according to society's current social understanding. Such change – as understood by the constitutional democracy approach – can only be carried out in accordance with the requirements prescribed by the limitation clause. In other words, they must be proportional. Such proportionality is achieved only if these changes are viewed on the one hand as limiting the right, but adhering to the justif cation required by the limitation clause on the other.

T erefore, the distinction between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of its realization or protection is a distinction between the constitutional and sub-constitutional levels. 24 It is central to the understanding of all modern constitutional rights law. T e distinction, however, does not constitute an analytical necessity. Even without it a full-scale framework of constitutional rights may exist. T ink of a system breaking the two analytical stages down into one, creating, in essence, a single constitutional provision concurrently determining both the right's scope and the extent of its protection. Most legal systems today do not combine these two stages. T ey use the two-stage distinction between a constitutional right and its proportional limitation; between the question of the scope of the right and the question of its proper realization. 25 Some systems – the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Victoria (Australia) – distinguish between these two stages, although they are both at the subconstitutional level. In addition, in these cases, the distinction between scope and protection may be relevant, as will be discussed in Chapter 6 .26

### **C. Te distinction in comparative law**

 An early manifestation of the modern distinction between the right's scope and the extent of its protection can be found in the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 27 T e Declaration contains a list of human rights that seem, at f rst glance, absolute. But a

<sup>27</sup> Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

general limitation clause relating to those rights appears at the end of the Declaration. Article 29(2) of the Declaration reads:

> In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society.

T erefore, a unique feature of the Declaration is the general scope of its limitation clause. T e clause applies to each and every right mentioned therein. It provides a general meaning, regarding all constitutional rights, to the principle of proportionality. 28 A dif erent approach is taken by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 29 T e Convention does not contain a general limitation clause, but rather several specif c clauses, each of which applies to a dif erent right. One of these clauses, specif cally related to the right of freedom of expression, was discussed earlier. 30T is, and the other specif c limitation clauses included in the Convention are based upon the principle of proportionality. 31

 Several conventions on rights have been signed since the 1950s. 32 An impressive number of constitutions were written by post-Second World War democracies, which include chapters on rights. 33 Each of these

documents dif erentiates between the scope of the right and the extent of its realization. 34 Some of the documents contain general limitation clauses, while others contain specif c ones; still others contain a combination of both. Noted examples of general limitation clauses include the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982 (Article 1), the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Article 36) and the Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty (Article 8). 35 All the limitation clauses – whether general or specif c – are manifestations of the notion of proportionality.

### **D. Tree stages of constitutional judicialreview**

T e theoretical distinction between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of its realization, or protection, leads to the conclusion that the judicial review of a statute's constitutionality should be conducted in three stages. T e f rst stage examines whether the statute limits a constitutional right. To do so, the court must interpret the relevant article of the constitutional text as well as that of the statute allegedly limiting that right. T e constitutional provision is interpreted according to rules of constitutional interpretation. 36 T e statute is interpreted according to rules of statutory interpretation. 37 At the end of the f rst stage, the judge must determine whether the statute limits a constitutional right. If the answer is "no," the constitutional examination ends there and there is no need to proceed to the next stage. However, should the judge determine that the statute limits a constitutional right, the examination should continue on to the next stage.

T e second stage of judicial review examines whether the limitation of the constitutional right is constitutional. Here, the judge examines whether

Summers, Interpreting Statutes: A Comparative Study (Aldershot: Dartmouth, 1991); W. N. Eskridge Jr., Dynamic Statutory Interpretation (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1994 ); F.

<sup>34</sup> See Gardbaum, above note 25.

the limiting statute abides by the conditions set by the limitation clause – in other words, whether the limitations are proportional. T is is the stage where the judge examines the justif cations to not allow for the complete fulf llment of the right's scope. If the judge concludes that the limitation is proportional, the review ends there. Conversely, should the judge conclude that the limitation is not proportional, that the constitutional right has been violated, they must continue to the third and f nal stage.

T e third stage examines the ef ects of the unconstitutionality of the statute. T is is a remedial stage. A discussion of this stage is beyond the scope of this book.

### **E. Absolute rights**

### 1. Are there absolute constitutional rights?

 Most constitutional rights enjoy only partial protection. T ey cannot be realized to the full extent of their scope as their limitation can be justif ed. T e extent of their protection is narrower than their scope. T ese rights will be referred to as relative rights. 38 Relative rights do not constitute the entire universe of constitutional rights. Modern constitutional law made several – albeit rare – exceptions to the partial protection rule, by recognizing a number of constitutional rights as absolute. 39 T ese rights cannot be limited. T e extent of their protection or realization is equal to their scope as their limitation cannot be justif ed. Strictly speaking, every right – once its limitations are grasped to be constitutional in relation to a given set of facts – may be referred to as "absolute" in relation to that set of facts. But this is a truism, a trivialization of the notion of an absolute right, which will not be used here. T e term is used in the sense that a right is absolute if, and only if, its scope is fully protected in the sub-constitutional dimension – i.e., that the extent of its protection or realization is equal to its scope. One example of such an absolute right is the widely accepted constitutional prohibition of slavery. 40 Another example can be found in Article 1(1) of the German Constitution ( Grundgesetz ), which reads:

> Human dignity shall be inviolable [ unantastbar ]. To respect and protect it shall be the duty of all state authority.

- 
- UK Human Rights Act (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 257. 39 Also called unqualif ed rights: see Kavanagh, above note 38, at 257. 40 See, e.g., US Const., Am. XIII § 1 ("Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude … shall exist within the United States."); Universal Declaration of Human Rights, above note 27,

<sup>38</sup> T ey are also called qualif ed rights: see A. Kavanagh, Constitutional Review under the

T e interpretation of this provision provides that the German constitutional right to human dignity cannot be limited. T e German courts ruled that neither the need to protect other individual rights, nor the general public interest, can justify a limitation on that right. As such, the right to human dignity in Germany is absolute. 41 In a recent case, the German Constitutional Court examined the constitutionality of a 9/11-prevention-type statute. T e statute allowed a state agency to order the interception and shooting down a civilian passenger airplane if it is obvious that the plane was hijacked by terrorists and that it is about to crash in a location that would lead to the injury of innocent bystanders. 42 Importantly, the statute allowed for the shooting down of the plane even when there was tangible knowledge of innocent passengers being held hostage. T e court held that the statute was unconstitutional, as it limited the innocent hostages' right to human dignity. Human dignity, the court reasoned, is an absolute right that cannot be limited. 43 Amongst other things, the absolute nature of the right dictates that humans should never be treated as merely a means to the end of protecting other humans. T e statute in question violates the hostages' human dignity, as it turns the innocent hostages into human shields for other innocent people. Accordingly, it was held that the statute cannot stand.

 Another example of an absolute right can be found in Article 3 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and fundamental freedoms. T e article reads:

> No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.

T is prohibition is absolute. 44 T e public interest, or the rights of other individuals, cannot diminish the extent of its protection. Its scope is

equal to its coverage. In a similar context, the Israeli Supreme Court was called upon to examine whether the state – through its secret service – may allow for the use of torture in interrogations of terrorist suspects. T e court's answer was no. Writing for the court, I emphasized that:

> A reasonable interrogation is an interrogation without torture, without cruel or inhuman treatment of the suspect, and without degrading his person … Human dignity entails the human dignity of the interrogated suspect. Such a conclusion is commensurate with basic principles of public international law … T ese restrictions are "absolute" – they have no exceptions, and they require no balancing. 45

# 2. T e jurisprudence of absolute rights

T e notion of absolute rights is not without controversy. Some legal commentators question the mere concept of a jurisprudentially recognized absolute right (i.e., a right without limitations). 46 T ere are those who believe that every right is relative; that even the most signif cant of rights can be limited. 47 Other scholars are of the opinion that there should be no principled objection to the recognition of absolute rights. Gewirth, for example, while basing his argument on Aristotelian ethics, provides the example of a mother's absolute right not to be tortured to death by her own son. 48 Gewirth asserts that such a right is absolute even in the extreme case where, as a result of the son's refusal to torture his mother to death, a group of terrorists would use a nuclear weapon against a large peaceful city. Indeed, the literature on this subject is vast and replete with examples of preventing catastrophes. Other writers deal with more conventional cases. A well-known example in this context is the "Trolley Problem."49 Suppose you are the driver of a railway trolley whose brakes have failed. You are about to hit and fatally wound a group of f ve rail workers. T is fatal accident can be completely avoided by pushing another workman, John Doe, onto the tracks – to his own certain death. Does Mr. Doe have an absolute right not to be pushed onto the tracks – and to his death – even

<sup>48</sup> See A. Gewirth, "Are T ere Any Absolute Rights?," Philosophical Quarterly 31 ( 1981 ), 1. 49 See generally, J. J. T omson, "T e Trolley Problem," 94 Yale L. J . 1395 ( 1985 ).

while recognizing that f ve other people would certainly lose their lives because of that? Suppose now that the trolley can change its course and divert to another spur of tracks, thus saving the group of f ve workmen; the only issue is that Mr. Doe is now standing on that spur of tracks and is unable to escape the coming trolley on time. T us, a change of course would directly lead to the death of Mr. Doe. Does Mr. Doe have an absolute right, under these circumstances, not to be fatally injured, even at the price of f ve other lives? Is there a dif erence between the two cases? And how important is the size of the group about to be injured?

T e examination of these questions – which, until recently, were considered theoretical in nature – has unfortunately turned very practical due to the increasing number of terrorist attacks on peaceful communities around the world. Do terrorists have an absolute constitutional right not to be tortured when their investigation may lead to many lives being saved? Do innocent hostages, kidnapped by terrorists, have an absolute constitutional right not to pay with their lives to save a larger number of people? T ese and many other questions await their answer, in both the legal and ethical spheres. In this book no attempt is made to contribute to this debate. Its only purpose is to add an additional dimension to the dispute. Much of the literature dealing with the jurisprudence of constitutional rights tends to ignore the basic distinction between the constitutional level (where the right's scope is determined) and the legislative level (where its limitations are set). A typical example is the question of whether a property owner has the right to prevent a fatally injured person's entry onto his premises, even if the latter action is likely to save that person's life. According to the constitutional right two-stage model, a solution to the problem can be found along the following lines: While the scope of a constitutionally protected right to property includes the right to refuse entry to any person, the legislator may conclude that the right should not be exercised – i.e., be limited under certain justif ed circumstances. One of these circumstances may be when a near-death experience may be avoided by entering the premises (despite the refusal of the owner). Here, again, the scope of the right is separate from the extent of the protection af orded by the legislator. If the limitations placed by the legislator on the right are proportional, the law would pass constitutional muster, and the owner would have no legal option to prevent the entry. Of course, one could argue against any justif cation of the limitation of the constitutional right to property. No attempt is made to solve that problem, but only to add an additional dimension to its analysis.

### 3. Absolute rights turned relative

 Suppose a legal system wishes to turn an absolute right into a relative one. What methods are available for it to do so? One way, as I have previously mentioned, is the use of interpretive tools. T at is the route chosen by the US Supreme Court when it approached the seemingly absolute First Amendment right of freedom of expression. What should a legal system do when it realizes, af er applying its own interpretive rules, that this avenue is blocked – that the only plausible interpretive result leaves the right as absolute? T e answer is that the remaining avenue open to that system is that of a constitutional amendment – a change to the constitutional text itself. While this avenue is available, at least in theory, in many legal systems, it does raise some dif culties. First, in some cases the text of the constitution provides that the absolute nature of the right is not amendable but rather "eternal." 50 In these circumstances, a constitutional amendment simply cannot occur. An entirely new constitution is required to achieve the desired result. An example of such an "eternal" absolute right can be found in the German Constitution. Bear in mind that Article 1(1) of the Constitution establishes the right to human dignity. According to Article 79(3), any amendment af ecting "the principles laid down in Article 1 … shall be inadmissible." 51 T erefore, the absolute nature of this right cannot be changed even through constitutional amendment. Second, in some extreme cases, even without an express constitutional provision preventing such amendments, some courts have decided that some amendments can be viewed as so fundamentally contrary to the basic structure of the constitution itself that they may no longer be considered "f t" for the process of a constitutional amendment. 52 T ese are the "unconstitutional constitutional amendments," which require the promulgation of an entirely new constitution as the amendment of the

### **F. Relative rights**

# 1. T e nature of the relative constitutional right

T e number of absolute rights is very small. T e vast majority of constitutional rights are relative rights. A right is relative if it is not protected to the full extent of its scope. Justif ed limitations are thus placed on the right's full realization. Indeed, we can say that a right is relative whenever the extent of its protection is narrower than its entire scope. T e right is relative in that limitations may be imposed on actions or omissions that are otherwise included within its scope. In other words, the right is relative in that, with the determination of its scope, the legal system creates a constitutional mechanism which allows for the imposition of limitations on the realization of that scope. Limitation clauses (both general and specif c), and the principle of proportionality at their core, ref ect the relativity of the right. 54

## 2. Boundaries and limitations

### i. Types of provisions

T e notion of relative rights may encounter analytical dif culties whenever the constitutional provision def ning that right also contains an internal modifying element. Does the mere existence of such an element

<sup>53</sup> See the Symposium on Unconstitutional Constitutional Amendment in 44 Israel Law

Review (forthcoming 2011). 54 See International Transport Roth GmbH v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] 3 WLR 344: "Even rights which are not absolute … can be interfered with only to an extent which is proportionate. However compelling the social goal, there are limits to how the individual's interest can legitimately be sacrif ced"; HCJ 8276/05 Adalah – T e Legal Center for the Rights of the Arab Minority v. Minister of Defense [2006] (2) IsrLR 352, para. 26: "T e concept of a limitation clause is premised on the notion that human rights will always stand side-by-side with human duties; that we do not live on an island, but rather are a part of society; that the interests of that society may justify limitations on the rights humans have; and that therefore those rights are not absolute, but relative. T e limitation clause ref ects the view that human rights may be limited, but also that these limitations have their legal limits … Indeed, human rights do not receive full legal protection according with their scope. T e constitutional structure prevents the realization of the rights to their fullest extent." (Barak, P.).

turn the right into a relative one? Should this element be treated as an internal, specif c limitation clause? Should the rules of proportionality apply to this element? Take, for example, the right to assemble as def ned by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:

> Everyone has the right, peacefully and unarmed, to assemble, to demonstrate, to picket and to present petitions. 55

 Is this right to assemble – def ned with the internal element of "peacefully and unarmed" – a relative right? T e answer is naturally yes, as the general limitation clause included in the South African Constitution 56 – which applies to each of the enumerated human rights – applies to this right as well. But does the relativity of the right to assemble stem solely from the presence of the general limitation clause? Could we not say that the right is relative by virtue of its own provision? T e answer to that question is no. T e words "peacefully and unarmed" do not ref ect a limitation on the constitutional right, but rather make up a part of its def nition. According to this view, 57 there are two types of constitutional provisions relating to rights: T e f rst includes constitutional provisions determining the boundaries of the right that contain internal qualif ers of the right's scope; the second includes constitutional provisions determining the circumstances in which the right – according to its determined scope – can be justif ably limited within the sub-constitutional level. T e provision containing the expression "peacefully and unarmed" belongs to the f rst type. It determines the scope of the constitutional right, not its limitations. I will elaborate further on this distinction. I will begin with provisions determining the right's scope.

# ii. Provisions determining the right's scope

T ese provisions, according to their proper constitutional interpretation, def ne the right's scope. Naturally, these provisions are linked to the right's def nition as it appears in the constitutional text and assist in the proper interpretation of such def nitions. 58T ey do not turn the right

- proportionality). 58 See I. Currie and J. de Waal, T e Bill of Rights Handbook , 5th edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, 2006 ), 186 ("T eir purpose is def nitional: def ning the scope of the right

into a relative one. T ey do not prescribe limitations on the realization of the right within its proper boundaries through sub-constitutional provisions. T us, the constitutional right to assemble in South Africa – a right which, according to its def nition, can only apply to "peaceful and unarmed" activities – is not a relative right due to the qualifying text which appears as part of its def ning provision. Such qualif cations relate only to the determination of the right's boundaries and its proper scope. T ey do not relate to the ways in which the right can be realized, or to the extent of its protection. T e same is true for Article 16 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, which def nes the right to freedom of expression (in subsection (1)), and then provides (in subsection (2)):

T e right in subsection (1) does not extend to—

- (a) Propaganda for war;
- (b) Incitement of imminent violence; or
- (c) Advocacy or hatred that is based on race, ethnicity, gender or religion, and that constitutes incitement to cause harm.

T is provision narrows the scope of the constitutional right to freedom of expression in South Africa. It does not express an opinion on the issue of whether limitations may be placed on the ways in which that constitutional right may be realized. Such limitations may be imposed in accordance with the general constitutional limitation clause (which can be found in Article 36 thereof). T e mere existence of the general limitation clause is what turns the right into a relative one. Accordingly, Article 16(2) is not a provision limiting the constitutional right to freedom of expression, but rather a provision that helps determine the right's scope. Such provisions should not be seen as "internal limitations" of the right, 59 but rather as "internal modif ers," "internal qualif ers," 60 or "demarcations." 61 Importantly, they contain a part of the right's scope and not a part the extent of its protection.

#### Constitutional rights: scope and extent of protection 35

### iii. Provisions which set forth limitations on the realization

 Provisions that place limitations on the realization of the constitutional right – within its proper scope – through the use of sub-constitutional laws are termed provisions determining the extent of the right's protection. T ey turn any constitutional right to which they apply into a relative right. T ey do not af ect the right's scope. T ey do not determine its boundaries. T ey do not def ne its reach. T ey do, however, create a constitutional possibility to limit the constitutional right through a subconstitutional provision within the right's boundaries. T ese are the limitation clauses.

 A prominent example of such a provision can be found in Article 10(2) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms discussed earlier. 62 Remember that this article specif es several constitutional limitations that may be placed on the realization of the right. T ese limitations do not af ect the scope of the right, but rather af ect the extent of its protection and the ways in which it can be realized. Sometimes these limitations are "general" – that is, they apply to all the rights included in a given constitution. Sometimes they are "specif c," or "special" – that is, they apply to only one specif c right. 63

### iv. T e importance of the distinction

 In most cases, the distinction between the two types of provisions – internal qualifying provisions and specif c limitation clauses – is clear and straightforward, and therefore easy to implement. However, in some cases, the distinction is not so clear. T is is important, as the distinction serves both theoretical and practical purposes. T eoretically, the distinction may assist in determining the nature of the right as absolute or relative. Practically speaking, the distinction may prove essential in several

63 See Currie and de Waal, above note 58, at 187: "A few rights … are qualif ed by language that specif cally demarcates their scope. Such qualif cations can be termed demarcations of that right. T eir purpose is def nitional: def ning the scope of the right more precisely than is the case with the textually unqualif ed rights … Other textual qualif cations of rights create criteria for the limitation of certain rights by the legislature. T ese are more properly called special limitations. Engaging in any form of limitation analysis … assumes that an infringement of a right has been established. T is means that reliance on a special limitation clause is a second-stage matter. At the f rst stage the person relying on the right has to show that an infringement has taken place. Once shown, at the second stage, the state or the person relying on the validity of legislation must show that the limitation of the right is justif ed either by reference to a special limitation clause or the general criteria of Art. 36." See also Cheadle, Haysom, and Davis, above note 59, at 701.

<sup>62</sup> See above, at 21.

contexts. One such context involves the use of the balancing prescribed by the general limitation clause. As we shall see, 64 the rules of proportionality written into the general limitation clause require the balancing of several constitutional elements. Is the application of this balancing test appropriate when examining the internal qualif ers (which determine the right's scope)? In other words, can the balancing rules included in the general limitation clause also be used for the scope-determining qualif ers? Take the South African constitutional right to demonstrate "peacefully and unarmed." Bear in mind that this constitution also contains a general limitation clause. T e question is, should the balancing and proportionality considerations used by the general limitation clause also be applied in determining the scope of the right itself? My answer to this question is in the negative. T e general limitation clause – and the proportionality and balancing considerations used by it – should play no part in the interpretation of the internal qualif ers. T e limitation clause applies if, and only if, a constitutional right is limited by a sub-constitutional law. T e internal qualif er does not limit the constitutional right, but rather def nes its scope more narrowly. Indeed, the examination of the internal qualif er's proper range is in its essence a question of constitutional interpretation. T e question is what is the proper reach of the right, considering the factors at the basis of the right. T e answer to the said question takes into consideration the reasons underlying the qualifying provision. T is is an "internal" constitutional examination, relating to the essence of the right itself. It is not af ected by external considerations, such as public interest considerations or the rights of other individuals.65 It would be inappropriate, therefore, to either consider or balance, within the interpretive process of the qualifying provision which determines the right's scope, the same set of factors that are considered to be within the limitation clause's proportionality rules. T ere may be occasions where an interpretive inquiry would reveal two conf icting principles that reside side-by-side within the internal qualifying provision. In these cases, the interpretive examination of the qualif er may require a resolution of such a conf ict through a balancing test. While this resolution does constitute an interpretive balancing act, it does not constitute – and should not be considered as – an application of the limitation clause. T e issue of

<sup>64</sup> See below, at 343.

<sup>65</sup> See Woolman and Botha, above note 5, at 3: "T e internal modif er is concerned with a determination of the content of the right and not with an analysis of competing rights or interests."

interpretive balancing and its relation to limitation clause balancing will be discussed in later chapters. 66

 Another practical context where the distinction between internal qualifying provisions and general limitation clauses plays a central role is in the evidentiary realm of the burden of proof. If the case at hand involves internal qualifying provisions, since they constitute a part of the right itself, the burden of proof (both the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence) in the f rst stage of the constitutional examination – attempting to establish whether a right has been limited – lies with the party arguing that the right, within its proper scope (of which the internal qualifying is a part), was in fact limited. 67 T e burden of proof shif s in the second stage of the examination to the party arguing that the limitation on that right is justif ed – that the limitation abides by all the requirements of the limitation clause, or in other words, it is proportional. 68

### **G. Constitutionalrights: prima facie or defnite?**

### 1. T e problem presented

T e distinction between the scope of a constitutional right and the extent of its justif able limitation leads to dif culty when answering a basic question: is a constitutional right a def nite right or a prima facie right? T e answer to this question requires an examination of the concept of prima facie rights. 69 It directly relates to the problem of conf icting constitutional rights and to the attempt to resolve such conf icts. 70 A thorough discussion of these issues is beyond the parameters of this book. T e discussion here will be limited to the part of the question relating to the constitutional right and its scope. No attempt will be made to confront the general jurisprudential claim that all constitutional rights are merely prima facie rights. T e argument here is, rather, that, when a constitution def nes a

right ("scope"), and at the same time allows for the placement of justif able limitations upon the realization of that right through sub-constitutional law ("the extent of its protection"), the existence of the power to limit the realization of the right, in and of itself, cannot turn the constitutional right into a prima facie right.

### 2. T e prima facie constitutional right: Alexy's view

 Alexy 71 begins his discussion of constitutional norms with a distinction between rules and principles. 72 Constitutional principles, according to Alexy, consist of "optimization requirements … norms which require that something be realized to the greatest extent possible given the legal and factual possibilities." 73T ose legal and factual possibilities are the rules of proportionality. Contrary to the principles, according to Alexy, constitutional rules "are norms which are always either fulf lled or not. If a rule validly applies, then the requirement is to do exactly what it says, neither more nor less." 74 Accordingly, a conf ict between constitutional rights formed as rules is resolved either through the invalidation of one of the rules, or by reading an exception to it. Conversely, a conf ict between competing constitutional rights formed as principles is resolved only when one of the principles is outweighed at the point of conf ict, but not through invalidation. 75

 What is the status of each constitutional principle at the precise point of conf ict? According to Alexy, it is only at that point that the conditions are set for one principle to outweigh the other. T ese conditions are set in accordance with the constitutional rules of proportionality, which prescribe the set of permitted limitations – both legal and factual – on these constitutional principles. T ese conditions ref ect the recognition of a new constitutional rule. T is is a derivative constitutional rule, created by both conf icting principles. At the precise point of conf ict, this rule determines which principle should outweigh the other. As Alexy puts it:

> [T]he result of every correct balancing of constitutional rights can be formulated in terms of a derivative constitutional rights norm in the form of a rule under which the case can be subsumed. 76

- 
<sup>71</sup> On Alexy and his analytical contribution to the study of constitutional rights, see Introduction, above, at 5. 72 Alexy, above note 3, at 47.

<sup>73</sup> Ibid . By "given the legal and factual possibilities," Alexy refers to the proportionality rules. 74 Ibid ., at 48. 75 Ibid . 76 Ibid ., at 56.

### Constitutional rights: scope and extent of protection 39

 According to Alexy's analysis, constitutional principles are not def nitive. T ey are the reasons for the action and can be overcome with opposing reasons. T e relationship between these reasons is determined by the factual and legal possibilities, namely, the proportionality of their realization in a given situation. T eir use in a given case is always subject to the derivative rule – ref ecting their legal and factual limitation – which overcomes them. It is through these assumptions that Alexy concludes that all constitutional rights formed as principles merely represent prima facie rights rather than def nite ones. In his words:

> [P]rinciples can only ever be prima facie reasons . In and of themselves they can only create prima facie rights … T e route from the principle, that is, the prima facie right, to the def nitive right runs by way of relation of preference. But establishing a preference relation is, according to the Law of Competing Principles, to create a rule. We can therefore say that whenever a principle turns out to be the dominant reason for a concrete ought-judgment, then the principle is a reason for a rule, which in turn is the def nitive reason for the judgment. Principles in themselves are never def nitive reasons. 77

 According to Alexy's approach, whenever a limitation on a prima facie constitutional right is proportional, the right itself is af ected in that its scope is diminished. T is prima facie scope, according to Alexy, is very wide, since "everything which the relevant constitutional principle suggests should be protected falls within the scope" of the right. 78 Alexy's approach to the determination of the prima facie scope of the right is, therefore, very broad. However, the constitutional derivative rule that is created as a result of the application of the proportionality rule narrows the right's otherwise broad scope. T at narrowing, however, applies only in the situation's unique circumstances. In those circumstances the constitutional right no longer exists.

# 3. Def nite constitutional rights that cannot be realized

 Unlike Alexy, I believe that limitations of principle-formed constitutional rights do not af ect their scope, even in concrete cases. I do accept that, whenever two constitutional rights (which are formed as principles) conf ict, a new constitutional derivative rule is created that ref ects the proportional balance between those rights. 79 However, according to my

<sup>77</sup> Ibid ., at 60. 78 Ibid ., at 210. 79 On the conf ict between constitutional rights, see below, at 83.

approach, this derivative constitutional rule can only operate within the sub-constitutional level. It af ects only the realization of the constitutional right on the sub-constitutional level. 80 It has no ef ect at the constitutional level. It is unable to narrow the scope of the constitutional right itself. In other words, the ef ects of the derivative constitutional rule – which ref ects the proportionality requirements set by the limitation clause – only operates at the level of the limiting statute or common law. It af ects the constitutionality of the statute. It cannot have any ef ect on the scope of the right. T is is true for all limitation clause (proportionality) rules. T ey do not operate at the constitutional level.

 A key component of this approach is the understanding that a constitutional right is not a prima facie right, but rather, a def nite right. 81 Take, for example, the right to freedom of expression. When considered within its entire scope, it is def nite and complete. However, due to the need to protect the rights of others or public interest considerations, the right to freedom of expression cannot be realized to its fullest extent (divulging state secrets, for example, is illegal). But these limitations on the realization of the right do not operate at the constitutional level. T e scope of the right has not changed. Rather, the limitations only operate at the sub-constitutional level. T ey can be found in statutes or common law that limits the extent of the protection of the right of one person in favor of promoting other constitutionally recognized principles. T is is the ef ect – both factual and legal – of the proportionality requirements set by the limitation clause.

 Alexy's approach, according to which there are only prima facie principle-formed constitutional rights, stems from his general perception of the principle. According to Alexy, a principle is an optimization requirement that may be realized to the greatest extent possible given the legal and factual possibilities. 82 T e "legal and factual possibilities" mentioned by Alexy are the constitutional rules of proportionality. T erefore, the notion of proportionality, according to Alexy, must be seen as part of the very def nition of a constitutional principle. T e conclusion that every principle – and every constitutional right formed as a principle – is only a prima facie principle is a necessary conclusion.

T is approach to the principles, however, is not analytically compelled. 83 According to my view, a legal norm formed as a principle is made up of fundamental values. T ese values in turn ref ect ideals aspiring to be

<sup>80</sup> See below, at 89. 81 See Zucca, above note 46, at 60. 82 See Alexy, above note 3, at 47.

<sup>83</sup> T e attempt to properly def ne the term "legal principle" has yielded voluminous literature. See, e.g., H. Avila, T eory of Legal Principles (Dordrecht: Springer, 2007 ); M. Sachs

realized to their maximum extent. In practice, however, at the sub-constitutional level, these ideals may not be realized to their full scope. T e constitutional interpretation of these values shapes their scope in accordance with each underlying reason. T e question of the realization of that right arises within the parameters of that right's predetermined scope. Again, these constitutional rights formed as principles at a high level of abstraction may be realized at the sub-constitutional level at varying degrees of intensity. T is realization is not a part of the right's scope, but only part of the extent of its protection. T e rules of proportionality def ne the extent of that realization. T ey do not form a part of the right's scope.

T erefore, according to this approach, the constitutional right formed as a principle is not a prima facie right, but a def nite right. In some cases, the realization of such a right is af ected by other principles – relating to other peoples' rights or to public interest considerations. However, in either case, the narrowing realization does not entail a diminished scope. T is narrow realization or diminished protection (limitation) – as compared with the right's full scope – speaks only to the level of intensity in which the right is realized at the sub-constitutional level. T at level does not af ect the principle's scope. T us, the options available for limiting the principle's realization do not turn the principle-formed right into a prima facie right, 84 though they may create a prima facie violation of the right. 85 T us, the right is not prima facie but, rather, def nite.

T ere are several advantages to this approach over Alexy's. First, it places the constitutional right on solid ground. T e prima facie nature of the right, conversely, may hurt its social standing, its exemplary role, and its moral capability. Second, this approach prevents constant corrosion in the scope of constitutional rights. According to Alexy, the constitutional derivative rule that limits the constitutional right's scope operates only at the lowest level of abstraction. It ref ects a case-by-case ( ad hoc ) balancing approach. However, it is well within the nature of the judicial process that case-by-case decisions are understood as providing guidance on a much higher level of abstraction, thus serving as precedents for future cases. T ird, and f nally, since the f nal results of the application of the proportionality rules are set at the sub-constitutional level, these results may

constantly be the subject of political debate and public discourse; they may change according to the day-to-day needs of society at any given period.

### **H. Isthere a constitutionalright to commit a proportional crime?**

### 1. A constitutional right to steal?

 Does it arise from the view presented that one has a constitutional right to steal? According to Alexy, the prohibition on committing criminal of enses – assuming they are proportional – excludes criminal activity from the scope of the constitutional right to private autonomy. 86 Accordingly, there is no constitutional right to steal. T is is not my approach. In my opinion, criminal activity can still be covered at the constitutional level, but properly – that is, proportionally – prohibited (limited) at the sub-constitutional level. In other words, if private autonomy constitutes a constitutional right, the act of stealing is part of that right (at the constitutional level), as it forms an action in accordance to one's private autonomy; such an act is forbidden, however, at the sub-constitutional level by a statute criminalizing the act that has been held to be proportional.

 Does this analysis suggest the existence of a constitutional right to steal? T e answer is that the only constitutional right is that of private autonomy. T ere is no separate constitutional right to steal. In Israel, the right to private autonomy is part of the constitutional right to human dignity. In other jurisdictions, it is a part of other constitutional rights such as the right to liberty. T e prohibition on stealing, on the other hand, cannot be found in the constitutions themselves. Stealing is not a constitutional concept. If the prohibition on stealing was to appear as a rule in the constitutional text itself, the scope of the constitutional right to private autonomy would be diminished accordingly. 87 It could no longer be said that that activity be included as part of the right's scope. T e same is true for every constitutionally mandated rule. However, in the absence

<sup>86</sup> I assume – together with Alexy, above note 3, at 223 – that a democratic constitution recognizes a general right to private autonomy (see Art. 2(1) of the German Grundgesetz ). Such an assumption, however, is not universally shared and is theoretically disputed by some. See Dworkin, above note 24, at 266. A review of this dispute is not required to

understand my argument, and is beyond the scope of this book. 87 In a conf ict between a constitutional rule (no stealing) and a constitutional principle (autonomy), the constitutional rule prevails. T e scope of the constitutional principle is af ected. See below, at 97.

of such a constitutional prohibition, the legal restriction on the act of thef is the product of a sub-constitutional law included in the criminal code. It is therefore in the legal area of criminal law that the concept of thef is created, and it is there that the concept's legal boundaries are set. It is criminal law that provides that stealing is prohibited. Accordingly, a constitutional right to human autonomy exists (at the constitutional level), but the availability to realize that right is limited. T is limitation is formed inter alia within the criminal law prohibition on thef . We assume that that prohibition is proportional, and therefore the limitation on the right is constitutionally valid. T e same analysis may apply not only to other criminal acts, but also to torts resulting in liability according to the law of torts, breaches of contracts sanctioned by contract law, and other types of behavior restricted by law. Importantly, all these limitations are not constitutional notions and do not operate at the constitutional level. Rather, they are notions created by the institutions of private and criminal law. T e constitutional level deals with the notion of private autonomy (or other constitutional rights). Such constitutional rights cannot be realized when private law or criminal law so prescribe, so long as that prescription is proportional and therefore constitutional.

### 2. T e criticism and a response

 It can be argued that the approach described may lead to a trivialization of the concept of constitutional rights. I cannot agree. T ere may be cases in which such an impression is made, but this is only an initial impression. T is impression, if it exists, cannot hold up to the overwhelming evidence – and social recognition – of scores of legislative determinations created precisely to properly limit the realization of these well-recognized constitutional rights. Such limitations serve as the backbone of every organized democracy. T e question of the constitutionality of such legislative determinations is considered at the second stage of the judicial constitutional review, examining whether the legislation is proportional. But not only are constitutional rights not trivialized by the existence of such a system, they are in fact elevated to a more secure analytical basis in the system as a whole. Justice Ackermann of the South African Constitutional Court has responded to the trivialization arguments:

> I cannot … comprehend why an extensive construction of freedom would "trivialize" the charter, either in theory or in practice, or, more relevantly for our purpose, our present Constitution. It might trivialize a constitution (it would indeed cause chaos) if it resulted in the regulation measures

#### 44 Constitutional rights: scope and limitations

being struck down. But that is not the consequence. An extensive construction merely requires the party relying thereon to justify it in terms of a limitation clause. It does not trivialize a constitution in theory; in fact it has the reverse ef ect by emphasizing the necessity for justifying intrusion into freedom. It does not trivialize a constitution in practice because in the vast majority of cases dealing with regulatory matters, the justif cation is so obviously incontestable that it is taken for granted and never becomes a live issue. In the borderline cases (and even in mundane regulatory statutes such cases may arise) there is no pragmatic reason why the person relying on the measure ought not to justify it. 88

# Determining the scope of constitutional rights

# **A. Te right'sscope is determined by constitutional interpretation**

	- i. Purposive interpretation

T e two-pronged analysis distinguishes between the scope of the constitutional right and the extent of the right's realization. How is the right's scope determined? T e answer is that the right's scope is determined by the interpretation of the legal text in which the right resides. When the right is within a constitutional text, the process is of constitutional interpretation. 1 T ere are several theories of constitutional interpretation. 2

Ministry of Labor and Welfare [1998] IsrSC 52(2) 433, 440 ("When the claim before us relates to a limitation on a constitutional human right, this Court has to make a determination as to the scope of that right, which can be found in the text of the Basic Law. Such determination is made according to the rules of constitutional interpretation that we have accepted. T ey are, in essence, the rules of purposive interpretation … T ese rules are a part of our purposive-interpretation doctrine. As with any other legal text, the constitutional text should also be interpreted according to the rules of purposive interpretation. With that, the special nature of the text may inf uence its purposive interpretation … T e judge has to be sensitive to the fact that he is interpreting a constitutional text; clearly, the interpretation of a regular legislative order is dif erent from the interpretation of a fundamental constitutional decree.")

T e following pages will focus on what is considered the best theory of constitutional interpretation, the theory of purposive interpretation. 3

 Constitutional interpretation comprises part of the general theory of legal interpretation. Like any legal text, the constitution should be interpreted in accordance with its purpose. T at purpose is a normative term. It is a judicial construction. It is a "legal institution." It is the ratio juris . It is the purpose the text was designed to achieve. It is the text's function. T at purpose contains both the subjective purpose, regarding the intentions of the creators of the constitutional text, and the objective purpose, as to the understanding of the text based on its role and function. T is interpretation, in turn, should take into account both the role and function played by the text at the time it was created, as well as its role and function at the time of interpretation. Purposive interpretation takes into account the special nature of the constitutional text. 4 T is nature is derived from the constitution's legal status as the supreme law of the land, as well as from its unique role in shaping the nation's image across generations. 5

T is general approach of constitutional interpretation also applies, naturally, to the interpretation of constitutional rights. T ese rights are

T ese Basic Laws were meant to shape the image of the civic society and its aspirations throughout history; they were meant to determine the nation's most basic concepts, as well as to establish a foundation for its social values; they are seeking to set the nation's aspirations, commitments, and its long-term directions.

(Barak, P.)). interpreted according to the reasons at their foundation as understood in the context of society's most fundamental values, the fundamentals of its existence, and with the basic principles shared by all constitutional rights. 6 As explained by Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court in one of the f rst cases to interpret the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: 7

> T e task of expounding a constitution is crucially dif erent from that of constructing a statute. A statute def nes present rights and obligations. It is easily enacted and as easily repealed. A constitution, by contrast, is draf ed with an eye to the future. Its function is to provide a continuing framework for the legitimate exercise of governmental power and, when joined by a Bill or a Charter of Rights, for the unremitting protection of individual rights and liberties. Once enacted, its provisions cannot easily be repealed or amended. It must, therefore, be capable of growth and development over time to meet new social, political, and historical realities of en unimagined by its framers. T e judiciary is the guardian of the constitution and must, in interpreting its provisions, bear these considerations in mind. 8

T e constitution itself, as well as the rights protected by it, enjoys a special status in the legal system. It fulf lls a function no other norm in the system can realize. 9

# ii. Purposive interpretation and the constitution's unique nature

T e special status of the constitution af ects its interpretation. What is the nature of such an interpretive ef ect? 10 What is the proper way to reconcile the notion that a constitution is, f rst and foremost, a legal text – and therefore should be interpreted according to the same rules and principles that apply to the interpretation of every other legal text – with

6 See CA 6821/93 United Mizrahi Bank Ltd . v. Migdal Cooperative Village [1995] IsrLR 1 ("T e scope of each constitutional right is determined by the process of its interpretation. T is is constitutional interpretation. It is sensitive to the nature of the interpreted document in question. Indeed, 'it is the constitution that we are expounding …'. T us, the interpretation of a standard legislative provision is not the same as the interpretation of a basic constitutional provision … Constitutional interpretation is directed by the criteria set by constitutional purpose … Such constitutional purpose can be deduced from the language used by the text, its history, culture, and the nation's fundamental principles … A constitutional provision was not created in a constitutional vacuum, and does not

the notion that a constitution is also a unique legal text, requiring its own interpretive approach? T e answer can be found within the concept of purposive interpretation. T e process of purposive interpretation ref ects, on the one hand, the notion of purposive unity applying to all legal texts, and, on the other hand, takes into account the unique nature of the constitutional text. Purposive interpretation of the constitution – as the purposive interpretation of every legal text – takes into account both the intention of the text's creators (subjective purpose) as well as the system's "intention" as a whole (objective purpose). Constitutional purposive interpretation does not subscribe to the notion that only the framers' intention – or any other creators of the constitutional text – should determine its interpretation. To the same extent, constitutional purposive interpretation rejects the notion that only the understanding of the text according to its values at the time of interpretation should determine the meaning of the constitutional text. Rather, constitutional purposive interpretation, with its holistic approach, takes into account both subjective and objective purposes when approaching the constitutional text. T e constitutional purpose is therefore a synthesis between the study of the subjective purpose, as provided by the constitutional text and other external sources, and from the objective purpose, as provided again by the constitutional text and external sources. T e special nature of the constitution is demonstrated by the internal relationship between its subjective and objective purposes, between the framers' intention and that of the system as a whole. Here, in case of a conf ict the latter "intention" will have the upper hand. 11

### iii. Constitutional text

**a. A constitutional text, not a metaphor** Constitutional interpretation is bound by the constitutional text. 12 As a rule, constitutional language is not dif erent from the language used by other legal texts. T en again, a typical constitutional provision of en contains more vague 13 or open-textured terms 14 than can be found in other legal texts. T is is even

<sup>11</sup> See ibid ., at 371. See also Du Plessis, above note 1, at para. 32–42. 12 See Barak, above note 3, at 373.

Baden: Nomos Verlagsgesellschaf , 1983 ), 89. 14 See W. Brennan, "T e Constitution of the United States: Contemporary Ratif cation," 27 Tex. L. Rev . 433 ( 1986 ); B. McLachlin, "T e Charter: A New Role for the Judiciary," 29 Alta. L. Rev . 540, 545 ( 1991 ).

more so when the subject of the constitutional provision in question is the protection of a right.

 Constitutional rights are of en phrased as principles. T ey contain "majestic generalities." 15 T ey ref ect national ideals seeking maximum realization. T e synthesis of those ideals creates the purpose underlying all constitutional rights. But, if those ideals set its purpose, the language of the constitutional provision sets its interpretive limits. Constitutional language should not be interpreted in a manner that the text itself cannot tolerate. As noted in one case:

> T e interpreter approaches an existing text, to which he gives meaning. He cannot create a new text. T e interpreter cannot provide the text with an interpretive meaning that the text cannot tolerate. T e limit of legal interpretation is the limit of the legal text, and the limit of that text is determined by the specif c linguistic rules of that particular language … T us, the interpretive process ends where the language ends … Every meaning provided by the interpreter must f nd an Archimedean anchor in the text itself … T e text is not everything; we thus begin with the text but that does not conclude the interpretive process. Alongside the text, we examine the purpose. T at purpose however, cannot be obtained unless it can be fulf lled by the text. T e text, therefore, is always the framework within which the interpreter has to operate, and from which he may not depart … T e limits of the interpretative process lie with the text. 16

T e text of a constitutional provision, which includes a principle-shaped norm cannot tolerate just any content. A constitution is not a metaphor. T e constitutional text is not a non-binding recommendation. 17 It is not like clay in the sculptor's hands. T e idea of constitutional amendments through judicial interpretation – rather than through the mechanisms set by the constitution itself – is merely a metaphor. 18

 **b. Explicit and implicit constitutional text** T e term "constitutional text" entails both the constitution's explicit and implicit texts. 19 A constitutional text is explicit whenever its meaning may be conveyed through a dictionary def nition of the text placed against the relevant legal context

<sup>15</sup> Fay v. New York , 332 US 261, 282 (1947) (Jackson, J.). 16 HCJ 2257/04 Chadash-Ta'al Party v. Chairman of Knesset Election Committee Knesset

<sup>[2004]</sup> IsrSC 58(6) 685, 703–701 (Barak, P.). 17 See F. Schauer, "An Essay on Constitutional Language," 29 UCLA L. Rev . 797, 830 ( 1981 ). 18 See S. Levinson (ed.), Responding to Imperfection – T e T eory and Practice of Constitutional Amendment (Princeton University Press, 1995 ). 19 See Barak, above note 3, at 104.

(both internal and external). 20 T e implicit constitutional text, in contrast, is written with "invisible ink." It can be found "between the (constitutional) lines." 21 Take, for example, a constitution that includes chapters on both governmental powers and constitutional rights. T at same constitution does not contain an explicit provision relating to separation of powers, the rule of law, or the independence of the judiciary. Despite the lack of such explicit provisions, one may persuasively argue that this constitution implicitly includes the principles of separation of powers, the rule of law, and judicial independence. 22

T e meaning of the constitutional text, therefore, includes the meaning of both its explicit and implicit portions. T e implicit portion constitutes a part of the entire universe of the text, and should be treated the same as any other part of the explicit portion of the text. 23 Reasonable commentators and judges may dif er as to the proper boundaries of implicit text. Take, for example, the following hypothetical. A constitution contains several electoral provisions expressing the principles of democratic and equal (i.e., based on the principle of one-person-one-vote) national elections. Does this constitution also imply a constitutional right to political freedom of expression? T e High Court of Australia 24 answered this question in the positive. 25 T e constitutional text does indeed speak to us both explicitly and implicitly. In a conf ict between the explicit and the implicit portions of the constitutional text, the explicit text should always prevail. More accurately, when a certain constitutional matter can be addressed by an explicit constitutional text, there is no room to infer an implicit conf icting constitutional text.

T e distinction between explicit and implicit texts should not be confused with the distinction between the core of the constitutional right and its penumbra. Both the right's core and its penumbra constitute part of the constitutional right, regardless of whether this has been established by the explicit text or deduced from the implicit part. T e dif erence

between core and penumbra is not related to the content of the right or its scope; rather, it relates to the notion of the extent of the right's protection, or legal realization. T erefore, the correct analytical stage in which to distinguish between core and penumbra is when applying the rules of proportionality and not during the f rst constitutional stage – the analysis of the right's scope.

**c. Explicit constitutional text: parent and child rights** A constitutional right formed by explicit language as a principle is a "framing right." 26 It contains a bundle of rights. 27 In one of the cases, this kind of right was dubbed a "mother" right." 28 In order to determine the scope of matters where such parent (mother) right applies, an interpretive derivation is required. T e result of such a derivation would be a series of "particular" rights, or – as I have named them – "daughter rights" 29 (or children rights). T ese are rights derived from the explicit text of the constitution as interpreted by its constitutional purpose. T ey provide a concretization of the parent rights framework. T is concretization can be analyzed at several levels of abstraction. At the end of the interpretive process the judge arrives at a set of rules determining those concrete situations in which the constitutional right applies. 30

 It should be reemphasized that these child rights, which are derived from their parental constitutional rights, should also be considered a part of the explicit constitutional text. Remember that the process of arriving at such rights is that of constitutional interpretation. Accordingly, child rights are not implicit rights. T ey are explicit constitutional rights. By deriving them from their parental rights through interpretation we do

- I refer to the mother rights as parent rights, and the daughter rights as child rights. 29 Ibid . 30 Ibid ("T e right to human dignity is, in its nature, a 'framing' or a 'mother' right. A central feature of such a right is that, according to its language, it does not specify the particular situations to which it applies. It has an 'open' application … T e situations, to which it applies, therefore, may be deduced from interpreting the open-textured language of the Basic Law according to its constitutional purpose. T ese situations may, for convenience purposes, be classif ed in dif erent categories or groups. Such categories may include the right to decent human living conditions; the right to completeness of body and mind; the right to good reputation; the right (of an adult) to adopt; and many other 'daughter' rights

not f ll a gap (or "lacuna") in the constitutional text, 31 but rather, consider them to be part and parcel of the explicit constitutional text itself.

 Alexy draws a distinction between constitutional rights whose scope can be directly deduced from the constitutional text and derivative constitutional rights, whose scope cannot be deduced directly from the constitution, although they are necessary in the application of the constitutional norm. T e latter, indirectly deduced rights are what Alexy refers to as "clarifying rights." 32 For example, the German Constitution explicitly states that "research … shall be free." 33 From this general provision we can derive the more concrete right wherein a researcher has a right against any state inf uence in the receipt or conveying of scientif c information. 34 According to this understanding, the daughter rights are derivative rights.

T e distinction between direct and clarifying application, however, is not always easy to apply. Both the direct and clarifying application are applications stemming from the interpretive process applied to the explicit text of the constitution. In fact, the only possible realization of any parent constitutional right is through its child rights, whether this realization is deduced directly or indirectly (through clarif cation). T erefore, the parent right cannot apply to a concrete matter without the interpretive process – either conscious or sub-conscious – of deriving child – or even grand-child – rights in a descending level of abstraction, until the point has been reached where a constitutional rule applies to the specif c matter at hand. Take the Israeli constitutional parent right to human dignity. At f rst glance, the right to human dignity does not name the specif c situations to which it applies. Naturally, there are situations in which we can safely assume that "direct" interpretation will suf ce, such as in the case of preventing personal humiliation. But we can also argue that

that may be derived from the 'mother' right … Of course, determining the exact scope of the daughter rights may raise serious interpretive dif culties. As long as these rights were not separated by the constitutional assembly from the right to human dignity and therefore stand on their own, there is no escape from deriving them through an interpretive process. Such an interpretive process is focused on the parent (mother) right of human dignity while attempting to determine the right's scope, derives several categories of situations from it. Such categorization would never exhaust the list of instances on which the parent (mother) right applies, and it is not meant to do so. All it attempts to do is to assist

this personal humiliation is governed not directly by the general parent right to human dignity, but rather by the more concrete constitutional right – a "child" right – to be protected from personal humiliation. Such a child right may beget additional ("grand-child") rights, until a constitutional rule is formed that directly applies to the specif c matter at hand. In principle, there is no dif erence between cases in which the child right is deduced directly from the parent right and those in which it is learned by way of clarif cation. Both child rights are well included within the scope of their parent right; both are deduced by the same interpretive process.

 **d. Explicit constitutional text: named and enumerated rights** T e parent right has an explicit name. Human dignity, property, liberty, privacy – are all titles explicitly provided by many constitutions to def ne several constitutional rights. What is the proper name, however, of a child right? T e constitutional text provides a name to the "framing" or parent right. It provides no such name to child rights; indeed, they should not be given a name as they are part and parcel of their parent rights. T eir name is the same as their parent's. T e fact that they have no name of their own, however, does not mean that they are not a part of the explicit constitutional text. T ey are not "unwritten" rights. T ey are not rights without an explicit constitutional reference. T eir text is the text of the parent right. From the text's standpoint, they enjoy the same status as their parent right. T ey are enumerated rights. 35 T e right has no specif c name; yet it is still enumerated in the constitutional text. It is not an implicit right. It is an inseparable part of the parent right.

**e. Implicit constitutional text** In addition to the explicit text, there is implicit constitutional text. 36 Whatever is implied by the constitutional text is a part of the constitution no less than what is stated explicitly by it. T e implied part is written into the constitution, though it is written in invisible ink. It is not written "within" the lines of the constitutional text but "between" those lines. T e implicit parts of the constitution can

be learned from the text, its structure, 37 and its internal architecture. 38 As Tribe has correctly noted:

> T e Constitution's "structure" is (borrowing Wittgenstein's famous distinction) that which the text shows but does not directly say . Diction, word repetitions, and documentary organizing form (e.g., the division of the text into articles, or the separate status of the preamble and the amendments), for example, all contribute to a sense of what the constitution is about, that is as obviously "constitutional" as are the Constitution's words as such. 39

### In similar spirit, I wrote in one case:

T e meaning of a legal text cannot be solely deduced from its explicit portion. Rather, it also includes its implicit part. At times, that meaning can be determined by a single provision. T us, for example, an explicit text relating to a positive result in one situation may lead to an interpretive negative conclusion in an opposite case, even though that opposite case was not covered explicitly by the provision. T is kind of deduction may be achieved by looking at the text's entire structure and the totality of its provisions. For example, [in the Israeli legal system] we may f nd an implicit recognition of the principles of separation of powers, rule of law, and independent judiciary. T e language of the constitutional text is not limited to words whose meaning may be found in a dictionary. T e language of the text … must also include its implied part, its structure, its organization, and the relationship between its provisions … It may be argued that the implicit language of the text is written between the lines of the text in invisible ink. 40

 Accordingly, constitutional provisions specifying the authority of each of the three branches – the legislative, executive, and judicial branch – as

well as the provisions relating to constitutional rights may imply the existence of the constitutional principles of the separation of powers and an independent judiciary. 41 Similarly, could the constitutional provisions relating to democratic government imply a constitutional right to political speech? As noted earlier, the High Court of Australia was of the opinion that they could. 42 In Canada, the Supreme Court had attempted to develop (before the Charter was adopted) an implied Bill of Rights, derived from the general structure of the constitution. Eventually this attempt proved unsuccessful. 43 In the United States, Justice Douglas ruled that several constitutional rights imply, in their penumbras, the constitutional right to privacy. 44 Indeed, the constitutional structure cannot add words to the existing text, but it can assist in providing meaning to what is written between the lines. 45 Tribe is right, therefore, to suggest that the constitution is not merely its explicit language, but also "the spaces which structures f ll and whose patterns structures def ne." 46 He is also correct to note that alongside the visible constitution we can f nd "the invisible constitution." 47

 An important distinction should be drawn between implied constitutional language and a gap in the constitutional text. 48 Implied constitutional language is part of the existing text, although it is invisible. A gap in the constitutional text presupposes the absence of any relevant language – whether explicit or implicit – governing the issue. It assumes an incomplete constitutional structure aiming to be completed. A constitutional gap exists whenever the constitution has aimed at solving the issue at hand but ultimately failed to do so. A constitutional gap means an imperfection in the constitutional structure, in a way that contradicts its constitutional purpose. T e constitutional text may therefore be compared to a brick wall, where one (or more) of the bricks is missing. 49 T e gap's f lling is not done merely by an interpretive analysis of the existing constitutional text; rather, it requires, in addition, para-textual activity. "T e problem of interpretation is to supply a meaning to the norm; that of lacunae is to supply the norm." 50 In interpretation, the judge gives meaning to an existing, explicit or implicit text that was created by others. In f lling a gap, judges themselves create text (according to criteria set by law). T ese kinds of actions are familiar to several European legal systems regarding the notion of f lling statutory gaps. 51

 An interesting question is whether the idea of a gap and its judicial f lling applies to constitutions as well. Could one say that, in some cases, when the constitution is "silent" on a particular issue, it also creates a constitutional gap? Assuming that is the case, are judges allowed to f ll such a gap? Can the Australian High Court's decisions on the implied constitutional right to political speech serve as a judicial example of a constitutional gap-f lling in the area of constitutional rights? Does Justice Douglas' ruling – acknowledging the existence of a constitutional right to privacy as created by the penumbra of other explicit constitutional rights – open the door to constitutional gap-f lling by the American courts?

T e Supreme Court of Switzerland was prepared to recognize a judicial role in constitutional gap-f lling. 52 T e court determined that new constitutional rights can be recognized by the court whenever these rights constitute a vital component of a democracy governed by the rule of law, or in areas where those rights were required as preconditions to the realization of other explicit constitutional rights. 53 Accordingly, the Swiss Supreme Court recognized the constitutional rights to property, life and liberty, as well as the constitutional freedom of expression and assembly.

 Importantly, constitutional gaps should never be used as the f rst option. T ey do not apply, for example, where the legal issue may otherwise be resolved through the interpretation of the constitutional text (explicit or implicit). T us, the judicial recognition of child rights 54 does not constitute a gap-f lling activity, as these rights derive their content from the explicit language of a constitutional right. Accordingly, the Australian High Court decision recognizing the right to political freedom of expression should not be considered a gap-f lling activity to the extent that such recognition was based on the implicit meaning of the existing constitutional text. Note that the distinction between explicit and implicit meaning on the one hand and the f lling of a constitutional gap on the other is extremely important, for two reasons. First, providing meaning to a constitutional text – either explicit or implicit – falls well within the legitimate judicial activity of legal interpretation. Conversely, f lling a constitutional gap does not fall within the purview of legal interpretation; as a result, it requires a special, separate source of legitimacy. Such a source does not currently exist in many of the Western legal systems. 55 Second, providing meaning to the text of a constitutional human right – either explicit or implicit – is done in accordance with the specif c rules of legal

interpretation that apply to each legal system. T e rules for f lling a constitutional gap, in contrast, are para-interpretational. Each legal system that recognizes the judicial role of constitutional gap-f lling is also required to produce a set of para-interpretational rules for that purpose. At the center of those rules is the notion of legal analogy (to the existing text of the constitutional rights), and, in cases where such analogy is unavailable, reference to the system's basic legal values. 56

### iv. Constitutional purpose

**a. Te nature of constitutional purpose** T e process of purposive constitutional interpretation requires all available interpretive data – relating to either the subjective or the objective purpose of the constitutional text – to be examined at the same time. 57 T ere are no "stages" in the consideration of the "subjective" set of data and the "objective" set. Both are considered at the same time.

 To begin, a constitutional text cannot be properly understood without taking into account the intent of its creators; 58 similarly, a constitutional text cannot be properly understood without considering its original understanding. Yet, the ultimate meaning of the constitutional text – while af ected by both subjective and original understanding of the text – cannot be dominated by either. A vital component of the purpose of the constitutional text is its objective purpose. Purposive constitutional interpretation seeks to create a synthesis between the subjective and the objective data regarding the constitutional purpose. 59 T e interpretive process does not call for a confrontation between the two sets of data, but rather to harmonize them.

 What, then, should the interpreter do when the two sets of data do not align, when the subjective purpose points to one interpretative direction while the objective to another? According to purposive constitutional interpretation, in cases of a conf ict between the two, the objective purpose – the understanding of the text at the time the interpretation is conducted – should prevail. 60 In other words, the objective purpose should be given more weight while balancing both sets of data. Only in that way can the constitution fulf ll its most crucial social functions – the direction of

human behavior across generations of social change, and the provision of legal solutions to modern, evolving needs. T e constitution must do all that, while properly balancing the past, the present, and the future of the society it governs. Indeed, the past may signif cantly af ect the present, yet it should not determine it. T e past may ef ectively direct the present, yet it should not enslave it. T e basic concepts of society – which stem from the past and are intertwined in the legal and social history of a nation – should f nd their modern expression in the original constitutional text. 61

 Both the subjective purpose and the original understanding should be considered, though not be attributed a controlling weight, during the interpretation of the constitutional text. 62T is approach, considering past interpretations, while not according them a central interpretive role, is well accepted by many of the Western legal systems. T is, for example, is

61 See W. Brennan, "Construing the Constitution," 19 UC Davis L. Rev . 2, 7 ( 1985 ) ("We current Justices read the Constitution in the only way that we can: as Twentieth Century Americans. We look to the history of the time of framing and to the intervening history of interpretation. But the ultimate question must be, what do the words of the text mean in our time? For the genius of the Constitution rests not in any static meaning it might have had in a world that is dead and gone, but in the adaptability of its great principles to cope with current problems and current needs. What the constitutional fundamentals meant to the wisdom of other times cannot be their measure to the vision of our times. Similarly, what those fundamentals mean for us, our descendants will learn, cannot be the measure to the vision of their time."); see also M. Kirby, "Constitutional Interpretation and Original Intent: A Form of Ancestor Worship," 24 Melb. U. L. Rev . 1, 14 (2000) ("[I]n the kind of democracy which a constitution such as ours establishes, judges should make their choices by giving meaning to the words in a way that protects and advances the essential character of the polity established by the constitution. In Australia, this function is to be performed without the need constantly to look over one's shoulder and to refer to understandings of the text that were common in 1900 when the society which the Constitution addresses was so dif erent. It is today's understanding that counts. Reference to 1900, if made at all, should be in the minor key and largely for historical interest. Not for establishing legal limitations. In my opinion, a consistent application of the view that the Constitution was set free from its founders in 1900 is the rule that we should apply. T at our Constitution belongs to succeeding generations of the Australian people. T at is bound to be read in changing ways as time passes and circumstances change. T at it should be read so as to achieve the purposes of good government which the Constitution was designed to promote and secure. Our Constitution belongs to the 21st century, not to the 19th."); M.

Had this not been done, our Constitution would have remained an instrument for giving ef ect to no more than the aspirations of rich white males of the nineteenth century. Fortunately, we have done better than this."); Re Wakin (1993) 73 ALJR 839, 878. See also B. Wilson, "Decision-Making in the Supreme Court," 36 U. Toronto L. J . 227, 247 ( 1986 ). 62 See Barak, above note 3, at 386.

the approach adopted in Canada. T e Canadian Supreme Court grants little interpretive weight to either the constitution's original understanding or to its framers' intentions. 63 In one case, the Court examined section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which provides:

> Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice . 64

T e issue was whether the notion of "fundamental justice" appearing in the constitutional text should be read as a procedural requirement or of substantial nature. One of the arguments in favor of the procedural aspect was that when the Charter was adopted this was the draf ers' original intention. It was further demonstrated that the draf ers deliberately chose to refrain from using the American term "due process," given the controversy surrounding it. In order to avoid such controversies and to assure the procedural – rather than the substantive – nature of the Canadian term, the draf ers opted for an entirely new expression. And yet, the Canadian Supreme Court has decided to accord little weight to this subjective purpose. As Justice Lamer explained:

> Another danger with casting the interpretation of S. 7 in terms of the comments made by those heard at the Special Joint Committee Proceedings is that, in so doing, the rights, freedoms, and values embodied in the Charter in ef ect become frozen in time to the moment of adoption with little or no possibility of growth, development and adjustment to changing social needs. If the newly planted "living tree" which is the Charter is to have the possibility of growth and adjustment over time, care must be taken to ensure that historical materials … do not stunt its growth. 65

 A similar approach was expressed by the Australian High Court. 66 T at court emphasized that it should not accord dispositive weight to the "dead

(1995) 182 CLR 104, 106 ("[E]ven if it could be established that it was the unexpressed intention of the framers of the Constitution that the failure to follow the United States model should preclude or impede the implication of constitutional rights, their intention in that regard would be simply irrelevant to the construction of provisions whose legitimacy lay in their acceptance by the people. Moreover, to construe the Constitution on the basis that the dead hands of those who

hands" of the framers, who attempt to control the meaning of the constitution from their graves. T is is also the approach adopted by the German Constitutional Court. In one case, the court examined the question of whether a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without parole violates the constitutional right to human dignity. T e court decided it does. It concluded that inmates should have at least a trace of hope for a better future, and that to eliminate such hope would be unconstitutional. It was argued that the framers' intention was to preserve mandatory life sentences without parole, and that this punishment was intended as a replacement of the death penalty. T e court rejected this "subjective" interpretation. T e court explained:

> Neither original understanding nor the ideas and intentions of the framers are of decisive importance in interpreting particular provisions of the Basic Law. Since the adoption of the Basic Law, our understanding of the content, function, and ef ect of basic rights has deepened. Additionally, the medical, psychological, and sociological ef ects of life imprisonment have become better known. Current attitudes are important in assessing the constitutionality of the imprisonment. New insights can inf uence and even change the evaluation of this punishment in terms of human dignity and the principles of a constitutional state. 67

 Summarizing the accepted interpretive approach in Germany, Professor Kommers explains:

> [I]n Germany, original history – that is, the intentions of the framers – is seldom dispositive in resolving the meaning of the Basic Law. T e court has declared that "the original history of a particular provision of the Basic Law has no decisive importance in constitutional interpretation." Original history performs, at best, the auxiliary function of landing support to a result already arrived at by other interpretive methods. When there is a conf ict, however, arguments based on text, structure, or teleology will prevail over those based on history. 68

 In these legal systems – Canada, Australia, Israel and Germany – neither the original understanding, nor the intent of the framers, occupies a central role in judicial consideration of constitutional interpretation. 69 Of course, neither is ignored; but they remain far from being the discussion's focal point.

T is approach was not adopted in the United States. T ere is hardly a consensus regarding the proper weight to be accorded to past interpretations. Instead, in the United States, the competing notions of original intent of the founding fathers (also known as "intentionalism"), the original understanding of the terms used in the Constitution ("originalism"), and the "living constitution" 70 are all sources of an ongoing debate in academic writing and on the bench. 71 Indeed, the United States Supreme Court itself is – and has been for years – divided on this issue. 72 T e entire corpus of American constitutional law f nds itself in a state of crisis due

to this lack of consensus. Without accord in the legal community about the proper role that original intent, original understanding, and current notions of constitutional interpretation should play in determining the meaning of constitutional provisions today, the entire constitutional system is hanging in the balance. 73 A crisis of this sort has been avoided in Canada, Australia, Germany and Israel. Hopefully, other constitutional legal systems will successfully avoid this dangerous situation, which may tear apart the legal system as well as focus all legal energy on the crisis.

 According to the purposive constitutional interpretation approach, the intent of the framers or the original understanding should not be ignored; however, they should not be of higher status. 74 It is the objective – rather than the subjective – purpose that should be accorded most of the interpretive weight. T e objective purpose properly ref ects the basic modern notions of the legal system as it moves across history. T is is how a constitution turns into a living document rather than remains stagnant parchment. T is is how the present is not subjugated by the past. Indeed, constitutional interpretation is the process in which every generation expresses its own basic concepts as they were shaped against the nation's historical background. 75T is process is not limitless; it is not open-ended. T e interpreter, providing meaning to the constitutional text, must work within a given social and historical framework. And, although the judge is sometimes accorded judicial discretion by the system, this discretion

purpose. T e very objective of a basic law, it seems to me, is to place certain matters beyond risk of change, except through the extraordinary democratic majorities that constitutional amendment requires … T e whole purpose of a constitution – old or new – is

- to impede change, or, pejoratively put, to 'abstract modernity.'" 73 T at includes the approach of the founding fathers themselves, who wanted the Constitution to be interpreted according to its objective purpose. See, e.g., J. Powell, "T e Original Understanding of Original Intent," 98 Harv. L. Rev . 885 ( 1985 ); R. Clinton, "Original Understanding, Legal Realism, and the Interpretation of 'T is Constitution'," 72 Iowa L. Rev . 1177 ( 1987 ); C. A.

is bounded by a limited set of values, traditions, history, and text that are unique to the system in which he operates. Indeed, the process of eliciting a constitutional purpose is based on fundamental concepts that seek to create a strong link to the constitutional past and grant it its due weight. T e interpreter does not disconnect from the system's constitutional history. And, while the ultimate modern constitutional purpose is objective, its roots lie far in the constitutional past. "T e constitutional provision was not legislated in a constitutional vacuum and does not develop in a constitutional incubator. Rather, it is a part of life." 76

**b. Constitutional purpose and the protection of constitutional rights** T ere are those – such as Justice Scalia 77 – who argue that providing a modern meaning to the constitutional text contradicts one of the constitution's main functions, namely, the protection of individuals from the majority. According to this view, should the constitution be interpreted in accordance with current views it would only ref ect the current majority's concept of what is right. T ese views, in turn, will af ect individual rights that the majority seeks to limit. Accordingly, the constitution should be interpreted only in light of its original understanding in order to prevent such results. T e response to this argument is that a current understanding of constitutional rights does not entail an adoption of the current majority's views on what is right. T e process of the purposive interpretation of constitutional rights considers the most fundamental values of any given society, which ref ect its long-standing views rather than its current, transient fads. At times, the judge may f nd it hard to disregard society's current trends and to continue ref ecting on these fundamental views. At times, it will be harder to rely on wellestablished notions of history rather than to abide by current notions of public hysteria. Still, judges must perform their task, and indeed have been performing this task ever since the establishment of constitutional democracies. Judges will continue to do so while attempting to interpret their own constitutions. According to this interpretive process, each constitutional right should be accorded the same scope that best ref ects the reasons justifying it. T ese reasons, in turn, ref ect the legal system's movement across time well.

### v. "Living constitution" and "living tree"

 One of the constitution's main functions is to enable each society to successfully confront its changing circumstances over time. When the constitution was f rst constituted, its framers sought to lay a foundation for a document that would govern society for generations to come. So as not to become tyrannical, however, this legal document also contains f exible mechanisms for future developments. T is is the meaning of the metaphor about "a living constitution." T e "life" of the constitution is not solely made up of the application of its old principles to new cases; 78 rather, the constitution's "life" also means pouring new content into old constitutional principles. 79 For the same reasons, the metaphor of "a living tree" is used in Canada. 80 But the image of a living tree also points to the metaphor's limitations: T e "livelihood" of basic constitutional values is not an open invitation for the judge to change them at will. T e subjective will of the constitution's creators should not be replaced by the subjective will of its interpreters. Rather, the changing content of constitutional values should ref ect a change in the basic concepts of the society regarding its national creed. T ese changes ref ect the history, tradition, and shared faith of each nation. T ey are not – and should not be considered as – an expression of the judge's personal ideas.

Another example is the inf uence the Canadian Charter has had on the constitutional law of South Africa. See, e.g., J. de Waal, "A Comparative Analysis of the Provisions of German Origin in the Interim Bill of Rights," 11 SAJHR 1 ( 1995 ); P. W.

shared democratic values. 86 Even in the absence of such shared reference, an interpretive inf uence is still available through the study of comparative constitutional law. However, such comparative inspiration should occur only when the two systems share an ideological framework and loyalty to the same basic constitutional values. 87 Similarly, the two systems should be examined in order to reveal any distinct historical or social factors that may render interpretational inspiration untenable. 88 However, when such limitations do not exist and a common constitutional basis is shared, a comparative-law interpretive inspiration may be helpful – whether the comparative source is another legal system or international law itself. Indeed, many international treaties contain well-established constitutional values and thus may prove helpful in the understanding of a particular constitutional text. Further, the rulings of international and

T e manner in which these legal systems treat many constitutional issues, including human rights, has been a major source of inspiration. With that, this type of learning should be controlled.

In that case, I refused (in dissent) to accept constitutional interpretive guidance regarding the authority to provide a pre-trial pardon from either the authorities given to the English Crown or to the American President.

(Scalia, J.)). While I agree with Justice Scalia that the f nal decision should be "American" in nature, I also agree with the dissent that, in the process of making that decision, a comparative interpretational inspiration may be of assistance – especially with countries whose treatment of constitutional human rights in general and the sanctity of human life in particular is quite similar to that of the United States.

local courts – interpreting those treaties – may provide guidance in the interpretation of a national constitutional text. In some cases, the constitution itself includes a provision incorporating – or allowing for the consideration of – comparative legal sources. 89

 It should be noted, however, that the rulings of foreign courts are never binding. 90 In fact, they are not even a "persuasive" source. T eir authority should therefore not be compared to that of a Supreme Court ruling, which in most legal systems does not bind the Supreme Court itself. Indeed, the proper status of comparative legal materials is similar to that of a good book on the subject or a leading law-review article. T us, the weight is determined more by the content of its discussion, than by an of cial measure. 91

To the extent that regulation in both systems is based upon shared basic assumptions, comparative inspiration may be of great value. Such comparison invigorates constitutional thinking and provides new theoretical horizons. It points to the potential that hides in the constitutional text; it sheds light on the legal arrangements practiced in other countries. It provides a mirror through which we can view ourselves in a clearer, brighter light. Indeed, the examination of comparative law provides the judge with conf dence, in the sense that the solution he may provide has already been tried and tested in other places. With that, such comparative inspiration should not turn into automatic adaptation. T e f nal decision is always 'domestic.' Further, comparative law has its own limitations. T e legal system of each democracy ref ects much of its society's attributes; ours are dif erent from others. T e weight of authority given by each legal system to certain considerations ref ects its culture, its history, and its values – and these vary from one nation to another. Particular regulative arrangements of en ref ect local balances of power, or try to provide an answer to a specif c, local issue.

rif within the American legal system. 92 T ere, the "originalist" camp – supporting the notion that the original understanding should govern the interpretation of the constitutional text – strenuously opposes the idea of considering any comparative or foreign law not part of such understanding. 93 Despite that, the pattern in American law seems to have moved in the direction of more openness towards foreign and comparative law. 94 It is hoped the Court will proceed in this direction. 95

### 2. Constitutional interpretation: a generous view

### i. Constitutional interpretation: generous, not expanding

 A constitutional provision should be interpreted generously, 96 from a "substantive" rather than a "legalistic" approach, from a merit-based rather than a "technical" or "pedantic" approach. 97 Even generous interpretation is still bound by the contours of the constitutional text. 98 Generous interpretation does not entail an interpretive result. However, generous interpretation may lead to either an expansive or a narrow interpretive result. T is is necessary, as what constitutes an "expansive interpretation" of one constitutional provision may lead to a "limited interpretation" of another.

### 70 Constitutional rights: scope and limitations

### ii. Harmony-enhancing constitutional interpretation

 Generous constitutional interpretation should provide a meaning that, more than any other, realizes the purpose of the constitutional text. T is purpose ref ects historical continuity and the modern fundamental constitutional concepts. It should achieve unity and constitutional harmony. 99 Further, generous interpretation is not solely limited to the meaning of the words in the historical-linguistic context in which they were created. Rather, it provides the constitution's language with a meaning ref ecting both the historical context and the modern fundamental constitutional concepts. 100

### iii. Generous interpretation of the constitutional right

T e language of the constitutional text protecting rights should be interpreted according to its purpose from a generous point of view. T erefore, the text should be interpreted in a way that realizes the reasons underlying

T at structure is founded on each legal system's basic notions of law and society. Accordingly, the role of the judgeinterpreter, while approaching a constitutional provision, is to create harmony between that provision and the foundations of constitutional law already existing in that system."); HCJ 4676/94 Meatrael v. T e Israeli Knesset PD 50 (5) 15, 29 (1996) ("A proper interpretive concept regarding constitutional arrangements – even if they exist in separate documents – should always aspire towards constitutional unity. A constitutional norm does not stand on its own. It is always a part of a constitutional edif ce. It is but one brick of an entire constitutional structure … Each constitutional provision af ects its constitutional surroundings. T us, to interpret one constitutional provision is to interpret the entire constitutional framework. A single constitutional provision af ects the understanding of the entire constitutional edif ce, and that constitutional edif ce, in turn, af ects the understanding of the single provision … Constitutional interpretation, therefore, should aspire to a result by which all the constitutional provisions – even when they are spread across several documents – should be integrated in a way providing constitutional harmony and systematic unity." (Barak, P.)). See also German Constitutional Court, BVerfGE 14, 32 ("A specif c constitutional provision cannot be interpreted as a sole provision, unrelated to other constitutional provisions. T e constitution contains an internal unity, and the understanding of each part directly relates to the understanding of other portions.

United States , 233 US 604, 610 (1914) ("T e provisions of the Constitution are not mathematical formulas having their essence in their form, they are organic living institutions transplanted from English soil.

the right itself. It should ref ect the full scope of the ideals that a particular right is seeking to achieve within a given society. 101 It should ref ect the moral considerations underlying the right. T ese reasons change from time to time, and from one legal system to another. T e interpretation of the constitutional text protecting a constitutional right should not include, as per its proper interpretation, tenuously related issues not ref ecting the reasons for which it was made. Accordingly, for example, the right to freedom of expression should not be interpreted as including the right to commit perjury, or the right to issue threats, or the right to freedom of contract. 102 Rather, such interpretation should ref ect the spectrum of reasons underlying the right's creation. For that reason, the right's scope should not be limited through interpretation merely due to public interest considerations, 103 or the rights of others. 104 T ese considerations should be taken into account in the second stage of the constitutional review. No such balancing should be conducted at the f rst stage. 105 For the same reasons, the right's scope should not be narrowed solely because the case at hand involves an "abuse of rights." 106 Even an abuse of rights presupposes the existence of the right itself, and that very existence should determine the right's scope. Of course, the abuse should be considered and will probably have consequences at a later stage, but has no place during the determination of the right's scope. T e abuse is to be considered during the discussion of the extent of the right's protection and of its realization.

### iv. T e relationship between the interpretation of the right and the interpretation of the limitation

 According to a view found in the literature, the broad interpretation of a constitutional right should lead to the broad interpretation of the rules of proportionality contained in the limitation clause; narrow interpretation of the right, in turn, should lead to narrow interpretation of the rules of proportionality. 107 According to this view, once the right has been

interpreted broadly, the limitation should also receive a broad interpretation; similarly, once the right has been interpreted narrowly, the limitation should be interpreted narrowly. Another view argues for a broad interpretation of the right coupled with a narrow interpretation of its limitation. 108 A possible third view – for which no support was found – may advocate for a narrow interpretation of the right and a broad interpretation of the limitation.

 None of these views can be supported. Both the constitutional rights and the proportionality found in the limitation clause should receive neither "narrow" nor "broad" interpretation. Rather, both should undergo the process of purposive interpretation. Such interpretation would enable the right to receive its due scope in accordance with its underlying reasons. Similarly, it would enable the limitation clause – and the elements of proportionality included therein – to be attributed its due interpretive scope in accordance with the same factors.

### v. Interpretive balancing

**a. Te nature of the interpretive balancing** Generous interpretation may be exercised at dif erent levels of abstraction. 109 At the most abstract level, it seeks to provide the constitutional text with the meaning which, more than any other, realizes the basic principles of the legal system in which the text was created. 110 At this level of abstraction, all legal texts share a similar purpose. T is purpose may be referred to as the "normative umbrella" covering all legal texts that exist in a single legal universe. T ese are the very foundations on which the entire legal structure is built. 111 At the sub-constitutional level, whenever we examine a statutory provision, we observe that every legislative act is like "a creature living within its environment." 112 T at legal environment contains not only the nearest statutory provisions, but rather "widening co-centric circles of accepted principles, shared basic purposes, and fundamental legal criteria." 113 T e same should apply to constitutional provisions. T e

constitution is enveloped by principles that ref ect the nation's fundamental concepts, 114 as well as society's most entrenched values. 115T ey contain an expression of the national ethos, the cultural heritage, the social tradition, and the entire historical experience of that nation.116 In some cases, these principles are mentioned explicitly in the constitution. 117 In other cases, these principles are gleaned from sources external to the constitutional text. 118 T ese principles "envelop" the constitution and, in each case, "must be studied in light of that people's national way of life." 119 T e dif erent principles are of en in a constant state of conf ict. T at conf ict is resolved through the act of balancing. 120 T is notion relates to the balancing of the conf icting basic principles while granting each their relative "weight" in the legal system ref ecting their social importance. Over the last several decades, for example, the Israeli Supreme Court has dealt extensively with the notion of balancing conf icting principles. T is judicial balancing was used, prior to the adoption of the judicial review of legislation, to assess the proper scope of executive power. T e People's Voice121 case demonstrates the potential of such use well. At issue was a provision of the 1933 Press Ordinance (enacted by the British during their mandate and still in ef ect at the time of the trial). According to that provision, the Minister of the Interior was authorized to shut down a

newspaper – either temporarily or permanently – if, in his sole discretion, "certain matter appearing in such newspapers … [is] likely to endanger the public peace." 122T e daily People's Voice published an article critical of the Israeli government which was willing to send its troops to f ght alongside American forces in the Korean War. In particular, the article stated that "the Israeli government may send its soldiers to die merely to serve the interests of American imperialism," and that "these soldiers would serve as 'cannon fodder' for the American f ghting machine." Finally, the article claimed that "the majority of Israelis would not allow their leaders to trade with their sons' blood." Af er reading the piece, the Minister of the Interior decided to shut down the newspaper for several days. T e newspaper petitioned the Supreme Court. Since, at the time, the judicial review of legislation had yet to be adopted, the constitutionality of the provision was never at issue. Rather, the issue was interpretative in nature. Specif cally, the issue was the proper interpretation of a statutory provision allowing the Minister to shut down a newspaper. Within that provision, the court had to determine the specif c causal connection between the notion of "likelihood" which is required to shut down the newspaper and the notion of "danger to the public peace." Justice Agranat held that the causal connection required by the provision should represent a proper balancing between the need to guarantee the public peace on the one hand, and the need to guarantee the right to freedom of speech on the other. T e court then proceeded to conduct such a balancing, and concluded that the causal connection most f tting is that of "near certainty." In other words, the Minister can shut down a newspaper if (and only if), there was "near certainty" that a published piece would lead to the "endangerment of the public peace." 123

T e court did not use the balancing tool to determine the constitutionality of the statutory provision; rather, it used it to properly interpret the scope of executive authority as provided by a statutory provision. T rough the act of balancing the court could arrive at the purpose underlying the statutory provision, not its constitutionality. T e court used interpretive balancing. Following T e People's Voice , the Israeli Supreme Court used interpretive balancing numerous times to assess the contours of the executive authority found in dif erent statutory provisions. 124 Indeed, interpretive balancing may be used in every case that the purpose of the interpreted law is in question. Accordingly, interpretive balance should be applied to

<sup>122</sup> See Press Ordinance, Art. 19 (1933). 123 See above, at 73. 124 See A. Barak, "Human Rights in Israel," 39 Isr. L. Rev . 12 ( 2006 ).

the interpretation of any constitutional text, and in particular to the interpretation of a constitutional text relating to the protection of rights.

 **b. Interpretive balancing and constitutional balancing** Interpretive balancing determines the objective purpose of law such as statutes or a constitution. It does so by balancing the conf icting principles underlying each norm. T is balance is based upon the social importance ascribed to each conf icting principle. T e interpretive balancing is relevant for the interpretation of a text the purpose of which is conf icting principles – not for the determination of its constitutionality. When determining the components of interpretive balancing there is no application of all the elements of proportionality used for the determination of the justif cation of the limitation of the constitutional right. However, the interpretive balancing is based on balancing, and may, through analogy, use the element of proportionality stricto sensu in the rules of proportionality. 125

# **B. Te right'sscope and public interest**

### 1. T e proper role of public interest considerations

 When attempting to determine the proper scope of a constitutional right, should public interest considerations be included? Take, for example, the right to freedom of expression: when attempting to determine its scope, should the interpreter take into account public interest considerations such as the protection of national security interests, the prevention of the publication of obscenities, or the solicitation of hate speech? T e importance of these considerations is beyond dispute; but the issue here is when should they be considered? At what stage of the constitutional review? 126 T e answer is clear in those cases where the legal system is based on a single-stage model of judicial review. In those situations, public interest considerations are taken into account in the single stage of the constitutional review. 127 But what is the case when the legal system has adopted a two-stage model, such as in Germany, Canada, South Africa, and Israel? As explained in Chapter 1 , the two-stage model is based upon a distinction between the f rst stage of the constitutional review, where the scope

<sup>125</sup> See below, at 340. 126 On the stages of constitutional review, see above, at 26. 127 See R. H. Fallon, "Individual Rights and the Powers of Government," 27 Ga. L. Rev . 343, 361 (1993).

of the constitutional right is determined, and the second stage, where a determination is made as to the constitutionality of the justif cation of the limitations imposed on the right's realization. 128 Should public interest considerations be included in the f rst stage or the second or in both stages? Should public interest considerations af ect the determination of the right's scope, or should consideration of these interests be postponed to the stage of justif cation of the discussion of the limitations imposed on the right's realization – in other words, to the discussion regarding proportionality?

### 2. Public interest as part of proportionality

T e proper location for public interest considerations is in the second stage of the constitutional review, as part of the discussion of the justif cation of the limitation on the constitutional right. 129T us, public interest considerations should be included, and receive their due attention, within the discussion of the rules of proportionality. As part of these rules, and in particular within the elements of "purpose" and "proportionality stricto sensu ," public-interest considerations should be brought to bear. Accordingly, when a sub-constitutional law (such as statute or common law) attempts to limit the constitutional right to freedom of expression, public interest considerations should be included within the determination of the law's proportionality. In other words, they will be considered in the second stage of the constitutional review, determining the constitutionality of the limitations imposed on the right and its realization. Public interest considerations should not be included in the stage determining the scope of the constitutional right to freedom of expression itself. 130

T is is the approach of the German Constitutional Court which distinguishes between the elements constituting the right and the considerations applying to its limitations. Public interest considerations are not considered

T is approach provides a better understanding of the notion of the constitutional right. It places the constitutional right as an ideal sought to be realized by the society in which it resides. T is ideal may conf ict with other ideals – or other interests – sought to be realized by the same society. T is kind of conf ict should not be resolved, however, by narrowing the scope of the ideals, but rather by limiting the way they are realized. T e right itself, as a legal concept, should continue to exist in a pure form as an aspiration crossing dimensions of space and time. It should exist in a constant state of conf ict with other opposing aspirations. Such a conf ict is resolved through balancing at the sub-constitutional level. 135 Such balancing is governed by the rules of proportionality included in the limitation clause. T e balancing between the ways in which the constitutional right is realized and the opposing aspiration does not af ect or change the scope or the nature of the right itself. Rather, such balancing af ects the realization of the right at the sub-constitutional level in a given society at a given time. Such an approach always provides society with the ideals it should aspire to fulf ll, and strengthens the legal status of these ideals – even if they are never realized in practice. As such, the right's boundaries and powers are maintained even during catastrophes. Narrowing the means by which a right may be realized at any given time does not af ect the right itself. In addition, a clear distinction between a constitutional right on the one hand and the public interest on the other will lead to a better, mutually productive public and constitutional discourse. T e dividing lines between law and politics will prove clearer and more accurate. T e dif erent considerations

and not during the f rst stage, where the right's scope is being determined." (Barak, P.)). See also HCJ 10203/03 T e National Assembly Ltd . v. Attorney General (unreported decision of August 20, 2008), para. 21 ("As a general rule, when we discuss limitations upon the realization of a protected human right, the balancing act is conducted between that protected right and other values and public interests. T e same is true in this case, where the main justif cation for the limitation – or rather outright restriction – on political speech through paid advertisements is the doctrine of fairness. T e balancing in this case is 'external,' between a constitutional human right and conf icting public-interest considerations. In principle, such balancing should be conducted within the contours of the limitation clause. Another view may lead to over-narrowing of the internal scope of the right itself, as the way to realize that right may no longer be protected. In addition, such an approach may create an analytic and practical blurring of the line between the stage in which the internal scope of the right is def ned and the stage in which the proper amount of protection they deserve is determined, since the public-interest considerations that are weighed during the proper purpose stage will inf ltrate into the very def nition of the right. T at, in turn, may lead to a heavier burden on those petitioners seeking to claim that the right has been infringed upon, since the examination of these public considerations would be removed into the f rst stage." (Beinish, P.)). 135 See below, at 87.

will be presented clearly and most precisely, and the weight each is given will be evident – and thus easier to evaluate and criticize. 136

T is principled approach to the understanding of constitutional rights stems from the two-stage model. 137 T is analytical model is based on the distinction between the scope of the right on the one hand, and the ways in which it may be realized on the other. It allows for an examination of the entire scope of the right in the f rst stage of the constitutional review, while imposing proportional limitations on the right in the second, subconstitutional stage. It would be inappropriate and unfortunate if the same constitutional right would be af ected twice – once during the f rst stage, when the scope of the right is narrowed, and the second time during the second stage, when further limitations are imposed on this already limited constitutional right.

 One may critique this approach. First, it may be argued that this approach may lead to the undermining of the dignity of legislation, since every legislative act would ultimately infringe upon a constitutional right (so broadly def ned). If, indeed, every such infringement would need to be examined by the courts, what would remain of the legislative institution?

 It is agreed that human dignity should not displace legislative dignity. 138 T e dignity of legislation is dear to anyone who holds democracy and human rights dear. But no contradiction exists between a generous approach to constitutional rights and the dignity of the legislation, just as no contradiction exists between judicial review on the validity of a statute and the dignity of that statute. Respect for the legislator and to statutes is demonstrated through respect for provisions of the constitution. T e right relationship between the legislator and the judge is through constitutional dialogue rather than a monologue – either by the legislator or by the judge. 139

 Another argument is that this approach creates a burden on the second stage of the judicial review process (where the constitutionality of the limiting law is considered). T at, in turn, may lead to the dilution of the protection granted to constitutional rights. According to this argument, the desire to provide adequate protection to constitutional rights through a more powerful limitation clause may lead to a restrictive approach to the scope of the right. Such a restrictive approach could be manifested

<sup>136</sup> See below, at 87. 137 See above, at 26. 138 See J. Waldron, T e Dignity of Legislation (Cambridge University Press, 1999 ). 139 See generally A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006), 236–240.

through a consideration of the rights of other individuals as well as of the public interest. T is argument was made by Hogg in relation to the proper analysis of the Canadian limitation clause. 140 It seems that the fears of restrictive interpretation are not well founded. T ey are surely least founded whenever the proportionality tests promulgated by the limitation clause are carefully applied by the courts in each case, with a close examination of both the right's scope and its limitation.

 Finally, it can be argued that the approach described will open the litigation f oodgates, creating an overwhelming burden for the courts. T e factual premise to this argument is lacking. In any event, even if this should occur, the courts should, and will, f nd ways to properly respond to the new need. Restricting the scope of constitutional rights should not be the f rst option.

# **C. Te scope of constitutionalrights and the rights of others**

### 1. T e proper role of "rights of others" considerations

 We have discussed one type of consideration – relating to the public interest – that should be considered during the second stage. What about another group of considerations – those relating to the rights of others? Should these be considered a part of the right's scope in the f rst stage, or, like public interest considerations, examined during the second stage – that of the justif cations of the limitations? Take, for example, the right to freedom of expression. When determining this right's scope, should we take into account the right to privacy of others, or their right to enjoy a good reputation? Should such considerations limit the scope of the constitutional right to freedom of expression? T e answer to this question is no – much like the answer provided to the question about public interest considerations, and for the same reasons. According to this approach, the scope of a constitutional right is determined by its interpretation. It ref ects the underlying reasons of the right itself. It ref ects the societal ideal expressed within that right. Such a scope should not be narrowed due to considerations of other people's rights. 141 Accordingly, the scope of the right to freedom of expression should not be narrowed due to considerations of other people's right to privacy or to enjoy a good reputation.

<sup>140</sup> See P. W. Hogg, "Interpreting the Charter of Rights: Generosity and Justif cation," 28 Osgoode Hall L. J . 817 ( 1990 ). 141 See HCJ 1435/03, Jane Doe . v. Disciplinary Ct. for Gov't Employees in Haifa [2003] IsrSC

<sup>58(1) 529, 537 (</sup>Barak, P.). See below, at 87.

T erefore, a constitutional right to freedom of expression should include expressions that may be hurtful to other people's reputation, or even af ect their privacy. T ese considerations, relating to the rights of others, are extremely important. T ey should not be ignored. T ey should be taken into account. T e stage of reviewing such considerations, however, should not be within the determination of the right's scope; rather within the discussion of the possibilities of its realization. It should thus be a part of the second stage of the constitutional review. Such considerations constitute important elements that may af ect the proportionality of the measures limiting the right.

T e reasons behind this approach to consideration of the rights of others are quite similar to those discussed in relation to public interest considerations. 142 In both cases – the public interest and the rights of others – the correct approach would be, during the f rst stage of the constitutional review, to fully express the ideal underlying the right itself. T en, in the second stage, that same ideal should be confronted with other considerations – such as the one relating to the public interest or that of other people's rights – within the limitation clause requirements and the rules of proportionality they provide. T us, the proper location of these considerations is not at the constitutional level, but rather at the sub-constitutional level. A sub-constitutional law (such as statute or common law) will be declared constitutional if the limitations it places on the right (on freedom of expression, for example) are proportional, whether those limitations were imposed to serve the public interest (such as national security considerations) or whether they were imposed for the protection of the right of others (as in the protection of another person's good reputation, or privacy). Indeed, the constitutional notion of freedom of expression should not be diluted by considerations that are not directly related to the right itself. However, a permissible constitutional limitation on that right would be recognized in order to serve other legitimate aims recognized by the legal system (such as considerations of public interest or the rights of others). Such permissible limitations would be executed through proportional means that would limit the right's realization in a proportional manner.

### 2. T e "rights of others" and constitutional rights conf ict

T e view just presented, according to which the scope of a constitutional right would only be determined according to reasons underlying its

142 See above, at 75.

purpose, will inevitably lead to a conf ict between several rights at the constitutional level. How can we resolve such a conf ict? If we assume that the solution lies in narrowing the scope of the constitutional rights themselves, would that not amount to the narrowing of the scope due the right of others – a possibility we have just ruled out? True, such narrowing did not occur as a result of the interpretation of the right, but rather as a result of the rules relating to intra-constitutional rights conf ict. But the result is the same: T e scope of the constitutional right will be diminished due to the ef ect of other rights. What is the point then of preventing the right of others from entering through the "front door" of the constitutional interpretation analysis (in the f rst stage of the review), only to then allow it to enter through the "back door" (through the rules relating to constitutional rights conf icts)?

T e answer is that the solution in both cases – the constitutional interpretation of rights scope and the conf ict between constitutional rights – should use the same methodology. Accordingly, when the constitutional right to freedom of expression conf icts with the constitutional right to privacy or to good reputation, such conf ict should not af ect the scope of any of the rights involved. T e solution to such conf ict is not found at the constitutional level. Rather, the solution is at the sub-constitutional level. At that level, a limitation on the right to freedom of expression may be constitutional if it was meant to protect the reputation of a person or his privacy, and the degree of the limitation is proportional. T is conclusion requires additional discussion, to which the next chapter is dedicated.

# Conf icting constitutional rights

# **A. Resolving the constitutional confict at the sub-constitutional level**

### 1. A model of constitutional conf ict

 How should the legal system address conf icting constitutional rights? 1 T e answer to this question is usually found within the system's process of legal interpretation. 2 Such interpretation examines the text as a whole. Considerations of analytical clarity, however, require us to draw a distinction between merely interpretive issues and conf ict-of-rights issues; the former, in this context, deal with the meaning of the constitutional text; the latter examine its validity. Accordingly, a distinction is made between issues relating to the scope of constitutional rights – which are interpretive in nature, and may be resolved as part of purposive constitutional interpretation – and issues relating to the conf ict between constitutional rights – which are not interpretive in nature, and therefore cannot be resolved within the conf nes of purposive interpretation but rather should be resolved by the constitutional rules relating to the validity of the rights. 3

 Regarding questions of constitutional validity, what is the proper way to address conf icting constitutional rights? T e answer is that, when two principle-shaped 4 rights conf ict, such a conf ict should not

Brems (ed.), Conf icts Between Fundamental Rights (2008). 2

af ect the validity of the rights 5 or their scope. Instead, such a conf ict would af ect their realization. T e means by which a constitutional right may be realized are determined at the sub-constitutional level, as when a statute or the common law may limit one of the conf icting rights (or both). Such limitations on the conf icting rights are constitutional insofar as they comply with the proportionality requirements set by the limitation clause. Accordingly, a conf ict between principleshaped constitutional rights creates what Alexy calls a "derivative constitutional rule," 6 which ref ects the rules of proportionality. T is new constitutional rule – as its name indicates – stems from the constitution, but in my approach, unlike that of Alexy, it operates only at the sub-constitutional level. It does not af ect the scope of the rights involved; rather, it af ects their realization. It deals with cases in which a constitutional right is limited by a sub-constitutional law (either a statute or the common law). It then determines the constitutionality of this limitation, or lack thereof. It does not determine the scope of the limited right. T e derivative constitutional rule's determinations operate only at the sub-constitutional level.

T e case is dif erent when one (or both) of the conf icting laws is shaped as a rule. 7 Here, the conf ict may af ect the actual scope of the rights involved, or their validity. In these situations, no derivative constitutional rule is created; rather, the ef ect of the conf ict is at the very constitutional level where the rights "reside." T e conf ict's resolution is determined by the rules of conf icting norms, which apply, in principle, at the constitutional level as well. According to these rules, when two legal norms conf ict, the later norm prevails ( lex posterior derogat legi priori ), unless the earlier norm is specif c to the matter at hand ( lex specialis derogat legi generali ). 8

 In order to fully understand my approach, it is worth examining a constitutional conf ict between two constitutional rights shaped as principles more closely. 9 Take, for example, a conf ict between Joe's right to privacy and Jane's right to freedom of expression. As a general rule, each of these constitutional rights – the right to privacy, freedom of expression, and others that may be involved – applies (vertically) vis-à-vis the state. T us,

<sup>6</sup> On derivative constitutional rules, see above, at 38.

Joe has a constitutional right (either positive 10 or negative 11 ) vis-à-vis the state, and Jane has a constitutional right (either positive or negative) visà-vis the state. However, in most cases, Joe does not have a constitutional right vis-à-vis Jane and Jane does not have a constitutional right vis-à-vis Joe. 12 Joe is asking the state to protect his right to privacy vis-à-vis the state; concurrently, Jane is asking the state to protect her right to freedom of expression vis-à-vis the state. In this situation, the state is required to operate through one of its governmental branches – legislative, executive, or judicial – to resolve the conf ict at hand. Once the state decides to act – regardless of the means it applies, its duty vis-à-vis Joe's right conf icts with its duty vis-à-vis Jane. In some cases, the rights involved are "negative" in nature; that is, one or both sides demand that the state refrain from limiting their rights. In those cases, the state must prevent the right from being limited. In other cases, the rights involved are "positive" in nature; that is, rights that should be protected by the state. In those cases, the state is required to actively defend the right in question. 13 T e rights are "channeled" towards the state and it is asked to act to protect them. Such actions may be in the form of legislation, administrative action, or judicial decision. In all such cases, the action is at the sub-constitutional level. Whenever the state acts – through its organs – it may defend one constitutional right while limiting another; in such a case, a conf ict will arise between those rights, within the state's legal zone of authority. T is authority would be exercised at the sub-constitutional level, and the conf ict is between rights expressed in laws found at the sub-constitutional level, such as legislation or common law. Assume, thus, that a statute protects Joe's right to privacy and limits Jane's right to freedom of expression. T e constitutionality of this statute will be determined according to the rules of proportionality. T e rules themselves are of constitutional status, as they originate in the constitutional limitation clause. A derivative constitutional rule is created, determining the proportionality of the

statute. 14 Such a determination operates at the sub-constitutional level in which the conf ict takes place. Hence, the conclusion that a conf ict between constitutional rights (shaped as principles) does not operate at the constitutional level and therefore does not af ect the scope of the rights involved; rather, such a conf ict operates at the sub-constitutional level and af ects the extent of their realization.

# 2. Conf icts between constitutional rights and the rule of law

 Does this approach to a conf ict between two principle-shaped constitutional rights violate the rule of law? 15 Is it not essential, from the viewpoint of the rule of law, to resolve a conf ict of two constitutional rights at the constitutional level? T e answer is that the rule of law is satisf ed whenever the constitutional conf ict is resolved through the use of the rules of proportionality, whose ef ects are felt at the sub-constitutional level. As for the constitutional level, it includes all of the conf icting constitutional principles. Indeed, our constitutional universe may be more complicated than it seems at f rst glance. T e constitutional rights, containing the most fundamental values of society, ref ect ideals competing for their maximum realization. Alas, the nature of human society is such that some of those ideals conf ict. T e way to resolve such a conf ict is not through limiting the scope of one of the ideals (or eliminating it outright); rather, it is through the recognition of the constitutional co-existence of conf icting ideals. 16

Disciplinary Court for Government Employee in Haifa , HCJ 1435/03 [2003] IsrSC 58(1) 527, 538 ("One of the main characteristics of democracy is the wealth of rights, values, and principles, as well as the constant conf ict between some of them. It has been suggested more than once that some of these rights, values, and principles are mirror images of each other, and are therefore in constant conf ict. T e resolution of such conf icts – which are not only a natural part of any democracy, but also nourish and provide it with much-needed vitality – is not through af ecting the scope of such rights, values and interests such that the 'losing' ones would be removed from the constitutional discourse and from the reach of constitutional review. Rather, the solution of such conf icts should be through leaving the conf ict at the constitutional level 'as is,' while determining the proper extent of the protection of the conf icting rights, values, and interests at the level of 'regular' legislation." (Barak, P.)).

principle-based components. 17 Usually, rule-shaped rights are also premised on principles; those principles, however, do not make up one of their components. How should one resolve a conf ict between two such rights?

T e starting point to resolve a conf ict between two rule-shaped rights is to determine whether the conf ict is genuine or imagined. A conf ict is genuine if it cannot be resolved once the interpretive process has been completed. In cases where the conf ict disappears af er applying the interpretive process, or where one constitutional rule is recognized as the exception to the other, then the conf ict is imaginary. However, when dealing with a genuine conf ict, the only possible result is that one constitutional rule must be declared invalid (partly or completely). It is not possible to leave both rules intact within the same legal system. 18 T e determination of which of the two rules would remain and which would be set aside should be done in accordance with the specif c rules governing each legal system. In most systems, however, it is common to assume that the later rule overrules the earlier one ( lex posterior derogat legi priori ), unless the earlier rule is specif c, in which case the specif c prevails over the general rule ( lex specialis derogat legi generali ). 19 Both these – and other – interpretive canons are based on the assumption that whenever two rule-based rights conf ict they cannot both remain in ef ect. Accordingly, one of the rules loses its validity. T ese canons apply at every normative level. T ey therefore also apply in a genuine conf ict between constitutional ruleshaped rights.

# **C. Confict between principle-shaped constitutionalrights**

### 1. T e scope and validity of the conf icting rights are not af ected

 How should the legal system address a conf ict between two principleshaped constitutional rights? Principle-shaped rights consist of fundamental values that ref ect ideals aspiring for their maximum realization. 20 T ose ideals may be realized, however, at dif erent levels of intensity. T ey do not lose their fundamental nature merely because they were not realized to their fullest extent. Take, for example, a case where the legal system recognizes the right to freedom of expression as well as the right to good reputation as constitutional rights. Assume now that these two rights are

in conf ict. How should the legal system resolve such a conf ict between two principle-shaped constitutional rights?

T e answer to this question is not simple. T e starting point should always be that the conf ict should not af ect the validity or the scope of any of the constitutional rights involved. Moreover, the interpretive canons – regarding the later norm prevailing over the earlier norm and the specif c norm prevailing over the general norm – do not apply to such conf icts either. 21 T e result, therefore, is that both conf icting rights remain valid within the legal system, each according to their own scope. T is is one of the major dif erences between a conf ict of rule-shaped rights and a conf ict of principle-shaped rights. A conf ict between rule-shaped constitutional rights ref ects a type of constitutional accident, af er which one of the rights loses its full constitutional scope. 22 T is is not the case when two principle-shaped constitutional rights conf ict. T is kind of conf ict rarely ref ects a constitutional accident. Rather, these conf icts are unavoidable, ref ecting a perfectly natural state of af airs and expressing the very nature of those constitutional principles aspiring for maximum realization. T ese aspirations lead those principles to clash with other constitutional principles also aspiring to be fully realized. 23 Both constitutional rights, however, survive the clash unscathed at the constitutional level: both remain valid according to their original scope. T ey remain intact within the legal system's boundaries. 24

(Barak, P.)). See also D. Grimm, "Human Rights and Judicial Review in Germany," in D. M. Beatty (ed.), Human Rights and Judicial Review: A Comparative Perspective (London: Martinus
 According to the analysis of ered here, a conf ict between two principle-shaped constitutional rights will not af ect either their scope or their validity. Indeed, most legal systems acknowledge a situation where two constitutional rights overlap with regard to a certain human behavior while their provisions conf ict with each other (at least in part). T is legal situation – impossible in the case of rule-shaped constitutional rights – is natural to a conf ict between two constitutional rights shaped as principles. 25

 What then is the conf ict's resolution? T e conf ict is resolved not within the area of the constitutional right's scope or validity, but rather in the realization of the rights involved. 26 Only the extent of the right's protection is af ected as a result of the conf ict, and therefore the conf ict's ef ects may be found only at the sub-constitutional level. 27

### 2. T e ef ect on the realization of the conf icting rights

 How does a conf ict between principle-shaped constitutional rights af ect the realization of such rights? T e answer to this question is found in the rules of proportionality within the limitation clause. T ese rules establish

Nijhof Publishers, 1994), 267, 273 ("T e value – or principle – of orientation means that the value embodied in a constitutional provision, particularly in a human right, has to be maximized as much as possible … [I]f a collision between two or more constitutionally guaranteed values occurs, the question is not to determine which one prevails but to f nd a solution which leaves the greatest possible ef ect to both of them ( Prakische

- Konkordanz )."). 25 See H. Cheadle, N. Haysom, and D. Davis (eds.), South African Constitutional Law: T e Bill of Rights ( 2003 ), 700 ("Rights with competing claims can overlap. T ere is an overlap of the right of freedom of expression, the right to privacy, and the right to dignity in respect of defamatory speech. Claims based on these rights compete with each other. It is unnecessary, in a constitution with a limitation clause, to def ne the borders of the rights in such a way that the border of the right to freedom of expression ends where the right to dignity begins. In other words, it is not necessary to balance the competing claims of
- dif erent rights at this stage of the analysis."). 26 See A. S. Butler, "Limiting Rights," 33 Victoria U. Wellington L. Rev . 113, 122 (2002); S. Mize, "Resolving Cases of Conf icting Rights under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act,"
- 22 New Zealand U. L. Rev . 50, 63 (2006). 27 See Cheadle, Haysom, and Davis, above note 25, at 700 ("It is more appropriate that competing claims arising from the overlap of rights be resolved by law rather than by an abstract balancing of rights to determine common and impermeable boundaries. T e law can strike the balance between the competing claims arising from the rights, and that balance can be assessed under the proportionality analysis under the second stage of the enquiry. Instead of erecting walls between rights, one right may overlap with another and yet be limited by a law, whether statutory or common law, that not only gives ef ect to the other constitutional rights but justif es the limitation.").

a derivative constitutional rule 28 that operates solely at the sub-constitutional level. T is kind of rule determines the result of the constitutional conf ict, realized at the sub-constitutional level. T e result may thus be found in the dif erent areas of law where such realizations take place. T us, for example, the result of a conf ict between the constitutional right to freedom of speech ( vis-à-vis the state) and the constitutional right to a good reputation ( vis-à-vis the state) may be found within the law of torts, which prohibits libel and slander, with recognized exceptions. T ese laws provide one person with rights that may be used against another. Importantly, these areas of the law (such as tort law) do not provide – and cannot provide – constitutional rights, but only sub-constitutional rights.

 To understand this argument, we must realize that it is the legislator that ultimately makes the decision of preferring one person's constitutional right vis-à-vis the state (e.g., to enjoy good reputation) over another person's constitutional right vis-à-vis the state (e.g., to freedom of expression). T e same applies to the common law or to an administrative act. When a person makes the claim vis-à-vis the state that his or her constitutional rights were improperly limited, they in fact claim that such a limitation is unconstitutional. Such a claim is reviewed in accordance with the rules of proportionality. T is review does not change the scope of the rights involved, but rather af ects the extent of the right's protection – i.e., the ability to realize them in accordance with the proportionality rules found in the limitation clause. Take, for example, the claim that the law (statutory or common law) of libel is unconstitutional as it disproportionally limits the constitutional rights to freedom of speech, to enjoy good reputation, or to privacy (all vis-à-vis the state). T ese arguments are reviewed through the lens of proportionality rules. T e results of this review operate only at the sub-constitutional level.

 In the Israeli Supreme Court case of Jane Doe , 29 disciplinary proceedings were initiated against the defendant for the alleged sexual harassment of Jane Doe. Due to the defendant's medical condition, which may have been revealed during the hearings, the court ordered that the hearings be conducted in chambers (i.e., behind closed doors). T e petitioner, Jane Doe, testif ed at one of the hearings. She also demanded to be present during all other hearings and to be granted full access to the court's transcripts and proceedings. T e administrative tribunal – the trial-level

<sup>28</sup> On derivative constitutional rules, see above, at 39.

<sup>29</sup> See Jane Doe , above note 16.

court – refused, reasoning that the defendant's right to privacy should prevail over Jane Doe's interest in attending the hearings. Jane Doe petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court, which granted the petition and reversed the decision. According to the relevant Israeli statute, the Law of State Service (Discipline) (1963), the administrative tribunal may close its doors and not hold public hearings (i.e., hear arguments in chambers) "in order to protect morality." 30 T e issue before the court was whether the concept of "protect[ing] morality" constituted a suf ciently good reason to prevent the petitioner from being present at the hearings. T e Court held it did not. T e judgment went on to explain that the petitioner's – here, Jane Doe's – constitutional right vis-à-vis the state to a public hearing (which may be derived from the Israeli Basic Law: T e Judiciary 31 ) prevails over the defendant's constitutional right to privacy vis-à-vis the state (which is explicitly recognized by the text of the Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty). 32 T erefore, the court concluded, the statutory language relating to the "protection of morality" cannot include incidents where the victim's right to a public hearing is limited. In my judgment, I wrote:

> We are dealing with an area in which the right to privacy and the principle of public hearings conf ict. Such a conf ict ref ects a normal condition in a democratic society, where human rights constantly clash with each other (as in the case where the right to freedom of expression clashes with the right to enjoy a good reputation), and where human rights clash with values and fundamental principles of the society (as in the case where freedom of expression is in conf ict with national security and safety considerations). Other than in the most extreme cases, this kind of conf ict does not require a re-determination of the boundaries of the rights, values, and interests while invalidating the right, value, or interest that "lost" in the conf ict. T us, for example, we do not hold today that the right to freedom of expression does not entail an expression that may infringe upon another person's reputation. If we were to so hold, then we would signif cantly reduce the scope of both the constitutional rights and the values and principles that enjoy constitutional protection, and we would have created a legal framework where regular legislation that relates to good reputation would not abide by the constitutional limitations of such a right. T is is an unwanted result, and it should be avoided – save for those rare cases in which we have no choice but to determine – at the constitutional level – the boundaries of each right. 33

Later in that decision, this point was further elaborated:

 In such a conf ict, we cannot say that one right prevails over the other, or that one right renders the other right void. Both rights continue to exist at the constitutional level in the Israeli legal system. Accordingly, the Israeli right to privacy includes the individual's right to privacy during court hearings; similarly, the (constitutional) principle of public hearing includes cases in which such publicity limits one's privacy. T e resolution of this conf ict – a solution that should be reached so that both parties, as well as the public as a whole, know how to plan their actions – is not found at the constitutional level; rather, such a solution can be found within the dif erent legislative acts and their proper interpretation. T ese statutes limit both privacy and publicity. T eir constitutionality is determined according to the provisions of the limitation clause. 34

 How, then, are such conf icts f nally resolved? In order to answer that question, a distinction between several types of cases must be made.

### 3. Interpretive balancing between principle-shaped constitutional rights

T e f rst typical case of conf icting constitutional rights may be exemplif ed by the facts of the Israeli Supreme Court case of Jane Doe discussed earlier. T ere, Jane Doe (the alleged victim of a sexual harassment) asked the court to realize her constitutional right to a public hearing vis-à-vis the state, while the defendant relied on their constitutional right vis-àvis the state to privacy. Both relied on a statute – the Law of State Service (Discipline) – which allows for non-public administrative hearings "in order to protect morality." 35 T e interpretation of this provision – like any other statutory provision – was done as per its underlying purpose. T is purpose, the court noted, should have taken into account not only the right to public hearings, but also the right to privacy. 36 Both those rights are taken into account – in their full scope – while determining the statutory provision's purpose, 37 and because they are in a state of conf ict the interpreter has to balance between them. T is is an interpretive balance. 38 It considers each of the rights by taking into account their weight, in light

<sup>34</sup> Ibid ., at 539. 35 See Art. 41(B) of the Law. 36 More precisely, one does not take into account the (subjective) constitutional right but rather the (objective) constitutional principles that ref ect those rights; see below, at 276. 37 See above, at 72.

<sup>38</sup> On interpretive balance, see above, at 72.

of the facts of the case. It ref ects, by analogy, the balance drawn within the limitation clause's proportionality stricto sensu . 39 T e purpose of this balancing, however, is not to determine the constitutionality of the statute; rather, it is designed to provide meaning to the statute in accordance with its purpose, where the purpose ref ects a balance between the two conf icting rights. Accordingly, this is an interpretive balance. By using the said balancing, one is not applying the limitation clause. For example, there is no need to examine each of the limitation clause's components; whether the law has been created to serve a proper purpose is of no importance here. Similarly, the rational connection and necessary means (the "less damaging alternative") components should also not be considered. T e only relevant component of proportionality to the interpretive balancing act is the component of proportionality stricto sensu . 40 T is is solely an interpretive balance. Its "proportional" nature stems from the application – by analogy – of the rules relating to proportionality stricto sensu .

### 4. Constitutional validity

 Let us assume now – and this is the second type of case relating to conf icting rights – that the defendant in Jane Doe (the alleged sexual harasser, whose medical condition was about to be published during the proceedings) argued that the statutory provision at issue, according to its proper interpretation, disproportionally limits his constitutional right to privacy and therefore is unconstitutional. T is type of argument advances the analytical process from interpretive balancing to the examination of the limitation clause. In Israel, this kind of limitation clause can be found within Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, which also establishes the constitutional right to privacy. T is right to privacy has been limited, and the focal point of the discussion now moves to the rules of proportionality. T ese proportionality rules are the "instruments" designed by the legal system to resolve such conf icts. Within the framework of these proportionality rules, the court must balance between the defendant's right to privacy – a right limited by the statutory provision – and Jane Doe's right to a public hearing. T is balancing is not interpretive. T e result of this balance determines whether the statutory provision limiting the constitutional right is constitutional.

39 On this type of balance, see below, at 341.

40 See below, at 341.

### 5. Conf icting rights with no implementing legislation

 In the third situation, no legislation implementing one of the constitutional rights exists. Let's assume, for example, that there is no legislation implementing the right to a public hearing (and its exceptions). In this hypothetical case, Jane Doe argues that the constitutional right to a public hearing (which in Israel can be deduced from Basic Law: T e Judiciary), which she possesses vis-à-vis the state, directly entitles her to be present in each of the hearings against the defendant and to review the court's transcripts. At the same time, the defendant argues that the right to privacy (which is established, in Israel, by Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty), which he possesses vis-à-vis the state, directly entitles him to prevent the complainant from attending the hearings or reviewing the court's transcript. How should such a conf ict be resolved?

T e f rst step of the examination requires that we rule out a "negative solution" scenario. 41 T ese are cases where the legislator has informed us of its view via a "speaking silence" or "informed silence." A negative solution is based on the notion that the legislative text exhausted the legislative purpose. T e silence on a specif c issue is therefore "informed"; it carries a specif c meaning, which is, in most cases, a conscious choice not to regulate the matter at hand. If, indeed, the legislative silence constitutes a negative solution – which operates at the sub-constitutional level – then we have to examine the constitutionality of such an arrangement. Indeed, it is not only legislative provisions (explicit or implicit) which can be found unconstitutional: a legislative silence which is found to be a negative solution might also be found unconstitutional. A negative solution is based on silence that carries a message. It is a "speaking" silence, and its message may limit a constitutional right or prevent its proper protection. T e constitutionality of such a negative solution will be determined according to the limitation clause's rules of proportionality. If, however, the legislative silence does not constitute a negative solution but rather a gap (or lacuna) 42 – or, in other words, the legislative silence was not informed – then the silence should be completed through the rules governing legislative gaps. In Israel, those rules are established by the Law of Legal Foundations, 1980, which provides:

> Where the court, faced with a legal question requiring a solution, could f nd no answer in a statute, the case law, or by analogy the court, shall

- 41 For "negative solution," see Barak, above note 19, at 68.
- 42 Regarding legislative gaps, see above, at 56.

decide the issue in light of the principles of freedom, justice, equity and peace of Israel's heritage. 43

T is is the legislative provision on which Israeli judges rely to complete a legislative gap. Accordingly, the judge's f rst step – af er concluding that no other statutory or common law answers are readily available – is to examine possible analogies. An analogy is the natural way to f ll a legislative gap. When a relevant analogy does not present itself, the next step would be to turn to the principles of liberty, justice, and integrity provided by Israel's historical legacy. Importantly, such judicial gap-f lling should abide by the requirements presented by the limitation clause's proportionality rules. T is is because, in Israel, such gap-f lling is done in accordance with a sub-constitutional norm (the Law of Legal Foundations). In addition, this kind of gap-f lling protects one constitutional right vis-à-vis the state while limiting another such right. Gap-f lling, therefore, operates at the sub-constitutional level and is subject to the requirements presented by the limitation clause's rules of proportionality.

 How should the legal system address a situation where the legislative silence is neither a negative solution nor a legislative gap? In this case, having exhausted all interpretive options, the judge in a common law system is entitled to exercise judicial lawmaking in developing the common law. T ese common law powers may result in the granting of a subconstitutional right to one person and revoking it in respect of another. Importantly, however, this judicial creation is not limitless, but rather is limited by the limitation clause's proportionality rules. Indeed, since the ef ect of such common law rulings is at the sub-constitutional level, it should abide by the requirements set by the limitation clause's proportionality rules. 44

 Another important question is whether circumstances exist whereby the legislator – or the judge – is constitutionally required to act to protect a constitutional right adversely af ected by the legislative silence. T is issue will be discussed at a later stage during the discussion surrounding "positive" constitutional rights. 45T is analysis suggests that, in every case that we f nd a conf ict between principle-shaped constitutional rights, its resolution should be conducted at the sub-constitutional – rather than the constitutional – level. T is may manifest itself through primary legislation or delegated rulemaking, or through judicial gap-f lling or judicial

<sup>43</sup> Law of Legal Foundations (1980), Art. 1 (translated by the present author).

<sup>44</sup> See below, at 121. 45 See below, at 422.

lawmaking. Importantly, all these activities are conducted at the subconstitutional level. All these should be proportional.

### 6. Conf icting rights which lead to a conf ict between the legislation which def nes their realization

T e fourth type of rights-conf ict case involves a situation where a statute was enacted by the legislator, allowing for a limitation on one constitutional right – for example, the right to privacy – in order to protect another – for example, the right to a public judicial hearing. T e constitutionality of this statute is not questioned. Assume now that another statute has been passed – whose constitutionality is again not in question – that enables a limitation on the right to a public hearing in order to protect the right to privacy. We are then faced with two conf icting statutory provisions: one enabling a limitation on the constitutional right to privacy in order to protect the constitutional right to public hearing, while the other allows for the reverse. How should such a conf ict be resolved? Obviously, the interpreter must f rst attempt everything in their power to avoid such a conf ict. 46 T ey must try to interpret both statutes as harmoniously co-existing within the system. What is the solution, assuming all such ef orts have been exhausted and the two legislative provisions are still in conf ict?

 Once again we are dealing with a conf ict at the sub-constitutional level. If both statutory provisions are structured as rule-shaped rights, the conf ict would be viewed as a legislative-level conf ict. However, if the rights are shaped as principles, the conf ict between the two provisions will not be resolved at the legislative level, but rather, in most cases, at the sub-legislative level. T at would ultimately be the level at which the normative arrangement is reduced to rules, rather than principles. Such a conf ict would be resolved according to the canons that usually govern these situations, such as the rule later in time overriding the earlier rule, unless the earlier rule is more specif c than the later, general rule.

T is analysis raises the following question: have we not introduced – admittedly, through the "back door" – the same rules that apply to conf icts between rule-shaped rights to a conf ict between principle-shaped rights? T e answer is no. Both constitutional rights – in this case, privacy and disclosure – are lef intact; their scope is not af ected at the constitutional level. T e only change is on the sub-constitutional level – here, the

46 See Barak, above note 19, at 160.

legislative level, the administrative-act level, or the common law level – where the conf ict is resolved. T is level does not occupy itself with the scope of the constitutional rights, but only their realization.

# **D. A confict between a principle-shaped right and a rule-shaped right**

 How should the legal system address a conf ict between a rule-shaped right and a principle-shaped right? To answer this question, we must distinguish between two principal scenarios. In the f rst, both conf icting rights are at the constitutional level. In the second, one of the rights is at the constitutional level while the other is at the sub-constitutional level.

 Let us begin with the conf ict between two constitutional rights, one shaped as a rule while the other is shaped as a principle. As in all other cases, the f rst task the interpreter faces is to try and resolve the conf ict in such a way that the two rights are able to harmoniously co-exist. Amongst other things, the interpreter may consider the possibility that the ruleshaped arrangement was meant to af ect the right's realization, not its original scope, or that the rule was meant to serve as an exception to the principle. In this context, the interpreter may use interpretive balancing, while analogizing the balancing rules appearing in the proportionality stricto sensu component of the proportionality rules. T e remainder of the proportionality components – such as proper purpose, rational connection, and necessary means (the "less damaging alternative") – do not apply and should not be considered here. But what is the case when such an interpretive attempt fails? What should the interpreter do when the rule-shaped constitutional right is ultimately interpreted as a norm designed to change the scope of the principle-shaped constitutional right? Which of the two constitutional rights should prevail? T e answer is that in this type of conf ict the normal interpretive canons, according to which the specif c right should prevail over the general right, will usually apply; and, if the principle-shaped right is later in time, it may be interpreted as impliedly repealing the specif c right that is rule-shaped. In this type of conf ict, the limitation clause – and its rules of proportionality – does not apply. T e scope of the constitutional rights is af ected.

 In the second scenario, we are dealing with a conf ict of norms that are not at the same level. T is is a conf ict between a constitutional right (shaped as either a rule or a principle) and a statutory right (or an administrative act, or common-law-based right shaped as either a rule or a principle). In this type of case, the sub-constitutional right cannot af ect the scope of the constitutional right. T e constitutional validity of the subconstitutional norm is determined in accordance with the requirements set by the limitation clause. Even if such a right abides by those requirements, its only ef ect would be at the sub-constitutional level, limiting the ways in which the constitutional right may be realized, not its scope.

 Take, for example, the case of a principle-shaped constitutional right ("every person has the right to privacy"). Now assume that a statute sets a specif c provision – shaped as a rule – relating to the right to public hearings. Such a determination may limit the right to privacy. However, this kind of provision may not af ect the scope of the constitutional right to privacy. T e provision does limit privacy, but this limitation would be constitutional if, and only if, it abides by all the requirements set by the limitation clause's rules of proportionality. T e same would apply if the constitutional right is shaped as a rule while the sub-constitutional norm is shaped as a principle. Let us assume, for that matter, a rule-shaped constitutional provision relating exclusively to the right to public hearings. Let us further assume a principle-shaped legislative provision relating to the right to privacy. T e statutory provision may not af ect the scope of the constitutional provision. T e constitutionality of such an act would be determined in accordance with the requirements set by the limitation clause.

# Limitation of constitutional rights

# **A. Limitation and amendment ofrights**

 A fundamental distinction exists between the amendment of a constitutional right and its limitation. T e amendment of a constitutional right requires an amendment of the constitution, while a limitation of the right is possible with no constitutional change. T e distinction stems from the more basic distinction between the right's scope and the extent of its protection. An amendment of a right entails a change – a narrowing or expansion – of its scope; such a change, in turn, af ects the persons and institutions governed by the right, its content, or its application in terms of time and place. T us, for example, a constitutional amendment would be a change in a constitutional provision – which currently applies to any person – according to which the provision would, from now on, apply only to citizens. Such a change is possible only through the mechanism of a constitutional amendment. Here, the proportionality of the constitutional change does not play a role. A statutory provision which intends to lead to such a change in the constitution is unconstitutional regardless of its proportionality. Conversely, a limitation of a constitutional right only narrows the ability to realize the right without changing the right's actual boundaries. 1 T ese limitations are constitutional only if they are proportional, as required by the limitation clause.

T e distinction between a constitutional change (which requires a constitutional amendment) and the limitation of a constitutional right (through a proportional sub-constitutional law) is not always self-evident. T e proper criterion to distinguish between the two should be objective in nature and not require an inquiry into the subjective intent of the law's creators. Naturally, the application of such an objective test may lead to substantial dif culties. Take, for example, the Canadian Supreme Court

<sup>1</sup> See E. Heinze, T e Logic of Constitutional Rights (Burlington, VT: Ashgate Publishing, 2005 ), 13–26; B. Pieroth and B. Schlink, Gdundrechte Staatsrecht II (Heidelberg: C. F. Müller Verlag, 2006 ), 58.

case of Quebec Protestant School Boards . 2 T ere, the court was asked to examine the constitutionality of a Quebec statute that limited the acceptance of English-speaking students who studied English outside Quebec into English-speaking schools in Quebec, in an alleged violation of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 3 T e Canadian Supreme Court held that the proposed change – through a statute – to the constitutional right cannot be considered a mere limitation whose constitutionality need be determined by the provisions of the limitation clause. Rather, the change should be seen as a complete denial of the constitutional right without following the rules required by the Charter for a constitutional amendment. T erefore, the court invalidated the statute and declared it unconstitutional; importantly, it did so without even examining whether the proposed change was as per the limitation clause. T e court then added the following clarif cation:

> An Act of Parliament or of a legislature which, for example, purported to impose the belief of a state religion would be in direct conf ict with Section 2(a) of the Charter, which guarantees freedom of conscience and religion, and would have to be ruled of no force or ef ect without the necessity of even considering whether such legislation could be legitimized by Section 1. T e same applies to [the Quebec provision] in respect to Section 23 of the Charter. 4

 A more recent ruling by the Canadian Supreme Court emphasized that only a "complete denial" of the constitutional right would not be considered a mere "limitation" and therefore not examined through the lens of the limitation clause. 5 T e decision was heavily criticized. Hogg argued that there is no rational basis to dif erentiate between a right's "denial" – whether partial or complete – and a right's limitation. In his opinion, any denial (partial or complete) should be considered a limitation whose constitutionality should be determined by the limitation clause. 6 It is hard to support such an approach. 7 With all the dif culties arising from the distinction between a constitutional change of a right and its limitation,

these dif culties should not deter us from using this analytically sound, constitutionally vital, distinction.

 What should be the criterion to distinguish between a denial of right and a limitation thereof? T e answer is that the proper criterion is the extent and the intensity of the change or the limitation, which is examined according to the results of the opposing norm and not its creators' intent. Take, for example, a legislative provision which provides that the right to freedom of occupation applies only to citizens. T is is a denial of the right and not just a limitation. An examination of the proportionality of the provision according to the rules provided by the limitation clause will not suf ce. In contrast, legislation restricting incitement speech, which leads to violence, or the publication of materials considered obscene, merely limits the constitutional right to freedom of speech; such provisions do not constitute a change of that right. Accordingly, such a limitation may be achieved through legislation as long as that legislation is proportional.

# **B. Limitation on rights**

### 1. Infringement and limitation on rights

 A limitation of a constitutional right by law also means its infringement by law. 8 Accordingly, several constitutions use these terms (limitation, infringement) interchangeably. In Israel, for example, the Basic Laws use the Hebrew equivalent of the term "infringement." 9 Conversely, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms uses the term "limits," 10 which is also used by many other Western constitutions. T ere appears to be no dif erence between them. Accordingly, in this book, no distinction is made between a limitation on and an infringement of a constitutional right by law. 11 For convenience, this book uses the term "limitation."

- ety." (emphasis added)). 11 T e term "infringement" is of en used in American legal discourse. See, e.g., F. Schauer, "Commensurability and Its Constitutional Consequences," 45 Hastings L. J . 785 ( 1994 ).

 A limitation on a right occurs whenever a state action denies or prevents the right's owner from exercising it to its fullest scope. T is is all that is required; accordingly, a limitation occurs whether the ef ect on the right is signif cant or marginal; whether the limitation is related to the right's core or to its penumbra; whether it is intentional or not; or whether it is carried out by an act or an omission (when there is a duty to positively protect the right 12 ). Indeed, every limitation is unconstitutional unless it is proportional. Only when the statutory provision limiting the constitutional right is proportional – when it fulf lls all the requirements of the limitation clause – can we say that the limitation is valid. Only then can the constitutional right peacefully co-exist with its limitation. When that same provision, however, does not abide by the proportionality rules set by the constitutional limitation clause, we conclude that the right has been violated. When the constitutional right can no longer co-exist with such a limitation; the solution must be an assertion that the limitation is invalid. We thus have to distinguish between a limitation that is proportional and therefore valid, and a limitation that is not proportional and therefore invalid. When the limitation is not valid, we say that the right has been violated (or breached). 13

T is seemingly straightforward analysis may lead to semantic conundrums. Take, for example, a provision limiting the constitutional right to equality. If the limitation is not proportional, and is therefore unconstitutional, we assert that the provision is discriminatory. Assume now that the provision, despite its limitation on the right to equality, is proportional and therefore constitutional. Is this provision therefore a "valid discrimination"? Or should the term "discrimination" be used only for those cases where the limitation is disproportional and therefore unconstitutional? If that is the case, how would we refer to a valid constitutional limitation on the right to equality? In one case, it was claimed, with regard to the limitation of equality, that "the distinction is no longer solely between equality (which is legal) and discrimination (which is illegal). We must now dif erentiate between the right to equality and the constitutional possibility of limiting such a right while fulf lling the requirements of the limitation clause." 14 What terminology should we

use in such a situation? One should not hesitate in calling this constitutional discrimination.

### 2. De minimis constitutional limitations

 Every limitation of the constitutional right requires an examination as to its constitutionality. In that respect, there is no dif erence between a broad and a narrow limitation. Even a narrowly applied limitation – in terms of the number of people it applies to, its subject matter or the time and place in which it applies – requires a complete examination according to the proportionality rules set within the limitation clause. But, what about limitations so small that their ef ect is minimal? Does a de minimis limitation raise a constitutional problem? 15 In some legal systems, the accepted approach is that no constitutional examination is required when the limitation is trivial or insubstantial. T e Canadian Supreme Court, for example, examined this question in the Jones case, 16 where the issue was a statutory provision relating to parents wishing to homeschool their children. T e provision required parents to f rst apply to the state for approval of their proposed homeschooling curriculum. One of these parents, Jones, refused to apply for a permit as he did not recognize the authority of the state over the educational af airs of his child. As it turned out, had he applied for such a permit, he would have received one. Still, Jones claimed that the statutory provision violated his constitutional freedom of religion and therefore should be struck down. T e court did not accept the argument, ruling that the statute was constitutional. Justice Wilson, in a separate opinion, ruled that the case did not even raise a constitutional issue, as the limitation on the right was "trivial." 17 A similar approach was adopted by the Israeli Supreme Court. 18

<sup>15</sup> See M. Sachs (ed.), Grundgesetz Kommentar (2003), 64. 16 T e Queen v. Jones [1986] 2 SCR 284. 17 Ibid ., at 313 ("[N]ot every ef ect of legislation on religious beliefs or practices is of ensive to the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion. Section 2(a) does not require the legislature to refrain from imposing any burdens on the practice of religion. Legislative or administrative action whose ef ect on religion is trivial or insubstantial is not, in my

view, a breach of freedom of religion." (Wilson, J.)). 18 See United Mizrahi Bank Ltd . v. Migdal Cooperative Village , CA 6821/93 [1995] IsrLR 1 at 237 ("[T]he constitutional prohibition applies to the infringement on the right to property. Every infringement violates the prohibition, and shif s the constitutional review to the limitation clause. At the same time, when the infringement on the right is trivial or minor – if it can be classif ed as de minimis – then it will not be regarded as an infringement and there is no need to embark upon the constitutional review of the second phase." (Barak, P.)); HCJ 3434/96 Hof nung v. Knesset Speaker [1996] IsrSC 50(3)

T is approach does not claim that a "trivial" limitation does not limit the right in question. It argues that this kind of de minimis limitation does not trigger – or require – constitutional review. Furthermore, the "minimal" nature of the limitation as well as its characterization as de minimis may change from one set of circumstances to another. T erefore, an answer is required as to the proper test for characterizing a limitation as "trivial" or "minimal." Noting the importance of this question, Justice Zamir of the Israeli Supreme Court observed:

> A question arises as to how we can measure a limitation and when we can consider it minimal. T e answer depends, among others, on the nature of the right in question, the limitation's purpose, and the specif c circumstances of each case. Accordingly, the answer may change from one case to another. 19

 A more general question, arising in this context, is whether the test for determining the minimal nature of the limitation should be objective – that is, ref ecting the minimal nature of the limitation from the standpoint of the legal system as a whole – or should it be subjective – reviewing the limitation from the standpoint of the person af ected by the limitation? T e test should be made up of both objective and subjective elements. We should not forget that we are dealing with individual constitutional rights and limitations placed upon them by the state. Accordingly, it would be proper to examine the nature of the limitation from the subjective standpoint of the individual whose right was limited. However, this subjective test should also entail an objective component, such that, while considering the ef ects of the limitation, we should not take into account any exceptional attributes or unique circumstances of the specif c person af ected; rather, we should consider the limitation from the standpoint of a reasonable and typical person of the kind actually af ected. T erefore, according to these tests, Justice Wilson's dissenting opinion in Jones may not correspond to the facts of the case. Indeed, from Mr. Jones' standpoint – and other reasonable persons of his kind, all belonging to a group of persons of deep religious faith – who was required, against his expressed belief, to appeal to state authorities in matters relating to the religious education of

ment on the right." (Zamir, J.)). 19 See Hof nung v. Knesset Speaker , above note 18, at 68.

<sup>57, 68 (&</sup>quot;In order for the Court to strike down a law, the infringement in question cannot be minimal or trivial, but rather substantial and noticeable. T is is the way this Court has acted in every legal issue. T e Court does not tend to deal with insignif cant matters: de minimis non curat lex . Accordingly, this Court would not examine a minimal infringe-

his own children, the requirement to appeal to the authorized authority is a limitation that is neither minimal nor trivial. 20

### 3. Incidental limitations

 Incidental limitations occur whenever a statutory provision which according to its proper interpretation deals with one issue has an "incidental" ef ect of limiting a separate constitutional right, beyond its scope. Are incidental limitations on a constitutional right included in the same category as all other limitations? If so, the constitutionality of such a limitation should be examined within the rules of proportionality. If not, the issue of constitutionality does not arise and the rules of proportionality do not apply. T is question cannot be given an inclusive answer. On the one hand, not every incidental limitation falls into the category of a constitutional "limitation." On the other hand, not every incidental limitation falls outside either. T e answer is therefore case-specif c and is largely dependant on the proper interpretation of the right in question. 21 Take, for example, freedom of occupation. Assume that a tax law provision is passed, raising taxes and therefore making it harder to realize that freedom. Such a provision would be considered a limitation on the constitutional right of freedom of occupation and therefore would have to be reviewed within the framework of the proportionality rules found in the limitation clause. T e same is true for legislative provisions rendering the cost of employment more expensive or otherwise adversely af ecting the ability of employers to realize their constitutional freedom. But what is the case when the same tax law provision also makes it harder to realize an occupation involving the freedom of expression (such as being a reporter)? Should we view that provision as limiting the freedom of expression? T e answer is no. T is is an example of an incidental limitation. 22 When the limitation is merely "incidental," it should not trigger a proportionality examination. However, the question of whether a limitation is "direct" or "incidental" is not always easily applicable. In fact, the very same limitation may be found to be "incidental" regarding one right

<sup>20</sup> See G. V. La Forest, "T e Balancing of Interests under the Charter," 2 Nat'l J. Const . 134, 141 (1992) ("Mr. Jones' situation may have been trivial from the majority's point of view, but if Mr. Jones sincerely believed the law violated his religious convictions, that was good enough for me."). 21 H. Cheadle, N. Haysom, and D. Davis (eds.), South African Constitutional Law: T e Bill of

Rights ( 2003 ), 700. 22 Ibid .

(freedom of expression), and "non-incidental" or "direct" – and therefore triggering a proportional examination – in relation to another right (freedom of occupation).

### 4. Waiving constitutional rights

 Can a person unilaterally waive a constitutional right? Can an individual come to an agreement with the state waiving such a right? Is this waiver constitutional? Should such a waiver be examined in the f rst stage of the constitutional review (the right's scope stage) or during the second (the extent of its realization stage)? If the latter, should the waiver be proportional in accordance with the rules prescribed by the limitation clause? Can we say that the waiver is "according to the law"? All these are important questions; yet the constitutions themselves of er very little guidance, and neither the literature nor the courts have explored the issues suf ciently. 23 Uncertainty and confusion abound. 24

 Woolman is correct in saying that the waiver question should not be considered on its own; rather, the real question is whether, despite the waiver vis-à-vis the state to exercise a right to its fullest extent, the right has actually been limited. T is question should be examined separately for each waived right. If the answer is that the waived right was not limited by the state in the f rst place, no constitutional issue arises and the inquiry ends. If, on the other hand, the waived right has been limited by the state, then the limiting actions taken by the state towards the waiving party would have to be examined in accordance with the proportionality requirements. Either way, there is no room for the creation of separate constitutional waiver rules.

24 See, e.g., K. Hopkins, "Constitutional Rights and the Question of Waiver: How Fundamental Are Fundamental Rights?," 16 SAPL 122 ( 2001 ); S. Woolman, "Application," in S. Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa, 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 122 ("Whether the benef ciaries of constitutional rights can waive their rights is an underdeveloped and confusing area of constitutional law.").

# Limiting constitutional rights by law

# **A. Te legality principle**

### 1. Legal authority to limit a right

 In a constitutional democracy, a constitutional right cannot be limited unless such a limitation is authorized by law. 1T is is the principle of legality. 2 From here stems the requirement – which can be found in modern constitutions' limitation clauses, as well as in other international documents – that any limitation on a right be "prescribed by law." At the basis of this requirement stands the principle of the rule of law. 3 Every provision limiting a constitutional right must derive from a legal norm whose authority can be traced back – either directly or indirectly – to the constitution itself. 4 If this authority cannot be found, the limitation is unconstitutional. It can be said that in these matters the principle of legality – and the authorization it requires – is a threshold requirement. It is the legal "threshold" to the laws of proportionality. If the legality requirements are not satisf ed, there is no need – and no reason – to examine the proportionality issue.

T e legality principle requires legal authorization – which can be traced back to the constitution itself – to limit a constitutional right. T is is the " authorization chain" requirement of having a "constitutional legal

pedigree." 5 T is requirement represents a formal aspect of the rule-of-law principle. In addition to this formal requirement, the legality principle has been interpreted as requiring three other conditions: 6 f rst, in several legal systems an authorization of a general nature, or a "general application" authorization; second, accessibility to the law; and, third, clarity of the law. T ese requirements are based on a jurisprudential understanding of the principle of the rule of law. 7 It establishes additional requirements, which in turn represent the very essence of a constitutional democracy. T ese requirements are essential for the rule of law, not of men. T is is what Rawls called "formal justice," 8 and Fuller named "the inner morality of the law." 9 T e list of these requirements is not f nal: it develops along with the understanding of the nature of law and its place in our society. 10 T e legal basis for these requirements is in the interpretation of the word "law" in the limitation clause. We turn now to take a closer look at the principle of legality, as well as its underlying notion of the rule of law. 11

### 2. T e authorization chain

### i. Normative validity stemming explicitly or implicitly from the constitution

T e basic requirement in every constitutional democracy is that every limitation on a constitutional right be traced back to a valid legal norm. A valid legal norm means a norm that is a part of the hierarchical structure

- See, e.g., Sunday Times v. United Kingdom , App. No. 6538/74, 2 EHRR 245 (1980). 7
- On this aspect of the principle, see A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 54. See also J. Raz, T e Authority of Law: Essays on Law and Morality (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979 ), 210. 8

- See L. L. Fuller, T e Morality of Law (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1969 ), 33. 10 See A. Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 51. 11 T e proper location for the discussion of the principle of legality within these pages has been a source of much debate for me. On the one hand, the principle does not constitute a component of the proportionality rules themselves, and therefore should not appear in the third part of the book (dealing with those components). On the other hand, the legality principle is not a part of the right's scope either – the issue of the f rst part of the book. It does, however, form a part of the limitation clause. In this book, I have distinguished between the limitation of the right (which is discussed in the f rst part of the book), and the components of proportionality (discussed in the third). Due to the close proximity of the issue of legality to that of limitation of a right, I decided in favor of placing the legality discussion in the pages following the discussion on the limitation itself.

<sup>5</sup> See Van der Schyf , above note 1, at 134; Garibaldi, above note 2, at 506. 6

of the legal system. In other words, it should be based on a chain of authority starting with the constitution itself. T e constitutional authorization for such a limitation may be explicit or implicit. T e legislator's explicit authority to legislate stems from the provisions in the constitution about the legislative body's general authority to legislate. Without such explicit authority to limit a constitutional right, a valid implicit authorization may stem from the legal sources that have created the concept of

### ii. Limitation and violation

 A legal provision limiting a constitutional right must constitute a part of the legal system's hierarchical structure. Regardless of its "distance" from the constitution, it must ultimately be connected to an authorization found therein. Conversely, when a provision limiting a constitutional right is not based on such an authorization chain, it constitutes a violation of both the constitution and the constitutional right itself. From a legal perspective, there is no authorization to limit the constitutional right. 13 T us, for example, general policy considerations do not suf ce to form a legal basis to limit a constitutional right – unless they are based on an authorization that may be traced back – directly or indirectly – to the constitution. 14 T e same is true for an administrative regulation limiting constitutional rights. If these limiting administrative regulations are not authorized by a legal provision that is a part of the system's hierarchical structure (such as a statutory provision or a specif c delegated power), these regulations cannot be considered a part of the authorization chain and thus should be invalidated. T erefore, when prisoners are prevented from sending mail from prison solely on the basis of the Department of Correction's regulations (without the ability to link those regulations to a hierarchical legal authority), the prisoner's constitutional right to freedom of expression is limited without proper legal basis. 15 T is is not the case, however, if the same limitation is based on governmental discretion authorized by law, and the administrative regulations are meant only to serve as guidelines for the proper execution of this discretion. In such a case, the authority can be traced back to the enabling legislation and the regulations are seen merely as an aid in guiding the discretion.

proportionality. 12

authorization chain, see below, at 430. 14 See Hof man v. South African Airways , 2001 (1) SA 1. 15 See Committee for the Commonwealth of Canada v. Canada [1991] 1 SCR 139.

 When no legal authority exists to limit a constitutional right, the proportionality of such a limitation is not at issue. Without legal authorization, the limitation is unconstitutional, regardless of its proportionality. A state actor operating in accordance with such unauthorized provision is deprived of the "normative umbrella" of the limitation clause. Accordingly, it may be found personally liable for these actions.

 In Israel, the text of Basic Law: T e Government provides that "[t]he Government is authorized to perform in the name of the State and subject to any law, all actions which are not legally incumbent on another authority." 16 Can such a constitutional provision serve as the legal authority for the limitation of constitutional rights? T e answer is no. T is kind of provision – and all similar provisions – may not be used as a source to limit any right – constitutionally or otherwise. 17

# **B. Statutory limitations**

### 1. Limitation by statute

 Most cases of limitations on constitutional rights are based on statutes enacted by the legislative body. Typically, in these cases, all the legal elements required to properly execute the limitation of a right can be found in the statute itself. Take, for example, a statute determining that "no publication which may af ect national security interests is allowed." Here, all the elements of the limitation on the right of freedom of expression are def ned within the statute. T e scope of the limiting provision is determined according to its interpretation. Such interpretation is performed in accordance with the standard rules of statutory interpretation. 18 T e limiting statute may be formed as a rule or as a principle. T e limitation of the constitutional right may be either implicit or explicit.

 A limitation of a constitutional right by statute is valid only if the statute itself is valid. T is is the case regardless of the type of justif cation provided for this limitation, or lack thereof. It is necessary, therefore, that the

<sup>16</sup> Basic Law: T e Government (Art. 32). 17 See HCJ 1163/03 Supreme Monitoring Committee for Arab Af airs in Israel v. T e Prime Minister of Israel [2006] (1) IsrLR 105, 147 ("It has been held – and this case-law rule has been universally accepted – that the government is not authorized, by virtue of its residual power under the provisions of Section 32, to violate the basic rights of the individual … T e government's 'residual authority' may not serve as a legal source for af ecting the liberty of any individual." (Cheshin, V.P.)). 18 See Barak, above note 10, at 339.

limiting statute pass all the procedural hurdles required, for it to become a valid law. T us, if a bill requires three readings to become a law (as is the case in Israel), a failure of any one of those votes should lead to the invalidation of the entire statute. 19 T e same is true if the vote did not pass with the required majority, or if a required majority was obtained through fraud, as in the case of "double" votes (i.e., where one Member of Parliament votes for two). 20 Similarly, in a federal legal system a bill must abide by state or federal procedural requirements to become a valid law. A failure to abide by any of these requirements creates a break in the authorization chain, which in turn leads to the invalidation of the limiting statute. T e question of proportionality, therefore, is not reached in those cases.

### 2. Limitation according to statute

### i. T e intensity of the statutory delegation

 A limitation on a constitutional right is according to statute when the statute in question does not contain all the legal elements required to properly execute such a limitation. Many legal instances fall into this category. T ese "def cient" statutes dif er in degree regarding the extent of the intensity in determining the elements of the sub-constitutional law. Some contain more of the required limitation elements, while others contain less; in all of these cases, the other limiting elements are found in a sub-statutory law (such as an executive or administrative regulation). T us we can imagine a spectrum of "def cient" limiting statutes. On one end of the spectrum we f nd the limitations in which most of the legal fundamentals that make them up are detailed in the statute, with only minor elements lef to be addressed by the sub-statutory norm. On the other end we f nd statutes that authorize a sub-statutory authority to decide most of the limiting elements. Between these two extremes we f nd many intermediate, or "hybrid," situations. Take, for example, a statutory provision requiring a license to practice certain occupations (physicians or lawyers, for example). Assume the provision also states that the executive branch – specif cally, the department in charge of regulating such occupations – would determine the exact requirements needed to obtain such a license. In this example, the statutory provision contains

<sup>19</sup> See HCJ 5131/03 Litzman v. Knesset Speaker [2004] IsrSC 59(1) 577, available in English at http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les_eng/03/310/051/A04/03051310.a04.pdf . 20 Ibid .

only some of the elements required for executing a limitation on the constitutional right (here, the right to freedom of occupation), while the rest of the elements required – the exact conditions for granting or refusing a license – are determined by administrative (or executive) regulations. T e issue likely to arise in these situations is whether such a "minimal" statutory provision is suf cient to overcome the requirement that the limitation on a constitutional right be according to statute. T ese issues will now be examined.

### ii. Limitations on the statutory delegation's intensity

 In principle, no constitutional issue arises when some of the elements required to properly execute a limitation on a constitutional right are found in a sub-statutory norm (such as regulations). However, the question arising from such a principled assertion is as follows: does the legislator have an unfettered discretion to determine the degree of intensity (or scope) of the elements making up the limitation appearing in both statutory and sub-statutory law? Is a legislative determination asserting that a constitutional right may be limited, while leaving the key elements of such a limitation to be determined by regulations, legal? Does it abide by the legality-principle requirement of the limitation clause?

T e answer to this question changes from one legal system to another. Some legal systems support the view that primary arrangements regarding a limitation of constitutional rights must appear in the statute itself and not in a sub-statutory norm (the non-delegable doctrine). T is is the case in the United States, 21 Germany, 22 Canada, 23 India, 24 and Israel. 25 Primary arrangements are arrangements setting the general policy as well as the leading principles. 26 T e constitutional basis for this view is supported by the constitutional principles of separation of powers, the rule of law, and democracy itself. According to the separation of powers principle, the delegation of regulating authority to the executive branch is allowed, but only if the legislative branch determines the parameters

within which the executive branch may operate. 27 T e rule-of-law principle requires, in turn, that the legislative branch determine the principles or primary arrangements, while the administrative (or executive) branch only be allowed to determine, through regulations, the details of such arrangements ("secondary arrangements"). As for the notion of democracy, it requires that substantial resolutions be made through the duly elected representatives sitting in the legislative body, and not by delegation to non-elected of cials.

T e conclusion is that a statute which delegates to an administrative agency (or another executive body) the authority to limit a constitutional right without determining the primary arrangements relating to the content of said limitation is invalid. T e nature of the limited right, its place in the hierarchy of rights, and the scope of the limitation are all of no consequence to this conclusion. Conversely, when the statute does determine the primary arrangements of the limitation, there is no legal objection to the secondary arrangements being determined either by regulations or through the exercise of other executive (or administrative) authority.

### iii. General authorization

 Some constitutions require that limitations on constitutional rights rely on a law with "general application." T e German Constitution, for example, requires that any limiting legislation "apply generally and not solely to an individual case." 28 T is requirement, therefore, calls for the general application of the limiting legislation, rather than for a limited application to an individual case. A similar provision, inf uenced by its German counterpart, appears in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa: "T e rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application." 29 Even when the limitation clause – whether included in a constitution or an international treaty – does not specify the requirement for "general" application, it has been at times interpreted that the "generality" requirement still applies. 30

Kiss, "Permissible Limitations on Rights," in L. Henkin (ed.), T e International Bill of Rights: T e Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (New York: Columbia University Press, 1981), 290, 308.

T e "generality" requirement is consistent with – and is in fact a part of – the rule-of-law principle. 31 Some view the generality requirement as part of the separation of powers principle. 32 According to this explanation, a special legislative act dedicated to a specif c individual, or to a specif c matter, represents an undue intervention in matters of the executive branch (if the matter is of an administrative nature) or of the judicial branch (if the matter is of a judicial nature) without abiding by all the requirements justifying such a legislative intervention. T is is the basis for the American constitutional prohibition on Bills of Attainder, 33 which are "legislative acts, no matter their form, that apply to either named individuals or easily ascertainable members of a group in such a way as to inf ict punishment on them without a judicial trial." 34 Still others base the "generality" requirement on the principle of equality before the law. According to this view, a legislation arbitrarily limiting a constitutional right is unconstitutional as it does not fulf ll the requirement that the constitutional right's limitation be prescribed by law.

T e dif erent explanations as to the analytical basis of the "generality" requirement lead, in most cases, to the same interpretive result – in most, but not all, cases. Take, for example, the equality rationale. If the main reason behind the "generality" requirement is to guarantee equality, then a specif c statute (applying to a specif c individual) may not limit, in some cases, equality itself. T is is the case when legal justif cations exist, according to the principle of equality itself, to provide dif erent (legal) treatments to dif erent members of a given community. T e result would be dif erent, in these cases, if the rationale behind the requirement was related to either the rule-of-law or the separation-of-powers principles.

 In any event, it seems that subscribers to the dif erent rationales behind the "generality" requirement would agree on the following three

propositions. First, the substance, and not the wording, of the limiting legislation is the deciding factor. What may appear as a "general" limitation according to its wording may turn out to be a law which applies to an individual in substance. Such limitations could not be considered "general" for purposes of the constitutional requirement. Second, the "generality" requirement is not satisf ed whenever the limiting legislation applies to a known and easily identif ed group of people. T e dividing line between a known and easily identif ed group (which violates the "generality" requirement) and a group that is not known and not easily identif ed may, however, be hard to establish in some cases. T ird, in determining the line between individual law (prohibited by the requirement) and "general" law (required by the limitation clause), the interpreter may need to address the reasons behind the legislation. 35

 It may be claimed that, with the rise of the status of the constitutional right to equality, the generality requirement becomes less important. According to this claim, most cases where a law, limiting a constitutional right, is unconstitutional due to its lack of generality will also be unconstitutional due to its limitation of equality. However, the generality requirement retains its importance as a threshold requirement, for two reasons. First, not every case of "non-generality" stems from discrimination; second, if the limiting statute does not realize the generality requirement, there is no need to examine its proportionality. Surely, without generality's threshold requirements a limitation of equality does not suf ce, and there is a need to examine the proportionality of equality's limitation. From here stems the importance of the generality requirement in legal systems where the principle of equality is developed.

### iv. "Accessible" authorization

 Many legal systems share the notion that any law authorizing a limitation of a constitutional right must be "accessible" to the public. 36 It should be public domain. Accordingly, the statute should be published. A "secret law" or regulations with legislative powers promulgated behind closed doors are not accessible, and are therefore unconstitutional. 37

<sup>35</sup> See Van der Schyf , above note 1, at 139. 36 See Sunday Times v. United Kingdom , above note 6; Dawood v. Minster of Home Af airs ,

above note 31; President of the Republic of South Africa v. Hugo , 1997 (4) SA 1 (CC). 37 LCRA 1127/93 State of Israel v. Klein [1994] IsrSC 48(3) 485, 515 ("T e principle of public legislation is at the heart of hearts of the rule of law … T is element of the publication of statutory provisions penetrates deep into the kingdom of the rule of law in its substantive aspect – both in terms of content and value – which is the rule of law as steeped in the fundamental values of society and of the individual." (Cheshin, J.)).

 A similar question arises regarding internal guidelines of the executive branch: if they are authorized by primary legislation, are they also required to abide by the publicity requirement? T e answer is yes. T e publicity requirement is satisf ed if, and only if, these internal regulations are accessible to the public. Similarly, a judicial decision is considered "public" only if it is properly, and openly, published. T is accessibility requirement is also aimed at any authorizing (or delegating) law. An individual directive, authorized by law, is not required to be public; only the authorizing law itself must be public and accessible. It would be suf cient for the individual directive to be brought to the attention of the person against whom it was issued. Some are of the opinion that legislation cannot limit rights retroactively. Retroactive (or retrospective) law is not accessible as the limitation did not exist when the action took place and was obviously not accessible. 38 It seems that a retrospective, or retroactive, law limiting a constitutional right is accessible if published properly. Its constitutionality should be determined, therefore, according to a set of well-determined legal criteria rather than a simple threshold test.

### v. Suf ciently clear authorization

 Some courts have ruled that in order to satisfy the requirement of "prescribed by law" the limiting law should be "clear enough." 39 A limiting law, in other words, should be comprehensible to a reasonable reader (including, if need be, with the assistance of a professional to reach this comprehension). Otherwise, the statutory arrangement is the functional equivalent of a "secret law." T e law is not a riddle. On the other hand, the more complex the issue is, the more complex the legal arrangement. T e law is not a simple arithmetic equation, either. T e clarity required is relative to the complexity of the issue at hand. 40 T e proper criterion is that of reasonable understanding, one that would enable reasonable people to guide their future actions (even, if need be, with the help of a professional). T e European Court of Human Rights noted this point in the Sunday Times case:

> [A] norm cannot be regarded as "law" unless it is formulated with suf cient precision to enable the citizen to regulate his conduct; he must be able – if need be with appropriate advice – to foresee, to a degree that is

<sup>38</sup> See, e.g., Currie, above note 3, at 169.

<sup>39</sup> See Van der Schyf , above note 1, at 140, 180, 245; Woolman and Botha, above note 31, at 49. 40 See Chorherr v. Austria , App. No. 13308/87, 17 EHRR 358 (1994).

reasonable in the circumstances, the consequences which a given action may entail. T ose consequences need not be foreseeable with absolute certainty; experience shows this to be unattainable. Again, whilst certainty is highly desirable, it may bring in its train excessive rigidity and the law must be able to keep pace with changing circumstances. Accordingly, many laws are inevitably couched in terms which, to a greater or lesser extent, are vague and whose interpretation and application are questions of practice. 41

 Accordingly, for example, if the statute determines the conditions under which the government may legally eavesdrop, every informed person – including the person to whom the government is secretly listening – should be able to discern these conditions, even if he has no idea that his own rights are limited in this way. 42

 Some legal systems adopted the doctrine of unconstitutional " vagueness." According to the doctrine, a statutory provision limiting a constitutional right is void if it is too "vague." 43 T e doctrine of vagueness may well be seen as an integral part of the general requirement of the constitutional limitation to be "clear enough." It is important to note that the level of clarity required – or rather the level of lack of clarity that would render the limiting provision void – would apply regardless of the degree of proportionality of the limiting provision. Accordingly, a provision is clear if it sets a clear arrangement to the limitation of a constitutional right, even if the limitation turns out not to be proportional. Clarity is separate from proportionality. Clarity is a threshold requirement.

 What is the level of clarity required by the constitution for the limiting provision? T e answer may change from one legal system to the next. However, generally speaking, the clarity required should not be such that a mere initial reading would provide the exact contours of constitutional limitation; such a requirement cannot be met by most constitutional democracies (assuming, arguendo , that they aimed at meeting such a requirement in the f rst place). Indeed, most initial readings are intuitive. 44 T ey attach a substantial weight to the dictionary meaning of the legal text. T e legal system as a whole, however, is a much more nuanced and complex

<sup>41</sup> See Sunday Times , above note 6, at para. 49. 42 See Malone v. United Kingdom , App. No. 8691/79, 7 EHRR 14 (1984). 43 See generally Hogg, above note 3, at 125.

Rev . 487 ( 1994 ); J. Waldron, "Vagueness in Law and Language: Some Philosophical Issues," 82 Calif. L. Rev . 509 ( 1994 ); J. E. Nowak and R. D. Rotunda, Constitutional Law , 8th edn.

creature. Accordingly, the rules of statutory interpretation have evolved over hundreds of years. A legal text cannot be understood without the process of legal interpretation, 45 and no pre-interpretive understanding can stand. 46 T erefore, the clarity required is the clarity achieved af er the interpretive process has been exhausted. Every text is clear and understandable – in relation to the legal issues in question – af er the interpretive process has been completed. T ere is no text that is un-interpretable; there is no text which the process of legal interpretation does not render, at the end of the day, clear and lucid as to the legal issues in question. We may therefore conclude that the level of lack of clarity required to render the limiting provision unconstitutional is extreme. T is occurs only in those (rare) cases where an educated reading of the provision, including the application of all the rules of statutory interpretation by a professional, still leaves the reader with serious doubt as to its legal meaning. 47 In those cases – and only in those cases – we should determine that the limiting provision is not clear enough.

# **C. Te legality principle and common law**

## 1. T e constitution and common law

 Most common law legal systems draf ed their constitutions within the context of an existing – and sometimes long-standing – common law regime. It is only natural, therefore, that one of the f rst questions to arise in those systems was that of the proper relation between the common law – developed either prior to the constitution or post that date – and the constitution itself. Can a constitutional democracy tolerate the common law? Can the common law limit a constitutional right? Legislation limiting constitutional rights is constitutional – and valid – if it abides by the requirements of the limitation clause – in other words, if it is proportional. Can a court decision be treated the same way? Should the courts be asked to abide by the same requirements posed by the limitation clause? Should they be proportional? Constitutions sometimes determine that every state authority must respect constitutional rights. 48 If it is agreed that the judiciary is a state authority, it must respect constitutional rights.

<sup>45</sup> Ibid ., at 12. 46 Ibid . 47 See, in Canada, R . v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society [1992] 2 SCR 606. 48 See Art. 1(2) of the German Grundgesetz ; Art. 7(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa; Art. 11 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty.

When the court develops the common law in the f eld of private law it at times takes rights from one and gives them to the other. T is is the case in contract law and tort. Such common law will usually limit an individual's rights vis- à-vis the state. Such limitation was carried out by a state authority – for example, the judiciary. If this limitation had been carried out through statute, it would be unconstitutional – unless it fulf lls the requirements in the limitation clause. Should the common law which created these rights in private law – and therefore also limits those rights visà-vis the state – fulf ll the requirement of the limitation clause?

 Despite its signif cance, this book cannot give this issue its due treatment. Instead, the following pages will present an initial sketch of the major considerations involved. It begins by noting that providing a positive answer to the question – requiring common law decisions to abide by the requirements posed by the limitation clause – is essential to any legal system that would like to continue existing as a common law system. Indeed, if the common law, by developing rights between individuals, cannot limit an individual's constitutional right vis-à-vis the state, its function as a creative common law – which is separate from its role in statutory and constitutional interpretation – is severely harmed.

 How could we ensure, therefore, the status of the common law as a viable source of law in a constitutional democracy? 49 Without an express constitutional directive, 50 the answer lies in legal tradition. In most common law systems, the rule of recognition – to use Hart's term 51 – accepts the authority of the common law to create new law. But what is the case when the legal system is governed by a formal constitution? What then is the legal source of common law authority? For some, the question should be reversed, as legal authority of the constitution

view, parliamentary sovereignty does not draw its authority from the common law. 55

T e gap between these two approaches is considerable. Albeit, in practice, it is narrower than it f rst appears to be. T ose of the f rst opinion limit the common law's power, compared to the constitution, to extreme cases where the constitution limits the law's essential elements as established in the common law. 56 T ose of the second opinion are, at times, willing to recognize the limitations applicable to the constitution stemming from external principles. T e gap between the two approaches is, therefore, expressed in the shaping of basic and essential principles that even the constitution must uphold.

 It is therefore possible to conclude – as per both approaches – that in regular cases – those that do not fall into the category of basic and essential principles – the authority of the common law to limit the constitutional right as well as protect it should be found within the constitution itself, whether explicitly or implicitly. According to this approach, the common law's authority to limit and protect the constitutional right is found in the limitation clause (explicitly or implicitly). Indeed, the limitation clause may serve as the legal source for the continued power of the common law in a constitutional democracy.

### 2. T e common law and the limitation clause

### i. Common law as a law limiting constitutional rights

T e limitation clause (either explicit or implicit) may be seen as the legal source of the common law's authority to limit and protect rights in a constitutional democracy. Indeed, many constitutional limitation clauses in common law systems provide that a limitation of rights is only valid if prescribed by "law," a term those systems consider to include the common law. 57 T is view was initially espoused by the European Court of Human Rights in the Sunday Times case. 58 T ere, the House of Lords issued an injunction against the publication of a newspaper article relating to a

pending case in England. T e injunction was based, among others, on the English common law concept of "contempt of court." T e European Court was asked to decide whether such a common law concept may properly limit the constitutional right to freedom of expression, guaranteed by Article 10(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. No one disputed that the English ruling had the ef ect of limiting the right; the only question before the European Court was whether this limitation is proper, that is, whether it abides by all the requirement of the Convention's specif c limitation clause (Article 10(2)). T e limitation clause determines that the limitation has to be "prescribed by law." 59 Is the common law included in that term? T e European Court ruled that it was. As the Court explained:

> T e Court observes that the word "law" in the expression "prescribed by law" covers not only statute but also unwritten law. Accordingly, the Court does not attach importance here to the fact that contempt of court is a creature of the common law and not of legislation. It would clearly be contrary to the intention of the draf ers of the Convention to hold that a restriction imposed by virtue of the common law is not "prescribed by law" on the sole ground that it is not enunciated in legislation; this would deprive a common-law state which is Party to the Convention of the protection of Article 10(2) and strikes at the very roots of that state's legal system. 60

 Other courts in common law systems have reached similar results. 61 Referring to the limitation clause included in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa , Judge Kriegler wrote:

> [T e clause] draws no distinction between dif erent categories of law of general application … A rule of the common law which, for example, infringes on a person's right to privacy or human dignity can be saved if it meets the Section 33(1) requirements. And it is irrelevant whether such rule is statutory, regulatory, horizontal, or vertical, and it matters not whether it is founded on the XII Tables of Roman Law, a Placaet of Holland or a tribal custom. 62

 When the courts develop the common law by granting rights to one individual vis-à-vis another (e.g., contracts, torts), the state acts. T is action af ects the rights of individuals vis-à-vis the state. T us, by developing a common law rule about libel, the courts are limiting the right to freedom of expression of the individual vis-à-vis the state. 63 T e common law is a state action just as legislation is a state action. Both are "law," both may af ect the constitutional rights of individuals vis-à-vis the state, and, in both cases, the constitutionality of those laws should be decided according to limitation clauses. In both cases, the law must be proportional. It does not seem right to me that, while a statute that limits the constitutional rights of the individual vis-à-vis the state is subject to proportionality requirements, a common law decision with the same ef ect is not subject to proportionality requirements. 64 One should note that my view is not based on the assumption that the constitutional rights operate vis-àvis individuals (horizontally). It is based on the assumption that constitutional rights operate only vis-à-vis the state. However, when the common law is providing rights between individuals – rights that operate on the sub-constitutional level only – such common law activity af ects also the constitutional rights of the individuals vis-à-vis the state. T e limitation on their constitutional rights vis-à-vis the state is prescribed by common law. T is common law must be proportional in order to be constitutional. One should note that the scope of the individual's constitutional right vis-à-vis the state is more expansive than the individual's right vis-à-vis another individual. T e reason for this is that in determining the scope of the individual's constitutional right vis-à-vis the state, one should consider the rationale of the right's basis. 65 No balance should be made on the constitutional level between it and the considerations which justify the right's limitation (i.e., the public interest or the rights of others). 66 Balances should be made only when determining the constitutionality of the limitation of the constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law.67 With regard to the determination of the common law right of one individual vis-à-vis another individual, the scope of the right is determined by the common law and is a product of the balancing between the rationale at the right's basis and the rationale at the basis of the constitutional rights of others or the public interest. Of course, the constitutionality of this

<sup>65</sup> See above, at 71. 66 See above, at 75. 67 See below, at 340.

balance is determined by the limitation clause. T is sub-constitutional common law is constitutional only if it is proportional.

# ii. T e dif culties in applying a limitation clause to common law

T e application of the limitation clause's provisions to the common law is far from easy. T ree main dif culties will be noted here. T e f rst issue is that limitation clauses are mostly created – and then interpreted by courts – with limiting legislative provisions in mind – hence, the constitutional requirements of accessibility, clarity, proper purpose, and the use of proportional means to achieve those purposes. T ese requirements, as formal requirements, are foreign to the common law. T e common law has rarely evolved in that manner in the past; the addition of such threshold requirements under a constitutional regime may impose a heavy burden on its development. 68 However, constitutional provisions may not be ignored, even when they impose "heavy burdens." T e common law should not be given any "special treatment" compared with legislation. 69 T e approach applied to legislation which limits the constitutional right must be applied with regard to case law limiting a constitutional right. Accordingly, the common law must abide by them. T erefore, amongst other conditions, common law judgments must be properly published; the law stemming from them must be clear and unequivocal; the purposes these rulings seek to advance must be proper; and the means used by those precedents to achieve those purposes must be proportional as well. T e constitutional experience of several common law countries demonstrates that, despite the dif culties, such requirements are plausible.

T e second dif culty in applying the limitation clause to the common law lies in the " presumption of legality" of executive action. T is presumption is a basic principle of administrative law in many common law systems. 70 Does the presumption of legality support the idea that constitutional rights can be limited not only by statute but also by the common law precedents? T e answer is that it does. T e presumption of legality "f ts in" well with common law limitations on constitutional rights. T e reason for that is that, in common law systems, judicial decisions are a valid legal source. T ey are part and parcel of the prevailing

<sup>68</sup> See Hogg, above note 3, at 159.

<sup>69</sup> See Hill v. Church of Scientology [1995] 2 SCR 1130, where Justice Cory ruled that the rules of proportionality need to be used in a more f exible manner where the limitation of the constitutional right is done by the common law. 70 See D. Foulkes, Administrative Law , 8th edn. (London: Butterworths, 1995 ), 53.

positive law. Common law has undergone major changes over the years in that respect. 71 Initially, general judicial rules of administrative law were viewed as merely statutory-interpretation products rather than an independent source of law. T us, for example, the basic rules relating to fair hearing and conf ict of interest were seen as deriving from the relevant statutory provisions. However, over the years, the close connection between the common law and legislation weakened, until it f nally withered away. Common law has been recognized as an independent source of law, regardless of the accompanying legislation. And, since judges were no longer tied to any statutory provision in order to develop those rules, their authority no longer depended upon legislative delegation. Finally, with the constitutionalization of many of the common law legal systems, we now view the constitution itself as the legal source of the common law. Regarding the limitation clause, it is suf cient that the constitution is recognized as the legal source of the authority exercised by common law judges to continue developing general principles of administrative law. As such a legal source is constitutional, it can therefore also allow for the limitation of constitutional rights, whether explicitly or implicitly recognized. In that respect, the "presumption of legality" of executive actions must include the common law as a source of authority. In other words, the "presumption of legality" does not require that every executive action originate with a statutory authority; rather, such a presumption – much like the rule-of-law principle, of which it is a part – merely requires that every executive action must be legal (and is in fact presumed to be that way until shown otherwise). In a common law system, the term "law" encompasses the common law in addition to statutory law.

T e third dif culty in applying the limitation clause to the common law lies in the notion that most constitutional rights are primarily directed at the state and not towards other individuals. T at said, if the judicial branch is included within the state, the result may be that constitutional rights can operate between private parties to a legal dispute. 72 T is result is achieved through the dual role played by the courts in a constitutional democracy: On the one hand, a court settles a private law dispute according to the rules of private law (contracts, torts, and the like). On the other hand, when doing so, the court may limit the constitutional right of one of the parties, which originally operated only vis-à-vis the state. Take the case of Joe Smith, who claims that a publication by Jane Doe damaged his

reputation. T is is a dispute within the conf nes of private law (here, the law of libel). Joe's right to privacy, as well as Jane's right to free speech, are both recognized within the spheres of private law, and therefore may be exercised against each other. None of these parties, however, has a constitutional right vis-à-vis the other. T e constitutional rights operate usually vis-à-vis the state. 73 But now consider the role of the judicial branch. T is branch's acknowledgment of one party's common law right to limit another's common law right – a valid acknowledgment within the conf nes of common law – may concomitantly constitute a limitation on one party's (or both) constitutional right vis-à-vis the state. T e constitutionality of this limitation would have to be determined according to the rules of proportionality provided by the limitation clause. T e result, in practice, is that the right of one party (Joe Smith) vis-à-vis another party (Jane Doe) within the conf nes of private law has turned – through the intervention of the judicial branch – into a constitutional right that may be exercised against another person.

T e answer to the third dif culty is that, in my opinion, constitutional rights apply directly only vis-à-vis the state. 74 T ey do not apply directly to the relationships governed by private law. According to this point of view, Joe Smith cannot argue that Jane Doe has af ected his constitutional right not to be defamed. All Joe Smith can argue is that his private law right vis-à-vis Jane Doe not to be defamed has been limited. However, the constitutional right of individuals vis-à-vis the state may af ect the content of private law. T e constitutional right vis-à-vis the state of freedom of expression may be limited by a common law rule on libel. In such a case, the common law limitation is constitutional only if it is proportional. A proportional common law creates direct rights between individuals. However, these rights are not constitutional, but rather subconstitutional rights. 75 T ose sub-constitutional rights are the of spring

of the conf ict between constitutional rights. Even if the constitution provides – as does the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa 76 – that constitutional rights apply directly between individuals, such application will need prescriptive content provided by sub-constitutional laws. 77 Such laws will ref ect the proportional limitation on the conf icting rights. T us, Joe Smith's constitutional right vis-à-vis Jane Doe under the South African Bill of Rights to his good reputation will conf ict with Jane Doe's constitutional right vis-à-vis Joe Smith to freedom of expression. T is conf ict will not be resolved on the constitutional level. 78 Rather, it will be resolved on the sub-constitutional level (common law) that will fulf ll the proportionality requirement. T us, though the horizontal application of constitutional rights in South Africa creates a direct relationship among individuals, this direct relationship is operative on the sub-constitutional level. T erefore, there is no place for special constitutional remedies for breach of those rights. T e place for the remedies is on the sub-constitutional level (private law).

 It follows, that the question of the vertical or horizontal application of the constitutional rights do not af ect the proposition that the limitation clause (proportionality) applies to the common law. T e common law is sub-constitutional law. It establishes direct common law rights between individuals. T ose rights ef ect the individual constitutional rights vis-àvis the state. In order for that ef ect to be constitutional, it must be proportional. T e provision of the limitation clause, that limits on constitutional rights must be by law, and that the law must be proportional, applies also to the common law. It applies to common law that grants power to the state; it applies to common law that establishes rights and duties between individuals. In both cases, the common law af ects the rights of the individual vis-à-vis the state, and therefore must be proportional according to the provisions of the limitation clause.

# T e nature and function of proportionality

# **A. Te nature of proportionality**

### 1. Proportionality and its components

 At the foundation of the modern understanding of human rights is the distinction between the scope of the constitutional right (as determined by the constitution) and the justif cation for its limitation which determines the extent of its protection or realization (as determined by sub-constitutional norms). 1 In the f rst part of this book, the f rst component of the distinction was discussed – the scope of the constitutional right. It was emphasized that most constitutional rights are relative – there is justif cation for not realizing them to the full extent of their scope. T e criterion by which such a realization is measured is that of proportionality. T is part of the book examines the nature, role, and sources (both legal and historical) of proportionality. It is assumed that the constitutional right in question has been limited by a sub-constitutional law (such as a statute or the common law). T e issue presented, therefore, is what is the basis – both formal and substantive – of this limitation? T e answer is that this basis can be found in proportionality, located in the limitation clause (whether explicit or implicit) in the constitution.

 Proportionality is a legal construction. It is a methodological tool. It is made up of four components: proper purpose, rational connection, necessary means, and a proper relation between the benef t gained by realizing the proper purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right (the last component is also called "proportionality stricto sensu " (balancing)). T ese four components are the core of the limitation clause. T ey are crucial to the understanding of proportionality. T e limiting law must uphold these four components in order to pass constitutional muster.

> 1 See above, at 19.

T ese components render the otherwise abstract notion of proportionality into a more concrete, usable concept.

T is aggregate approach – which requires all four components in each case that a constitutional right is limited – has been adopted by a signif cant number of countries. It ref ects a structured approach to the notion of proportionality. 2 However, some legal systems have adopted a "sof er" approach. Some emphasize only three of the four components – such as proper purpose, rational connection, and a proper relation between the fulf llment of the purpose and the damage to the constitutional right. 3 Others consider these tests to be recommendations rather than constitutionally mandated requirements. 4 T e structured approach is the most suitable. It provides proportionality with concrete content and adequate protection to the limited constitutional rights. 5

 Typically, proportionality is described as a criterion determining the proper relation between the aims and the means. T is description may be misleading. It may suggest that the only relevant factors in considering proportionality are the purposes and the means chosen to achieve it; this is not accurate. T e means chosen are not only examined in relation to the purpose they were meant to achieve; they are also examined in relation to the constitutional right. T ey provide the justif cation for limiting the right. Only means that can sustain both examinations are proper means. Only when the social importance of the benef t in realizing the proper purpose is greater than the social importance of preventing the harm caused by limiting the right, can we say that such a limitation is proportional. T us, proportionality examines the purpose of the means, the constitutional right, and the proper relationship between them.

T e proper relationship between the social importance of the benef t in realizing the purpose and the social importance of preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right is expressed dif erently in dif erent constitutions. In some cases, the constitutional text demands that the

<sup>3</sup> T is was the approach adopted in France. See Decision No. 2007–555 DC (August 16, 2007). Lately, however, it seems that the French Constitutional Court has adopted a new approach, requiring the necessary means test as well. See Decision No. 2008–562 (February 21, 2008); Decision No. 2009–580 (June 10, 2009).

limitation of the constitutional right be "necessary" 6 or "reasonable" 7 in a democratic society. T ese and other, similar terms have of en been interpreted as the proportionality requirement. As President Chaskalson of the Constitutional Court of South Africa in the Makwanyane case well observed:

> T e limitation of constitutional rights for a purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a democratic society involves the weighing up of competing values, and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality. 8

### 2. Dif erent methods of limiting constitutional rights

T ere are several ways to limit a constitutional right. No unif ed approach has been adopted by all constitutions. 9 Instead, the relevant provisions set up in the dif erent constitutions are usually a ref ection of the unique historical background of each legal system. We are thus faced with a spectrum of constitutional solutions regarding limitations. On one end of the spectrum we might f nd a constitution def ning several human rights without providing any mechanism for their limitation. Such is the case of the American Constitution in relation to the First Amendment rights of freedom of expression and free exercise of religion. 10 On the other end of the spectrum we might f nd a constitution which def nes the rights in "absolute" terms alongside a general limitation clause which applies to all those rights. T is is the approach adopted by Canada, South Africa, and Israel. 11 Between these two extremes are a plethora of constitutional arrangements. Some contain no general limitation clause, but rather a specif c limitation clause for specif c constitutional rights. 12 Some contain both general and specif c limitation clauses. 13 Some contain no

general limitation clause, with some rights accompanied by specif c limitation clauses while other rights are not. Indeed, each legal system ultimately decides for itself which is the best way to either allow or prevent the limitation of constitutional rights. Every legal system has its own way of acknowledging the relativity of constitutional human rights. 14

# 3. T e "silent constitution" and limitation of rights

# i. Implied (or judge-made) limitation clause

T e inclusion of an express limitation clause in a constitution indicates the relative nature of the rights to which it applies. But is the opposite true as well? Does the non-inclusion of an express limitation clause (neither general nor specif c) indicate the absolute nature of those rights? Are all rights included in constitutions without express limitation clauses – "silent constitutions" – absolute? Take, for example, Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms: 15

> In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.

T is provision is interpreted as granting a right to access the courts in civil matters. 16 Can this right be limited? Note that Article 6(1) does

not contain a specif c limitation clause. T e European Convention does not contain a general limitation clause. Despite that, it was held that the authority to limit the right to access is well recognized. 17 A similar approach was adopted regarding Article 3 of the First Protocol to the European Convention, which requires that the contracting states provide "free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot, under conditions which will ensure the free expression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature." T e European Court of Human Rights interpreted this provision as guaranteeing a general right to vote and to be elected. T e court added, however, that these rights are not absolute and are bound by the implied limitation clause. 18 T is kind of limitation may be aptly characterized as either implied or judge-made. T e Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany also contains some rights unaccompanied by a limitation clause. 19 T e courts pronounce that these rights contain implied or immanent limitations. Accordingly, some limitation clauses "may be found within the explicit text of the constitution, while others are the result of judicial enterprise." 20

T e view adopted by most legal systems is that the constitution's silence regarding limitation clauses (general or specif c) does not render the constitutional rights absolute. T is conclusion is interpretive in nature. T is stems from the interpretation of the constitution as a whole. 21 T e proper approach is to recognize those rights as part of the entire constitutional framework. T ey must, therefore, be interpreted in harmony with the constitution's other provisions. T is kind of interpretation gives rise to a constitutionally implied or immanent limit to those rights, stemming from the very nature of those rights as part of the framework of a democratic society. 22 T e relative nature of constitutional rights is inherent to

democracy. Accordingly, a constitution striving to prevent the limitation of a human right must provide so explicitly. T us, for example, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides, regarding the principle of human dignity (Article 1(1)):

Human dignity shall be inviolable. 23

 Following the text of this provision, as well as the status granted to the right to human dignity by the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany – a status preventing any future amendments to the right ("eternal provision") 24 – German court rulings have recognized the absolute nature of that right. 25 T is, however, is the exception. In most cases, the interpretation provided by the courts to constitutional rights asserts their relative nature. T e courts have acknowledged that constitutional rights are relative, in other words, they may be limited.

T e prevailing view in comparative constitutional law is that, alongside explicit limitations, implicit limitations are recognized as well. 26 An implicit limitation on a constitutional right is treated in the same manner – and has the same constitutional status – as an explicit limitation. Both do not af ect the scope of the right, but only the extent of its protection – the way the right is realized. 27 T erefore, the implicit limitation operates as a part of the two-stage structure of the constitutional analysis,

- 23 T e term "inviolable" was adopted by the of cial German translation of the following German original text: "Die W ü rde des Menschen ist unantastbar." In my opinion, this is an unfortunate translation. T e same term appears in the translation of Art. 4(1), despite the fact that the original text uses a dif erent term, providing that the freedoms of faith and conscience shall be " uverletzlich ." Here the term "inviolable" is more appropriate. T e proper translation of the f rst term, however, should be "sacrosanct" or
"untouchable." 24 Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Art. 79(3) ("Amendments to this Basic Law af ecting the … principles laid down in Articles 1 … shall be inadmissible."). 25 See above, at 31.

- 26 See G. Van der Schyf , Limitation of Rights: A Study of the European Convention and South African Bill of Rights (Nijmegen, T e Netherlands: Wolf Legal Publishers, 2005), 127 ("[A] limitation provision may be in written form or in unwritten form."). Robert Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (Julian Rivers trans., 2002 [1986]), 188; M. Rautenbach and E. F. J. Malherbe, Constitutional Law , 4th edn. (Durban: Butterworths, 2004), 315. For a dif erent view, see I. Leigh, "Taking Rights Proportionately: Judicial
Review, the Human Rights Act and Strasbourg" PL 265 ( 2002 ). 27 For a dif erent view, see A. Kavanagh, Constitutional Review under the UK Human Rights Act (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 262: "With respect to the so-called 'unqualif ed rights' there is no formal division into two dif erent steps. However, in seeking to establish whether the right has been violated, the courts assess whether the alleged violation is so severe that it can be said to go beyond the scope of the right."

acting as an explicit limitation clause would. 28 T e conclusion relating to the existence of an implicit limitation clause is interpretive in nature. T e conclusion would be the opposite should the interpretive process point to a "negative solution" by the text. 29 In most legal systems, however, the very existence of an explicit limitation clause for some rights does not suggest a "negative solution" with regard to the existence of implicit limitation clauses to other rights. Furthermore, the constitution's silence regarding the existence of a limitation clause should not be interpreted as a gap – or lacuna – needing to be f lled. T e judicial recognition of an implicit limitation clause, therefore, is not a gap-f lling activity. T ose implicit clauses are written into the constitution with an invisible ink. T ey are implicit of the nature of the existing text. T ey are a part of the constitutional text. 30

T e components of the implicit limitation clause are not necessarily identical to those of the explicit limitation clause. T e recognized approach is that the proportionality requirement applies both on explicit and implicit limitations. T e main dif erence between the two can be found in the purposes justifying the limitation. In the absence of a special constitutional provision relating to "proper purposes," the legitimacy of the limitation is measured against the general provisions of the constitution, either explicit or implicit. 31 Accordingly, a constitutional right not accompanied by a limitation clause (neither general nor specif c) can be limited to realize the purpose of protecting other human rights enumerated in the constitution. Similarly, a right may be limited to realize other purposes protected (either explicitly or implicitly) by the constitution. As the German Constitutional Court noted:

> Having due regard for the unity of the Constitution and the entire values protected by it, conf icting constitutional rights of third parties and other legal values of constitutional status … are capable, in exceptional circumstances, of limiting unqualif ed constitutional rights. 32

### ii. Implied limitation clause in US constitutional law

T e Bill of Rights included in the American Constitution contains a list of constitutional rights. On the surface, some of those rights seem abso-

lute. A typical example is the First Amendment, which provides, among others:

Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech. 33

T is provision is not accompanied by an explicit limitation clause. Similarly, the Bill of Rights has no general limitation clause. Despite that, in a long and consistent line of cases, the US Supreme Court has ruled inter alia that the right to freedom of speech may be limited by an act of Congress, provided that such an act was designed to achieve a compelling state interest or a pressing public necessity or a substantial state interest, and the means designated by such an act were "necessary," that is, "narrowly tailored" to achieve those ends. Such acts were held to be constitutional. 34 How should those rulings be considered in relation to the right itself? Should it be seen as though it has determined the scope of the right to freedom of expression? T is view asserts that the right is protected to its fullest extent; that extent (or scope), however, was narrowed by judicial interpretation. According to another view, these rulings had nothing to do with the scope of the right; rather, they have prescribed (judicial) limitations on the rights' realization. T us, the scope of the right was not af ected by the ruling, but rather they provided the criterion by which the right may be realized. T is view asserts that the right to free speech is not protected to its fullest extent; instead, judicial limitations of this right were acknowledged by the system.

 Admittedly, neither the American courts nor the literature has devoted signif cant importance to the distinction. 35 T e literature in the United States tends to disregard the distinction between the two-stage model

(distinguishing the scope of the constitutional right from the extent of its realization) and the single-stage model (focusing on the right's scope only). 36 However, the issue has not yet been clarif ed in American literature. Several views exist as to the proper constitutional attitude. T ey all agree that the requirement relating to "a proper purpose" (and the concomitant requirement of compelling government interest) is case law. T is legal approach is an important source of inspiration, in that the constitutional text relating to a constitutional right may be limited or af ected without explicit textual authority to do so. It seems this is an interesting comparative law source which allows the recognition of implied (or judge-made) limitation on a constitutional right. 37

# iii. Constitutions determining that human rights can be limited "by law"

 Human rights provisions in several constitutions are accompanied by provisions of specif c limitation clauses allowing for the limitation of those rights "by law." 38 In most cases, these constitutions provide no additional guidance as to the conditions required for imposing such limitation. 39 T e recognized interpretation is that the constitutional requirement for limitation "by law" also entails a " rule of law" component – in both the formal and substantive meaning of the term. 40 T is requirement is based on the substantive test which provides it with the necessary legitimation. T is "rule of law" notion may be reduced down, in essence, to the requirement of proportionality. As Professor Grimm observed:

> Laws could restrict human rights, but only in order to make conf icting rights compatible or to protect the rights of other persons or important community interests … [A]ny restriction of human rights not only needs

 Accordingly, any limitation clause (either specif c or general) that provides that the right may be limited "by law" is not an open invitation to the legislator to limit the right as it sees f t. T e limitation must be proportional. It should serve a proper purpose. T e means should be rational and necessary. T e harm to the constitutional right must be proportional to the benef t gained from the limitation itself (proportionality stricto sensu ).

 What, then, is the added value of the requirement that a limitation be made "by law?" Is this requirement not redundant? Could we not argue that even in the absence of such a requirement any limitation of a constitutional right must be proportional? T ere are several possible answers. First, one may argue that the requirement of a "by law" limitation is designed to eliminate the purposive result of a "negative solution," 42 according to which a limitation is not legally plausible. Despite the fact that this interpretation is erroneous, it is still possible that the court will provide this interpretation. In order to prevent the latter, an explicit provision was enacted which allows for the limitation of the constitutional right by a proportional sub-constitutional provision. Another possible explanation is that the term "law" indicates the desired level of the limiting norm as being a statute alone, emphasizing that a limitation cannot be imposed by either administrative regulations or case law. T is explanation seems incorrect to me for two reasons: f rst, there is no reason to prevent regulations found within the law from limiting the constitutional right; second, in constitutions in civil law systems, there is no need to determine that a ruling by the court (which does not interpret a constitutional provision) cannot limit a constitutional right. T e latter is obvious. Despite this, in common law constitutions, as well as in international treaties, it is inappropriate to limit the possibility of limiting the constitutional right by common law. T erefore, the expression "law" in the limitation clauses should be interpreted as encompassing the common law. Another view, proposed by Alexy, is that an explicit provision may provide the legislator

with wider discretion (as to limiting the rights) than otherwise provided by a constitutional silence. 43 It is agreed that the legislator has very wide discretion in deciding whether to limit a constitutional right or not, and, if so, for what purpose and by what means. 44 But such a wide discretionary power exists regardless of an explicit constitutional provision allowing the legislator to do so "by law." T e scope of that discretion, importantly, is not changed by such a provision.

### 4. Specif c limitation clauses

T e most prevalent method of limiting constitutional rights in modern constitutions is by adopting several constitutional limitation clauses. 45 T ese are the specif c limitation clauses. T ey provide special arrangements for each constitutional right (or group of rights). T us, they provide both the purpose for which a limitation of a right is valid and the means by which such a purpose may be attained. T is method was adopted by T e European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 46 and by most Western European constitutional democracies established af er the Second World War such as Germany, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. T e same is true for the constitution of India, as well the constitutions of countries part of the former Soviet Union such as Poland and the Czech Republic. 47 In many of the constitutional democracies established af er the Second World War, which include specif c limitation clauses, the courts have ruled that such clauses contain the proportionality requirement. Such was the case with the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. 48 T at was also the case in Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and, as of late, India. 49

## 5. General limitation clauses

T e 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights 50 determines a list of human rights. It does not contain specif c limitation clauses. However, the relative nature of the rights in the Declaration is preserved through the inclusion of a general limitation clause. T is general clause applies to all the rights in the Declaration. Article 29(2) states:

> In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. 51

T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms contains a general limitation clause that provides:

> T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society. 52

T e Canadian general limitation clause, in turn, inf uenced the South African Interim Constitution, 53 and eventually the Final Constitution. 54 Article 36 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa provides:

- (1) T e rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justif able in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom, taking into account all relevant factors, including
- (a) T e nature of the right;
- (b) T e importance of the purpose of the limitation;
- (c) T e nature and extent of the limitation;
- (d) T e relation between the limitation and its purpose; and
- (e) Less restrictive means to achieve the purpose.
- (2) Except as provided in subsection (1) or in any other provision of the Constitution, no law may limit any right entrenched in the Bill of Rights. 55

	- 55 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 36.

 Israel, too, was inf uenced by the Canadian general limitation clause. Accordingly, the limitation clause included in Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty provides:

> T ere shall be no infringement of rights under this Basic Law except by a law bef tting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required. 56

 A similar provision appears in the Israeli Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. 57 In all of these constitutional texts, the rights appear to be of an absolute nature. T eir relative nature is the result of reading them in conjunction with the general limitation clause.

 All the general limitation clauses were interpreted by the courts as containing the proportionality requirement. Such is the case in relation to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 58 T is is also the case regarding the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 59 as well as with regard to the limitation clauses appearing in both the interim and f nal constitutions of South Africa. 60 T e new Federal Constitution of Switzerland of 1999 has a general limitation clause expressly containing the principle of proportionality:

- 1. Restrictions on fundamental rights must have a legal basis. Signif cant restrictions must have their basis in a federal act. T e foregoing does not apply in cases of serious and immediate danger where no other course of action is possible.
- 2. Restrictions on fundamental rights must be justif ed in the public interest or for the protection of the fundamental rights of others.
- 3. Any restrictions on fundamental rights must be proportionate.
- 4. T e essence of fundamental rights is sacrosanct. 61

 Other constitutions, such as the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, contain explicit references to the principle of proportionality. It provides that a limitation "shall not be in conf ict with … the principles of proportionality." 62 T is is also the case with the Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation.

### 6. Hybrid limitation clauses

 Dif erent constitutions have adopted dif erent arrangements to limit the rights they contain. T ere is no agreed-upon arrangement shared by all constitutions. In fact, some of the constitutions include both general and specif c limitation clauses. T is is the case, for example, with the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 63 T ese situations are dubbed "hybrid arrangements." 64

 Hybrid arrangements can raise serious issues in examining the relationship between the general limitation clause and specif c limitation clauses. 65 T ese are interpretive questions. Both the general and specif c limitation clauses make up a part of the constitution. T ey are of equal normative status. Accordingly, while applying constitutional purposive interpretation to these provisions we should make every ef ort to read them together harmoniously. We should not assume that one prevails over the other. It is important to note – as a basic premise – that the general limitation clause applies to all constitutional rights, including those accompanied by a specif c limitation clause. In some cases, the specif c limitation clause is used to set stricter or laxer conditions than those set out by the general limitation clause with regard to the limitation of a single right. In other cases, the specif c clause is designed to clarify, or emphasize, the limitation condition of a certain right. When the proper interpretation of a specif c limitation clause is that of providing stricter, or laxer, conditions for limitations, such interpretation should be given legal ef ect. 66 T is result is consistent with standard canons of interpretation, according to which, when two rule-shaped constitutional norms of the same normative level conf ict, the norm later in time will prevail over the former, unless the former consists of a specif c law ( lex specialis ); when both norms are found in the same document, the specif c norm should be given the interpretive preference as long as no other interpretation can be found. Accordingly, since the specif c limitation clause is "specif c law"

in relation to the general limitation clause, in a case of conf ict between them 67 the specif c provision should prevail.

# 7. T e preferred regime: general, specif c, or hybrid limitation clause?

 An interesting question is what arrangement is the best to limit constitutional rights? In terms of legal certainty, that best regime seems to be a general limitation clause. A general, comprehensive clause would enable the legal system to develop a general, comprehensive theory of rights limitation. True, a heavy burden would be placed on the judicial branch, which will have to play a signif cant role in developing a uniform approach to this complicated issue while reconciling the dif erent constitutional cases. Another view considers the best approach in terms of the rights' protection. Here, the preferred approach is that of several specif c limitation clauses. 68 By providing a unique arrangement for each right (or group of rights), the constituent authority may accurately ref ect its views as to the relative importance of each right. Accordingly, the constitutional authority may "derive" a unique arrangement for limitation that takes into account each of the many complicated constitutional features of the specif c right. T us, for example, while general limitation clauses rarely include a detailed list of the proper purposes for which a limitation is justif ed, specif c limitation clauses do contain such an account in many cases. T e judicial task thus becomes easier, as purposes not included within the constitutional provision are eliminated. Accordingly, in most cases, the right itself is better protected.

T e preferred constitutional regime is that of specif c limitation clauses. Such an arrangement requires the constituent authority to consider each right separately. It further requires that same authority to examine each and every reason to limit the right separately and then to repeat the process regarding each of the rights included in the constitution. As such, the protection of each right would be more accurately and structurally def ned and thus the extent of their protection – the ways in which they can be realized – would be easier to establish. Along with the specif c clauses one may consider the inclusion of a general limitation clause expressing the

 concept of proportionality as an "umbrella concept" applying to all constitutional rights.

# **B. Te formalrole of proportionality**

### 1. Proportionality regarding validity and proportionality regarding meaning

 Proportionality is a central term in modern constitutional law. It serves dif erent and various functions. Its meaning may change with the dif erent roles it purports to f ll. T us, for example, the term proportionality as used in criminal law is not the same as the one used by administrative law and both terms dif er from the term as used by international law. Moreover, even within one legal f eld – such as constitutional law – the understanding of the term proportionality has changed over the years.

T is book focuses on analyzing proportionality as a criterion for resolving constitutional questions relating to conf icting norms that exist at dif erent levels of the constitutional hierarchy. Within this general framework, this book examines a specif c case of a superior norm (found within the constitution), which establishes a human right, and an inferior norm (found within a statutory provision, or the common law), which attempts to limit that right. Central to the analysis, therefore, is the question of the validity of the sub-constitutional norm in conf ict with a constitutional norm establishing a human right. T is book examines the relationship between a human right based in the constitution and a contradictory law located at a lower normative level, such as a statute or the common law. It does not discuss the application of proportionality in "institutional" constitutional arrangements, such as the three branches' structure and their mutual relationships. A dif erent situation will be discussed where both the right and the limiting law are of equal normative status – both are prescribed by statute. Specif cally, a situation where the court is authorized to declare the compatibility or incompatibility of the statutory norm limiting a statutory right with the requirements set by the limitation clause (based on proportionality), which can also be found in a statute, will be examined. T is "non-constitutional" proportionality setting exists in England 69 and in Victoria, Australia. 70 Despite the fact that both norms exist at the same level of the constitutional hierarchy,

<sup>69</sup> See section 4(2) of the Human Rights Act 1998.

<sup>70</sup> See section 7 of the Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006.

the fact that the courts are authorized to determine the incompatibility of the limiting statute on the statutory right renders the analysis quite similar to that of a typical constitutional setting, where one norm is superior to the other. 71

 Proportionality has another signif cant role – its interpretive function. At the core of this interpretive function is the issue of providing meaning to legal norms, and in particular that of statutory interpretation. Within this role, proportionality is used as a criterion for providing meaning to the legislative norm. To achieve this, proportionality in its narrow sense ( stricto sensu ), or the notion of balancing, is used by analogy. T is role is dubbed "interpretive balancing." 72

## 2. T e constitutionality of limiting a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law

## i. A limitation of a constitutional right

 Constitutional limitation clauses do not apply in every situation where two norms are in conf ict with each other. Rather, they apply in those situations where one of the conf icting norms contains a constitutional right. T e limitation clause and the notion of proportionality on which it is based were designed to provide both the justif cation for limiting a constitutional human right and the boundaries of such a justif cation. T ey do so in light of the basic democratic, and rule of law, tenets according to which it is sometimes justif ed to limit one person's constitutional right to realize other public interests or to guarantee the rights of other persons. T is justif cation does not apply – and therefore neither does the limitation clause – when the conf icting norms are not related to human rights. T us, for example, where the higher norm sets up the structure of an executive body, or prescribes the manner in which an administrative agency operates – if these issues are unrelated to human rights – then the limitation clause is not triggered.

### ii. T e limiting norm is sub-constitutional

T e limitation clause in various constitutions – whether explicit or implicit 73 – are primarily designed to provide the conditions under which a

<sup>71</sup> T e argument that, in UK law, the Human Rights Act 1998 creates a higher norm than other regular statute will not be discussed: see Kavanagh, above note 27, at 269. 72 See above, at 72.

<sup>73</sup> For a distinction between an expressed and implied limitation clause, see above, at 134.

limitation of a constitutional right by a sub constitutional norm (e.g., statute, common law) would be justif ed and therefore valid. T us, for example, in Israel the limitation clause provides:

> T ere shall be no infringement of rights under this Basic Law except by a law bef tting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required. 74

 Similar provisions, emphasizing the constitutional nature of the right on the one hand, and the sub-constitutional nature of the limiting norm on the other, are found in other constitutions' limitation clauses. 75 Such provisions def ne the conditions under which a justif cation exists for limiting a constitutional right by a lower, sub-constitutional law. T e limitation clause thus provides a constitutional foundation for the authority of both the legislator and the common law 76 to limit constitutional rights.

T e constitutional limitation clause is based on the hierarchical relationship between the limited constitutional right and the limiting law. T e limited right exists at the constitutional level. T e limiting law – a statute or the common law – exists at the sub-constitutional level. T e purpose for which the limitation was prescribed is either the public interest or the protection of a right. With this hierarchical background several questions arise. First, what is the reason for such a hierarchical relationship between the norms? Second, what is the law when the hierarchical order is not relevant and a constitutional right is limited by another constitutional norm? T ird, what is the case when the hierarchical order is relevant and the right limited is at the sub-constitutional level and the limiting norm is found at a lower sub-constitutional level? Fourth, what is the law when the hierarchical order is not relevant – both norms are of equal normative status – and the norms exist only at the sub-constitutional level? Finally, what is the law when the hierarchical relationship is reversed – that is, the limited right exists at a sub-constitutional level and the limiting norm exists as either a constitutional norm or a higher sub-constitutional norm? Each of these issues will now be discussed brief y.

Constitution, Art. 36. 76 See above, at 121.

### 3. T e reason behind the constitutional hierarchical relationship

### i. T e constitutionality of a limitation

T e basic assumption underlying every hierarchical legal order is that the constitution is the highest-level norm in the system. From this fundamental understanding stems the conclusion that, if conf ict arises, the higherranking norm prevails over the lower-ranking norm in the hierarchical order: lex superior derogt legi inferiori . A lower norm cannot overcome a higher norm. Accordingly, a statute or the common law cannot limit a constitutionally protected human right. 77 As such, the proper status of human rights in the legal system is maintained. Sub-constitutional norms cannot legally limit those rights. One possible conclusion of this description is that every law attempting to limit a constitutional right is unconstitutional. Another possible conclusion is that the courts in a constitutional democracy (either every court in the system or a special court specif cally designed for this role) 78 may pronounce the invalidity (or unconstitutionality) of a law limiting constitutional rights. T is is of en the case, but not always. 79 T e same constitution which provides that no law can limit the rights it contains can also provide that under certain circumstances a limiting law can be constitutional, and therefore valid. T e norm that has given may also take away, and vice versa .

T is is the ef ect of the constitutional limitation clause. It is designed, formally speaking, to overcome the interpretive canon according to which a superior norm always prevails over an inferior norm. 80 Indeed, the formal role of the limitation clause (and the proportionality principle found at its center) is to enable the limitation of a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law, without this limitation being considered

<sup>77</sup> T is is the modern premise for judicial review as pronounced by Chief Justice Marshall

in Marbury v. Madison , 5 US (1 Cranch) 137 (1803). 78 See V. Ferreres Comella, Constitutional Courts and Democratic Values: A European

Perspective (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2009 ). 79 See Art. 120 of the Constitution of T e Netherlands: "T e constitutionality of Acts of Parliament and Treaties shall not be reviewed by the courts." See Constitutions of Europe: Texts Collected by the Council of Europe Venice Commission (Leiden: Martinus Nijhof Publishers, 2004), 1291. 80 See HCJ 1384/98 Avni v. Prime Minister of Israel [1998] IsrSC 52(5) 206 ("In the rela-

tionship between regular legislation and Basic Law, the canon according to which the superior norm prevails over the inferior norm ( lex superior derogat inferiori ) applies. Of course, there is no restriction on providing, within the Basic Law itself, the conditions under which a legislative provision would be able to limit Basic Law provisions. T e limitation clauses found in our Basic Laws do just that." (Barak, P.)).

unconstitutional and therefore invalid. Of course, this result can be achieved through interpretation, by recognizing an implicit or judgemade limitation. In order to avoid doubt regarding the latter, the explicit limitation clause comes into ef ect.

### ii. A limitation by a sub-constitutional law

T e proportionality in the limitation clause examines the constitutionality of a limitation on a constitutional right caused by a sub-constitutional law. Constitutional limitation clauses, by their nature, deal with limitations on constitutional rights by a sub-constitutional law; this is true whether the limitation clause is explicit or implicit, whether the constitutional right is shaped as a principle or as a rule; whether the subconstitutional law is shaped as a principle or a rule. In many cases, the sub-constitutional laws that can limit the right are combined under the term "law." 81 T is term includes both statutes and the common law. 82 In civil law systems, the constitution may specify that the limiting norm has to be a statute. 83

T e limitation clause is a part of the constitution itself. Its normative status, therefore, is equal to that of the limited rights. For the right's limitation to be valid, the normative foundation of such a limitation must be found (expressly or impliedly) in the constitution itself. 84 A constitution that includes provisions establishing constitutional rights may also include provisions establishing the legal possibility of limiting such rights by a sub-constitutional law. T e constitutional limitation clause f lls that role. T e clause enables a limitation on a constitutional right by a subconstitutional law in a manner that would render the limitation constitutional. T at is the essence of the proportional limitations, which provide a valid legal justif cation for the limitation of a constitutional right. T us, ref ecting the limited nature of the limitation clause: it does not alter the normative status of the limiting law; it does not turn the limiting law into a part of the constitution. T e limiting law remains at its sub-constitutional level. T e limitation clause, in turn, provides a protective "legal umbrella" to the limiting law. T us, when the limitation is proportional,

<sup>81</sup> See, e.g., Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1, above note 75; Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 36; European Convention on Human Rights, Arts. 8–10, above note 15; Constitution of India, Art. 13(2). 82 See above, at 121.

<sup>83</sup> See Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Arts. 2(2), 8(2), 11(2), 14(1)

<sup>(&</sup>quot; Gesetz "). 84 See Alexy, above note 26.

the regular rules demanding the preference of a higher-ranking norm over a lower-ranking one would not apply; whenever the limitation is not proportional, however, the protective "umbrella" disappears and the usual rules – providing a preference to the higher-ranking norm – will apply. In such cases, the limiting law is unconstitutional. T e proportionality of the limitation on a constitutional right provides the justif cation for such a limitation. When the justif cation disappears, the rationale for constitutional protection of the limitation goes along with it.

T is formal function of the limitation clause – and the proportionality requirement at its center – leads to the conclusion that, when there is no limitation of a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law, the limitation clause (and the proportionality requirement) would not apply. T e limitation clause and the proportionality requirement at its center were designed to narrow the application of the rule according to which the higher-ranking norm is always superior to the lower-ranking norm. Without a conf ict between two norms of a dif erent constitutional status, and without the involvement of a human right, there is no room for the application of the limitation clause.

 What is the case when a constitutional provision outside the limitation clause authorizes a state actor to limit a constitutional right? T e Hugo case in South Africa illustrates this situation. 85 T e Constitution of the Republic of South Africa grants the President of the Republic the authority to "pardon … or reprieve … of enders." 86T e President, exercising this power, decided to pardon women prisoners who were mothers to children under the age of twelve. T e pardon did not apply to male prisoners in a similar situation. T e argument before the court was whether this exercise of power was discriminatory. Assuming, for a moment, that the presidential decision is, indeed, discriminatory, 87 would the constitutional general limitation clause apply to such a decision? T e answer is yes. T e act of pardoning is authorized by the constitution, but does not – in and of itself – make up a part of the constitution. It therefore represents a subconstitutional action by the state. T e authority to pardon according to the constitution does not come with any guidelines for its application. T e question, then, is whether the exercise of such authority is governed by the general limitation clause. T is question can be described as an intra-constitutional interpretive question. Does the limitation clause apply in these

<sup>85</sup> President of the Republic of South Africa and Another v. Hugo , 1997 (4) SA 1 (CC). 86 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 84(2)(j).

<sup>87</sup> T at assumption was not shared by most judges in the case.

types of situation? If the answer to that question is yes, then the next question is whether the specif c constitutional provision relating to the power to pardon prevents the application of the general limitation clause. T e only judge in Hugo willing to entertain that question was of the opinion that the limitation clause should apply in these cases, and that no other provision in the constitution prevents such a result. 88

 Does the analysis thus far suggest that the limitation clause is not applicable – or has no legal signif cance – whenever the legal system does not recognize the concept of judicial review of legislation? Strictly speaking, it is clear that a limitation clause may appear in the constitution without concomitant recognition by the legal system of judicial review. But, while the constitutional restriction – on disproportional limitation – may still apply, there would be no practical way to enforce it; the limiting statute would not be declared unconstitutional by the courts. T at, however, does not render the limitation clause entirely superf uous. It still serves as a guiding light to all state actors, who are sworn to uphold the constitution and its provisions. It can also be used as a basis for a judicial declaration of incompatibility between the limiting statute and the constitution, even when such incompatibility may not lead to a declaration of invalidity. 89 Even without such a declaration, the limiting clause's value as a guide is preserved. T rough judicial review we can achieve institutional restraint. In addition, the use of interpretive balancing would still apply in the absence of judicial review. 90 Finally, the common law would continue to develop in accordance with the constitutional provisions, including its limitation clause.

### 4. T e ef ect on a constitutional right of a constitutional norm

### i. T e norm that giveth may taketh away

 Limitation clauses presuppose constitutional hierarchical orders. According to this order, a right at the constitutional level is limited by a sub-constitutional level law. What is the case, however, when a constitutional right is af ected by another constitutional norm? T e answer is that

<sup>88</sup> See ibid . (Mokgoro, J., concurring). T e other judges were of the opinion that the right to

equality was never limited in the f rst place, and therefore did not consider the question. 89 T is is the case today in England; see the Human Rights Act 1998, section 4(2). It is possible to claim that the authorized court can give a declaration regarding the incompatibility even when an explicit provision on this matter does not exist. See D. Jenkins, "Common Law Declaration of Unconstitutionality," 7 Int. J. Con. L . 183 ( 2009 ). 90 On interpretive balance, see above, at 72.

in these situations the limitation clause does not apply. T ere is no legal need for its use. As we have seen, the clause was designed to regulate a situation where a sub-constitutional norm can limit constitutional rights. T is is the case when a statute or the common law af ects a constitutional right. T e limitation clause (express or implied) sets up the conditions under which a limitation may be constitutional; this is important, since without such a determination each and every limitation by a sub-constitutional norm would be deemed unconstitutional and therefore invalid. T is problem is solved – and the limitation clause is not applicable – when the constitution itself (whether the original constitution or an amendment) af ects a constitutional right. T e same norm that has given may also take away. 91

 It is of course possible to critique the provision in the constitution which af ects constitutional rights. T e place for such criticism is not within the constitutional limitation clause. T is is not its purpose. Its formal role is to allow the sub-constitutional norm to constitutionally limit the constitutional right. Its role is not to set the rules af ecting the constitutional right in the constitution itself. A number of typical situations regarding this matter will be discussed herein.

### ii. Limitation clauses and internal modif ers

 An important distinction is that between constitutional provisions establishing the scope of a constitutional right (either narrowly or widely) and constitutional provisions limiting the possibility of realizing the right within that scope. 92 T e former kind of constitutional provisions are called "internal modif ers" or "internal qualif ers." T e latter kind of constitutional provisions are called "limitations." 93 Limitations do not narrow the scope of the right. Rather, they allow for the limitation of the right within the framework of its scope. 94 Proportionality and constitutional limitation clauses are these kinds of constitutional provisions. T e reason for including those provisions in the constitution is that the limitations themselves are posed by sub-constitutional norms. Without a constitutional (express or implied) foundation, no sub-constitutional norm would be able to limit a constitutional right. By providing such a foundation – or legal "umbrella" – to proportional limitations, the limitation

<sup>91</sup> Some constitutions do not allow any limitation of the right's "core": see below, at 496. T ose provisions do not apply if the core was af ected by a constitutional amendment. See Sachs, above note 31. 92 For the distinction, see above, at 19.

<sup>93</sup> See above, at 19. 94 See above, at 19.

clause overcomes the hierarchical problem of limiting a superior norm by an inferior one.

T e limitation clause and proportionality are irrelevant to an examination of the "internal qualif ers." 95 T ese qualif ers are a part of the constitution itself. T ey do not present any issue relating to constitutional hierarchy. T e only issue they do raise is interpretive in nature: What is the scope of the narrowing (or widening) provision? Limitation clauses, therefore, play no role in the interpretation of the internal qualif ers. However, the interpretive issues posed by the internal qualif ers may include – as part of the process of purposive constitutional interpretation – a need to balance two (or more) competing constitutional principles. T is is an interpretive balance. 96 T is balance, in turn, may be determined by considerations of proportional balancing. T is is not the proportionality found at the center of the constitutional limitation clause. T is is interpretive proportionality. It is based, by analogy, on proportionality stricto sensu . 97

### iii. T e limitation clause and the conf ict of constitutional rights

T e ways in which a conf ict between constitutional rights should be resolved has been examined herein. 98 T e conclusion was that, as far as the constitutional level is concerned, the constitutional limitation clause is not relevant. T e reason for that is as follows. In an intra-constitutional conf ict between two provisions, the issue of constitutional hierarchy is not triggered; therefore, the need to examine the requirements posed by the limitation clause for such a conf ict is not triggered either. T us, for example, there is no reason to examine whether the two conf icting rights serve a "proper purpose." T ere is also no point in reviewing whether the ef ect of one constitutional right by another was authorized "by law." All of those questions are irrelevant when the conf ict is between two constitutional norms. Accordingly, there is no need to turn to the limitation clause. T is use of the clause is reserved for those instances in which a sub-constitutional norm limits a constitutional right. It is not applicable when one constitutional norm conf icts with another constitutional norm. Accordingly, there is no place to examine – in relation to the constitutionality of the conf ict – whether this conf ict is proportional. T e terms set

by the limitation clause may inf uence through analogy the interpretive balancing conducted in such cases, in order to assure unity and harmony within a given legal system. It should be emphasized that such an analogy is of an interpretive nature. It would mostly require the balancing component of proportionality stricto sensu .

# iv. Amendment of a constitutional right by another constitutional norm

T e limitation clause – and the requirement of proportionality at its core – is relevant to an examination of a limitation of a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional norm. T ey are not relevant to an examination of an amendment of a constitutional right by another constitutional norm. T e reason for this distinction is that, when the limitation of a constitutional right is performed by a sub-constitutional norm (statute or the common law), such a limitation requires constitutional authorization. Accordingly, a limitation that is not proportional is not protected by the limitation clause. T is is not the case when the amendment is made by another constitutional norm. Such amendments need not be examined by the limitation clause. Both the amendment and the amending norms are of the same constitutional status. T e same norm that has given may also take away. T e constitutional limitation clause has no place in this discussion. Accordingly, a constitutional amendment performed in accordance with all the formal requirements demanded by the constitution is not obliged to abide by the requirements of the limitation clause. Such an amendment would be constitutional even if it is disproportional. 99 However, every interpretive ef ort should be made to eliminate such a conf ict. Here the judge may well use interpretive balancing by analogy. 100

# 5. Limitation of a sub-constitutional norm by a lower sub-constitutional norm

 What happens when the hierarchical order "descends" one level and both the limited and limiting norms operate at the sub-constitutional level? Take a right protected by statute and a limiting norm consisting of an administrative regulation or the common law; or take a right protected by an administrative regulation that is limited by the common law – what

<sup>99</sup> Such constitutional amendment may still be disqualif ed due to other considerations, such as the doctrine acknowledging "unconstitutional amendments." See above, at 31. 100 On interpretive balancing, see above, at 72.

should then be the case? T e answer to these – and similar – questions is not found within the conf nes of the constitutional limitation clause. T is clause applies to cases where a constitutional right is limited. When the limitation does not relate to a constitutional right, the constitutional limitation clause does not apply.

 Where, then, should we look for the solution in such situations? What might that solution be? Regarding the f rst case – where a right protected by a statute is limited by an administrative regulation – here one can think of two types of case. In the f rst, the limiting regulation was enacted in accordance with an authorization granted by the same statute that establishes the right itself. In the second, the limiting regulation and the limited right originate in two separate statutes. We begin with the f rst type. When the two norms originate from the same statute, we should examine the congruence between the statutory authorization and the regulation itself: Was the regulation promulgated in accordance with the powers granted by the statute? Such an examination is interpretive in nature. It entails a thorough examination of the context of the authorizing legislation, including the human rights context. T at concludes the examination. In the second type of case – where the limiting regulation and the limited right originate from two separate statutes – we should conduct two separate examinations. We f rst examine whether the regulation was promulgated in accordance with the powers granted by the statute. If so, we move to our second examination. Here we look at the relationship between the two statutes – the one establishing the right and the other granting the authority to limit it. We are faced with two statutes of equal constitutional status. T ey conf ict with each other. We may apply the standard canons of interpretation to such a conf ict. However, we should make every interpretive ef ort to eliminate the conf ict and provide an interpretive solution establishing unity and harmony within the legal system. 101

 In the second case, a right established by statute or a (properly promulgated) administrative regulation is limited by the common law. In such a case, the statute or the regulation should prevail, as the common law may not override a legislative provision or a properly promulgated administrative regulation. T e true nature of the conf ict should be examined carefully in this type of case. Such an examination is interpretive in nature.

 To conclude, in both cases – where the limitation is either by administrative regulation or by common law – the issue is solved through

101 See above, at 70.

interpretive means. T ese interpretive means would include an interpretive balancing between the conf icting norms. 102 In both cases, the limitation clause does not apply. It applies only in cases where the limited norm exists at the constitutional level and the limiting norm exists at the sub-constitutional level, while in the cases examined here, both norms operate at the sub-constitutional level. However, we may apply, by analogy, the balancing conducted with the proportionality stricto sensu . 103

### 6. Limitation of a sub-constitutional norm by an equal-level norm

T e constitutional limitation clause applies when a constitutional right is limited by a sub-constitutional norm. Does it apply when a statutory right is limited by the provisions of another statute?

T e answer to these – and similar – questions is that, whenever statutes conf ict, the standard interpretive canons apply. T us, for example, when these norms are shaped as rules, the later norm will prevail ( lex posteriori derogat legi priori ), unless the earlier norm constitutes a special law ( lex specialis derogat legi generali ). 104 T e same is true in cases where one of the equal-level norms is shaped as a rule while the other is shaped as a principle. 105 However, when both norms are shaped as principles, we should f rst examine whether the solution can be found at the legislative level, or, where the conf ict cannot be resolved at that level, the solution can only be found at the sub-legislative level. 106 As for two statutory rights that are in conf ict, the earlier discussion – relating to two conf icting constitutional rights – may apply here as well, mutatis mutandis . 107 When two common law precedents are in conf ict, the rules of stare decisis will apply. An examination of these rules is beyond the scope of this book. In none of these cases is the limitation clause triggered. Rather, the solution is interpretive in nature. Within the interpretive process, the interpreter may need to use interpretive balancing; in these cases, this can be done by analogy to the balancing used by the component of proportionality stricto sensu . 108

 A special case is that of a statute establishing a human right and providing instructions as to the proper limitation of such a right by another statute. T is is the case with the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act of 1990. 109

<sup>102</sup> See above, at 72. 103 See above, at 72. 104 See above, at 87. 105 See above, at 97. 106 See above, at 89. 107 See above, at 87. 108 See above, at 72. 109 No. 109. A similar case is that of the State of Victoria in Australia; see Charter of Human Rights and Responsibilities Act 2006 (Vic.).

#### 158 Proportionality: sources, nature, function

T is Bill of Rights is entrenched in a statute. It is not governed by a constitutional (or other supra-legislative) provision. 110 T e New Zealand statutory provisions were essentially copied from the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. New Zealand adopted the Canadian limitation clause, but changed it to ref ect the dif erent constitutional levels in which the two clauses operate. T us, the New Zealand limitation clause provides:

> Subject to Section 4 of this Bill of Rights, the rights and freedoms contained in the Bill of Rights may be subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society. 111

Section 4 of the Bill of Rights Act states, in turn:

 No court shall, in relation to any enactment (whether passed or made before or af er the commencement of this Bill of Rights)—

- (a) hold any provision of the enactment to be impliedly repealed or revoked, or to be in any way invalid or inef ective; or
- (b) decline to apply any provision of the enactment

 by reason only that the provision is inconsistent with any provision of this Bill of Rights. 112

 Accordingly, in New Zealand (according to sections 4 and 5 of the Bill of Rights Act), whenever a statute limits a statutory human right, even if the limitation is disproportional, the limiting statute remains valid; it may not be repealed or revoked. T is is true both for limiting statutes enacted before the Bill of Rights Act went into force as well as for later limiting statutes.

 What is the role of New Zealand's limitation clause? It seems that it has a triple role. First, it can play a role whenever the conf ict is between a statutory provision and a common law precedent. New Zealand's common law (to the extent it does not include its statutory-interpretation function) must abide by the requirements posed by the limitation clause. 113 Second, the limitation clause has interpretive value. T e use of interpretive balancing is not eliminated by the provisions of section 4 of

- 
<sup>110</sup> See P. Rishworth, G. Huscrof , S. Optican, and R. Mahoney, New Zealand Bill of Rights (Oxford University Press, 2003); P. A. Joseph, Constitutional and Administrative Law in

New Zealand , 3rd edn. (Wellington: Brookers, 2007 ). 111 New Zealand Bill of Rights, Art. 5 ("Justif ed Limitations"). See above note 109. 112 Ibid ., Art. 4 ("Other Enactments Not Af ected"). 113 See above, at 121.

the Bill of Rights Act. 114 Such interpretive balancing may assist in the continuing development of New Zealand's legislation – by means of statutory interpretation rules – in the spirit of the Bill of Rights. Indeed, a specif c provision in the Bill of Rights Act requires that "[w]herever an enactment can be given a meaning that is consistent with the rights and freedoms contained in this Bill of Rights, that meaning shall be preferred to any other meaning." 115 T is provision may encourage the development of new interpretive rules that will protect human rights more vigorously. T ird, the statutory limitation clause may serve an important guiding function. It may guide the New Zealand legislator on how to act in a manner that would not disproportionally limit human rights included within the Bill of Rights. Accordingly, the clause may also serve a deterrent purpose, as it may deter Members of Parliament from supporting a disproportional legislation. While the limiting legislation may not stand trial in court – i.e., it would not be the subject of judicial review – it will certainly stand trial in the court of public opinion, hence the importance of the limitation

 clause. Another case is that of the United Kingdom's Human Rights Act (HRA) of 1998. 116 T e act gives ef ect in the United Kingdom to the legal rights established by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, including those with specif c limitation clauses. In terms of interpretation, the HRA provides that "[s]o far as it is possible to do so, primary legislation and subordinate legislation must be read and given ef ect in a way which is compatible with the Convention's rights." 117 However, if such interpretation is not possible, the "validity, continuing operation, or enforcement" of the incompatible legislation would not be af ected. 118 In these kinds of situation, if the court is "satisf ed that the provision is incompatible with a Convention right," it may "make a declaration of that incompatibility." 119 T at declaration may trigger an expedited legislative process which would "make such amendments to the legislation … necessary to remove the incompatibility." 120

 What is the ef ect of the HRA? It seems that there is agreement on two conclusions. First, that the HRA has not authorized the courts in the UK to declare that a statute incompatible with the rights incorporated by the HRA is void. T e law's validity is preserved. Second, in practice, the chances that the incompatible statute will persist is unlikely. In most cases when there has been a declaration of incompatibility, the statute has been amended by the legislator so as to make it compatible. T e concern that, if that law was not changed, the European Court of Human Rights – to whom a claim by the losing side may be presented – will reach the same result may have led to the change in the UK's law. T e constitutional status of the HRA is controversial. 121 T is controversy concerns two developments which characterize the HRA. One, the development of special rules for the interpretation of statutes which are claimed as incompatible with the HRA. 122 T ese rules dif er from the regular rules of statutory interpretation. T ey severely limit the cases when the court will have to declare a statute incompatible. Second, according to the regular rules for the conf ict of statutes, in those cases when the statute which came af er the HRA is incompatible with it, the court could determine that the provision within the HRA is impliedly repealed. T is is not the case regarding the HRA. When the court determines the later statute to be incompatible 123 with the HRA, it cannot repeal the HRA's provision. All it can do is declare the incompatibility of the statute. T ese developments lead some to the conclusion that the HRA is at a higher normative level than an ordinary statute.

T e controversy existing in UK law regarding the legal status of the HRA is not connected to the question of proportionality – and its four components – which also apply regarding the rights incorporated by the HRA and which are limited by statutes. T e UK courts are required

<sup>(</sup>Wilkinson) v. Inland Revenue Commissioners [2006] All ER 529. 123 T is is also the case for a statute enacted before the HRA. Regarding this statute, it may be said that the HRA is weaker than a regular statute, because, according to the implied repeal rule, the older statute would be voided, yet the HRA prevents the declaration of voidability and replaces it with a declaration of incompatibility.

by the HRA to determine if a statute which limited the rights is incompatible with those rights. To do so, it must f rst establish the scope of the right set forth in the HRA (the f rst stage of the legal analysis), and, second, respond to the question whether the limitation is proportional (the second stage of the legal analysis). Within the framework of the second stage – the determination whether the limitation is proportional – the rules of proportionality and all its components will apply. It is similar to the constitutional balancing, other than the remedy (the third stage) which is not voiding but rather a declaration of incompatibility. T e dif erence therefore is not with regard to the application of the rules of proportionality, but rather with regard to the remedy for the disproportional limitation of the right. T erefore, there is room to apply the rules of proportionality which apply to the relationship between constitutional rights and sub-constitutional law which limits the right, and also to the relationship between the rights incorporated by the HRA and the statute which limits them (whether it was enacted before or af er the HRA).

# **C. Te substantive role of proportionality**

# 1. Human rights and their limitation

- i. Democracy: rights and obligations
 Human rights constitute an essential part of modern democracies. We should never forget that these democracies were built atop the ruins of the Second World War and the Holocaust. Take human rights out of democracy, and democracy has lost its soul. Human rights are the crown jewels of democracy. A democracy without human rights is like an empty vessel.

 Human rights are essential to democracy. However, democracy cannot exist when based only on human rights. A democratic society must acknowledge the possibility of limiting those rights. 124T ere are two types of limitation. 125 T e f rst type includes a limitation on one person's right in order to make way for the rights of another person. If one member of society may act as he pleases without any limitation, the rights of another member to do the same would be concomitantly limited. A principled recognition of both persons' freedom to act also requires the placing of

<sup>124</sup> See A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 82. 125 See below, at 253.

limitations on both persons' ability to exercise this freedom. T is idea can be found as far back as the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, which states:

> Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. T ese limits can only be determined by law. 126

T e second type of limitation on human rights in a democracy consists of limitations in favor of public interest considerations. In a democratic society, a human right may be limited to ensure the very existence of the state; to ensure its continued existence as a democracy; to ensure public health; to ensure public education; as well as several other national causes. T ese are the purposes for which a democratic society may limit the rights of its members. 127 In fact, the state may even impose duties, including the duty to sacrif ce one's life for society. 128 T is demonstrates the special nature of democracy, which is based on the idea that the state protects the rights of the individual, and the individual protects the state – its safety and peaceful existence. 129

126 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen 1789, Art. 4. 127 See below, at 256. 128 See Osiatynski, above note 47. 129 See HCJ 164/97 Contrem Ltd . v. Minister of Finance [1998] IsrSC 52(1) 289, 320 ("T e state authority and the citizen do not stand against each other, on two sides of the wall; rather, they stand alongside each other, partners in the enterprise of the state … T e government (or, as I prefer to call it, the public service) must serve the public – to guarantee peace and legal order; to provide essential services; to protect the human dignity and liberty of each citizen; to create social justice. But at the same time, the same public service – which, in and of itself, is unable to provide all those services – must be received from the public in order to provide. T e proper relationship between the public service and the public – in fact, the only possible relationship – is a relationship based on a mutual give and take. Accordingly, the same type of relationship should exist between the state agency and the citizen. A citizen may not assume, morally or practically, that he may demand – and receive – everything from the agency, while he owes nothing to the same. While he may have some rights vis-à-vis the state agency, he also has duties. T is is the essence of the social contract between the members of the democratic society and themselves, and between them and their public service. T is is the essence of the existence of the modern democratic state." (Zamir, J.); "Democracy does not only constitute human rights. Democracy is also made up of human duties. T ese entail duties towards other people, and duties towards the government. Indeed, democracy is based on a shared notion of national interests. T e government is set up to serve the people. In order to do so, the government must be equipped with powers. Without those powers, the government would be unable to realize the public interest. T ose governmental powers, in turn, create duties for individuals. T ese duties are imposed in order for the government to fulf ll the national goals it aims to achieve in

### ii. T e relationship between human rights and the public interest

 Human rights are essential to democracy; at the same time their very existence presupposes a democratic regime. T us, the existence of a democratic society and human rights is interrelated. To have a democracy, you must guarantee human rights; and to guarantee human rights, you must have a democracy. 130 "A constitution is not a recipe for suicide, and human rights are not a prescription for national annihilation … Each nation's legislative provisions should be interpreted in a way that assumes each nation's continued existence. Human rights derive from that same existence, and therefore they should not become a weapon for the destruction of the democratic state." 131 To the same extent, "human rights should not be sacrif ced on the altar of the state. Human rights are natural to humans, and they existed long before the birth of the modern democracy. Indeed, the protection of human rights also requires the adoption of a social and national framework that guarantees – and recognizes the importance of – such protection." 132 A democracy is based on mutual respect between the rights of the individuals and the public interest. Both human rights and the public interest constitute a part of the constitutional structure which both establishes the rights and enables their limitation. 133

a democratic regime. T ey derive from that same shared notion of national interests, as well as the need to promote the liberty of every individual. T ey are based on the modern concept of the welfare state, and on social solidarity. T ey derive from the notion that considers the individual as someone who is shaped by his surroundings, and therefore includes, as part of his personality, a 'social facet.' From this 'social facet' comes the need to take the entire society into account. T is same society may demand the individual – as a member of the society – to act to advance the public interest. Such a demand is the result of balancing between public needs and the individual rights."

# iii. T e limitation clause as an instrument in shaping the proper relationship between human rights and their limitations

 What is the proper relationship between the rights of the individuals and the public interest? When is it justif ed for the state to impose a limitation on a person's right towards his fellow citizens and towards the state? T ere is no agreed-upon answer to these questions. T e answer changes from one legal system to another and from one period to another. It seems that the only agreed-upon principle is that the proper relationship between human rights and the public interest is the relationship that is deemed proper by a democratic society.

 How, then, would a democracy determine that proper relationship? What is the instrument used for this determination when the human right is a constitutional right? T e answer is found in the limitation clause – and in the proportionality which shapes it. Proportionality is the legal instrument by which the proper relationship between constitutional rights and their sub-constitutional law limitations is determined. It is a legal "institution." It is a legal construction. It provides the relevant considerations regarding the proper relationship between the constitutional right and its sub-constitutional limitation. 134 Proportionality and the limitation clause limit both the powers of the state and the rights of the individual. 135

### iv. T e centrality of proportionality and the limitation clause

T e proportionality requirements set by the limitation clause are at the heart of the doctrine of human rights. T ose requirements express the complexity of the modern constitutional right. Such a right was designed to let each member of society realize their wishes to the fullest extent; alas, such a realization is not possible without the limitation by law of other people's rights. In addition, we should acknowledge the possibility that no full realization

and his duty towards the society as a whole." (Barak, P.)). See also Contram , above note 129, at para. 346 ("T e nature of life within a democratic society requires at times a limitation of human rights. Indeed, the protection of human rights is not possible without the limitation of human rights. A democratic regime does not entail unlimited human rights. Human rights are not a prescription for national annihilation. A central feature of a democratic regime is that it would only permit a limitation of human rights in order to promote human rights, and even then, only to the smallest extent possible. A democracy allows for limitations on human rights in order to enable the continued existence of

a social framework guaranteeing human rights.". (Barak, P.)). 134 See S. Woolman, "Riding the Push-Me Pull-You: Constructing a Test T at Reconciles the Conf icting Interests Which Animate the Limitation Clause," 10 SAJHR 60, 77 ( 1994 ). 135 See below, at 166.

of such rights would be possible due to the special needs of society at a given time and place – as those needs are ref ected in sub-constitutional law (a statute or the common law). T is point was noted in one case:

> T e limitation clause … constitutes a central feature of human-rights protection. T e role of the limitation is twofold. It at once protects human rights and enables their limitation. It demonstrates the relative nature of the rights … T e limitation clause is the peg on which the constitutional system balances between the individual and the community, between the individual and society as a whole. It ref ects the notion that alongside human rights we may f nd human obligations; that alongside each member's right stands their obligations towards their fellow man and towards society as a whole. 136

 Indeed, Robinson Crusoe never needed constitutional (or other) rights. T e very existence of constitutional rights assumes the existence of a human society, as well as a limitation on the wants and needs of its members. Such limitations are set by the limitation clause – and the requirements of proportionality at its center. Proportionality, therefore, represents the notion that the individual lives within a society and is a part thereof; that the very existence of that society – its needs, as well as its tradition – may provide a justif cation to the limitation of human rights through laws that are proportional. Constitutional rights are rights of the individual as part of the society; accordingly, they may be limited by sub-constitutional laws serving proper social goals.

# 2. Protecting human rights and recognizing the constitutionality of their limitations

T e limitation clause – and the proportionality requirements at its center – fulf lls a dual role in constitutional democracies: It both protects constitutional rights and provides a justif cation for their limitation. Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court wrote in Oakes in relation to the Canadian limitation clause:

> It is important to observe at the outset that Section 1 has two functions: f rst, it constitutionally guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and second, it states explicitly the exclusive justif catory criteria … against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be measured. 137

> > 136 Mizrahi Bank , above note 133, at 239. 137 R . v. Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103, 135.

### 166 Proportionality: sources, nature, function

 Just like the Roman god Janus, the limitation clause has two faces: the protection and justif cation of limitation. 138

# 3. Both the right and its limitations stem from a shared source

T e "two-face" metaphor may point to the central feature of the limitation clause: T e constitutional right on the one hand, and its limitations (by sub-constitutional laws) on the other, are the two sides of the same constitutional idea. T ey stem from a common source and advance common values. As Chief Justice Dickson noted in Oakes :

> T e underlying values and principles of a free and democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or freedom must be shown, despite its ef ect, to be reasonable and demonstrably justif ed. 139

T ese ideas were echoed in United Mizrahi Bank :

T e constitutional right and its limitation stem from a common source … Both the right and its limitations are subservient to the fundamental principles on which the Basic Law is founded (Article 1), and its goals (Articles 1a, 2). 140

T e constitutional right is entrenched in the constitution, and the authority regarding its limitation is entrenched in the constitution. Moreover, the same constitutional principles justifying the recognition of constitutional rights equally justify the recognition of the legal possibility of justifying the limitation of those rights through sub-constitutional laws. As Woolman and Botha have noted, in the South African context:

> [T]he same values that inform our understanding of what constitutes a justif able limitation on a right – openness, democracy, dignity, equality, and freedom – also f esh out the extension of the individual rights themselves. 141

# 4. T e limits on constitutional limitations

T e limitation clause expresses the notion of the relative – as opposed to absolute – nature of constitutional rights. 142 It does so by providing

constitutional status both to the right and to the power to limit its exercise by a sub-constitutional law. One of the most important features of the limitation clause is that even the limitations have limits. As Alexy noted:

> T e principled nature of constitutional rights gives rise not only to the idea that constitutional rights are limited and limitable in light of countervailing principles, but also that their limiting and limitability is itself limited. 143

T e same idea was noted in the Design case:

 Human rights are not absolute; they may be limited. Albeit, those limitations have their own limits. T ose boundaries are set by the limitation clause. 144

T is notion of "limits on limitations" 145 is of utmost importance. It lies at the very foundation of constitutional democracy. It is the legal basis for the limitation of the legislative power in relation to the limitation of human rights. In the same way that human rights require a thorough study, so too do their limitations.

# **D. Limitation clause and the override**

# 1. T e nature of the override

T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms includes an override clause. T e clause states:

- (1) Parliament or the legislature of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 to 15 of this Charter.
- (2) An Act or a provision of an act in respect of which a declaration made under this section is in ef ect shall have such operation as it would have but for the provision of this Charter referred to in the declaration.
- (3) A declaration made under subsection (1) shall cease to have ef ect f ve years af er it comes into force or on such earlier date as may be specif ed in the declaration.

- (4) Parliament or the legislature of a province may re-enact a declaration made under subsection (1).
- (5) Subsection (3) applies in respect of a re-enactment made under subsection (4). 146

 Inf uenced by that provision, and as part of a political compromise, the Israeli Knesset also constituted a special override provision in one of the Basic Laws. T at provision, found in Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation, states:

> A provision of a law that violates freedom of occupation shall be of ef ect, even though not in accordance with Article 4, if it has been included in a law passed by a majority of the members of the Knesset, which expressly states that it shall be of ef ect, notwithstanding the provisions of this Basic Law; such law shall expire four years from its commencement unless a shorter duration has been stated therein. 147

T e override clause provides that, even if the "override" legislation is disproportional, it is still valid. In essence, it grants a statute fulf lling certain conditions "immunity" from judicial review.

 Despite the similarities between the two provisions, the Israeli override clause seems to better protect human rights than its Canadian counterpart in the following ways. First, it applies only to one constitutional right – freedom of occupation – rather than to several rights included within the Canadian Charter. Despite this, even in Canada the clause does not apply to all constitutional rights. Second, in Israel, a majority of Members of Parliament is required to enact an "overriding"

Amongst other things, it determines (Art. 31(4)): "It is the intention of Parliament that an override declaration will only be made in exceptional circumstances." For a critique of the latter, see J. Debeljak, "Balancing Rights in a Democracy: T e Problems with Limitations and Overrides of Rights under the Victorian Charter of

statute; such a requirement does not appear in Canada. T ird, in Israel, such "overriding" legislation expires within four years of its enactment. T e statute, in other words, has a limited lifespan ("sunset provisions"). In Canada, the statute is not limited in time; rather, the constitutional protection from judicial review is temporary – it expires af er f ve years. T e statute itself, however, continues to be in ef ect until otherwise ruled. Both systems allow for the renewal of these periods once they have expired.

## 2. T e relationship between the limitation clause and the override

### i. Legal and political limitations

T e formal role of the override clause is similar to that of the limitation clause. Both have constitutional status. Both deal with the limitation of constitutional rights rather than their amendment. Both allow such limitation in a way rendering the limitation valid within the legal system. However, they are markedly dif erent. T e limitation clause expresses both the formal and substantial notions of democracy. It ref ects a delicate balance between the sovereignty of the people – as ref ected by legislation – and constitutional rights. One of the limitation clause's main features is the imposition of legal restraints – in the form of judicial review – on the legislative power of parliament in relation to disproportional limitations of constitutional human rights. In contrast to the limitation clause, the override clause only satisf es the formal notion of democracy. It was designed to provide the people – through its representatives – with the authority to override the proportionality requirements posed by the constitutional limitation clause over the legislator's legislative power. It turns the legal limitations on the legislator into political ones. 148

<sup>148</sup> See HCJ 4676/94 Meatrael v. Minister of Finance [1996] IsrSC 50(5) 15, 26 ("T e purpose of the override clause is to enable the legislator to realize its social and political ends, even if those limit the rights included in Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation and such limitation does not meet the requirements set by the limitation clause … T e override clause enables the legislator to achieve through legislation social and political ends without the fear that such legislation would be declared invalid by judicial review … T e override clause preserves the status of the Basic Law as a constitutional norm, while at the same time granting the legislator the powers to limit the rights therein included without the need to abide by the requirements set by the limitation clause; all that, without the need to amend the Basic Law itself." (Barak, P.)).

T e override clause was initially formulated in Canada as a result of political compromise. 149 Today it is seen as a new constitutional institution, 150 striking a new balance between past and present, between the legislative and the judicial branches. 151 Indeed, the override clause creates a dialogue between the legislator and the judge. Some view it as a new form of "sof " constitutionalism, 152 providing a wanted response to the counter-majoritarian claim. 153 T e main reason for that is that the override clause enables the legislator to override the constitutional limitations posed by the limitation clause with regard to human rights without a constitutional amendment. While it is true that the override clause may weaken the institution of judicial review, it does not eliminate it outright. In Canada it only applies to several Articles relating to human rights. It does not allow for institutional arrangements set by the constitution (such as the establishment of three branches of government) to be overridden. In addition, it does not apply to all human rights. For example, it does not apply to the constitutional right to vote or to be elected; it does not apply retroactively; 154 and it may not af ect a res judicata , or a f nal judicial decision. It is time-sensitive. Finally, it requires that the legislator declare that they are aware that the limitation of the constitutional right is not proportional. 155

 Is the override clause worthy? Would it be proper to include it in the constitution? T e answer dif ers from one democratic society to another and from one legal system to the next. One of the main issues to consider is what would be the alternative to the inclusion of an override clause, as well as how of en it would actually be put to use by the legislator. We cannot compare a well-def ned and, indeed, rare use of the clause – as

done, for example, in Canada 156 – with a repeated, unlimited use of the clause, 157 or, worse yet, such a comprehensive use of the clause that would render all human rights superf uous. 158 In Israel, for example, as part of the national compromise relating to a new constitution, it would be possible to consider the inclusion of a general override clause, like the one currently appearing only within Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. T is might be a risky move; then again, what is the alternative?

### ii. T e relationship between the limitation clause and the override

T e override clause assumes that a statute may limit a constitutional right disproportionally. Despite that, the legislator sees a need for this disproportional statute, and therefore the statute needs the constitutional protection (or "immunity") of ered by the override. How would the legislator know that the act is disproportional? One way is through a judicial decision to that ef ect. Another is the fear of the likelihood of such a decision, even before it is handed down.

 In both Canada and Israel, the requirements of proportionality apply to all constitutional rights. T is is not the case with the override. It does not have a general application. A special issue may arise when one statutory limitation may af ect several constitutional rights, some of which are governed by the override while others are not. Take, for example, a statutory provision limiting the constitutional right of freedom of occupation (which is governed in Israel by the override) which may simultaneously limit the right to property (which is not subject in Israel to the override). Assume that the limitation is disproportional for both constitutional rights involved. Recall that the override requires that the legislator declare that the statute "shall operate notwithstanding" the existence of a constitutional provision. Once such a declaration has been made, the override is triggered, but only in relation to the relevant constitutional rights (that is, those rights that the clause governs). T is statute limits a constitutional right (the right to property) – to which the override does not apply – in a disproportional manner. Should we say that the statute is unconstitutional due to its disproportional limitation of a right which is not governed by the override?

<sup>156</sup> See Hogg, above note 146, at 165; Gardbaum, above note 132, at 178. 157 See Gardbaum, above note 152, at 757. 158 See Ford, above note 154.

T is question was considered in Israel in the case of Meatrael . 159 At issue was an Act of Parliament that limited the freedom of occupation of several meat importers. 160 In Israel, the freedom of occupation is both a constitutional right and (the only) right governed by the override clause. For fear that the statute may be limiting the right disproportionally, and therefore may be declared unconstitutional, 161 the statute included a declaration that it "shall operate notwithstanding" the constitutional right to freedom of occupation. 162 T e petitioner, in turn, argued that the statute limited their right to property – another recognized constitutional right in Israel, but one not governed by the override clause. Accordingly, the petitioner argued that the statute should be invalidated as it disproportionally limited a constitutional right not governed by the override clause. It was noted that the "overriding" act in question may be granted constitutional protection within the limits of Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. It is not granted, for that reason alone, protection under Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. Accordingly, there may be situations in which an "overriding" act may be protected from invalidation for the purposes of Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation , but invalid for purposes of the other Basic Law. 163

 Such an approach raises complex interpretive issues in all those cases – and there are many – in which the disproportional means used by the "overriding" legislative provision in question may limit more than one right. How should we determine the relationship between those limitations where, as in this case, some are protected by the override clause, while others are not? In the case, the following guidelines were provided:

> A proper interpretation would provide constitutional protection to an "overriding" legislative provision limiting not only the freedom of occupation but other constitutional rights [as well] … when the three following conditions are met: First, the limitation of other constitutional rights is incidental to, and naturally f ows from, the limitation of the freedom of occupation. Second, the limitation of the freedom of occupation is the primary limitation, while the other limitations are secondary. T ird, the limitation of other constitutional rights, in and of itself, is not substantial. Once these three conditions are met, the proper interpretive result – one which considers the entire constitutional framework as one unif ed

whole, and which seeks constitutional harmony – would be to provide the "override" legislative provision with general protection so that it would be valid beyond the mere provisions of Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. Any other interpretive result would render the override clause superf uous, rendering any use thereof inef ective. A proper interpretation must refrain from such a result. However, the interpretive solution provided here also maintains the proper boundaries of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. It acknowledges the fact that this Basic Law does not contain an override clause, while protecting the rights included therein from a primary limitation that may arise as a result of the enactment of an "overriding" legislative provision. 164

### iii. T e limitations of the override clause

T e override clause provides constitutional protection to any statute that either limits constitutional rights in a disproportional manner or is suspected of doing so. Does that necessarily mean that any deviation from the rules of proportionality, regardless of its scope, would provide constitutional protection to the statute in question? T at question has been considered in the Canadian literature. 165 One view is that the general limitations included in the Canadian limitation clause – according to which all rights and freedoms set out in the Charter are "subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society" 166 – should also apply to the override clause, such that an act of parliament that places "unreasonable" limits on those constitutional rights would not be able to enjoy the protection of the override clause. T e standard used under the limitation clause should be lower. T is view was never adopted by the Canadian courts. Hogg noted – while relying on a series of cases by the Canadian Supreme Court – that the override clause only requires several formal conditions. Accordingly, in his approach, the proportionality requirements and the limitation clause may not apply to such conditions. 167

T e issue was also considered in Israel. According to the text of the Israeli override clause – "a legislative provision limiting the freedom

<sup>164</sup> Ibid ., at 30. 165 See Hogg, above note 146, at 170. See also D. J. Arbess, "Limitations on Legislative Override under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: A Matter of Balancing Values," 21 Osgoode Hall L. J . 113 ( 1983 ); B. Slattery, "Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms – Override Clauses under Art. 33 – Whether Subject to Judicial Review under Art. 1," 61 Can. Bar Rev . 391 ( 1983 ). 166 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1, above note 7. 167 Hogg, above note 146, at 170.

of occupation shall remain in ef ect, even if it is not in accordance with Article 4 of this Basic Law" – it is clear that the constitutional protection would not be lif ed merely because the act in question is disproportional. In fact, according to its text, the Israeli override clause is triggered when the "overriding" provision is disproportional. But what is the proper relationship between the override and the constitutional provisions relating to the principles of the Basic Law, 168 as well as to its purposes? 169 In Meatrael the argument that such "principles" may outweigh the provisions of the override clause was not ruled out:

> Even if we assume, arguendo , that some basic values and purposes are so fundamental that even an "overriding" provision may not limit them, then these are obviously the same basic values and purposes upon which our entire constitutional structure – including our Basic Laws – is built. T e limitation of such principles should be substantial and concrete … otherwise, the entire override clause would be rendered superf uous. T is is not the case before us. 170

 Accordingly, it may be argued that the override is not helpful whenever a similar constitutional amendment would be deemed unconstitutional. T e discussion regarding the question of whether every constitutional amendment is constitutional is beyond the scope of this book. If the legal system recognizes the legal possibility of "unconstitutional constitutional amendments," 171 such recognition may limit the use of the override clause. T us, the override clause may not be used to bring in, through the "back door," a new constitutional order that – had it been entered through the "front door" of constitutional amendment – would have been deemed unconstitutional.

# T e historical origins of proportionality

### **A. Proportionality: in life and in the law**

### 1. On the philosophical origins of proportionality

 Proportionality is a worthy quality to possess in one's day-to-day life. It ref ects life experience and careful reasoning. 1 It is an embodiment of the notion of justice and can therefore be found in the image of Lady Justice holding scales. 2 It is also an expression of rational thinking. 3 We demand of ourselves and others to act proportionally. We require that the punishment be proportional to the of ense. 4 T erefore, an "eye for an eye" was considered a measured response. 5 In the Jewish religious sources we f nd the Golden Rule which says: "T at which is hateful to you, do not do to your fellow." 6 T e notion of proportionality has inspired thinkers throughout the generations. 7 T e classical Greek notions of corrective justice ( justitia vindicativa ) and distributive justice ( justitia distributiva ) have also contributed to the development of proportionality as a rational

See Graham v. Florida , 560 US (2010) (Slip. Op. at 8) ("T e concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment. Embodied in the Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishments is the 'precept of justice that punishment for crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] of ense.'"). 5

See Exodus 21:23–25 ("But if any harm follow [when men strive together], then thou shalt give life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe."). T e term appears several more times in the Jewish Bible. See M. Miller, Eye for an Eye (Cambridge University Press, 2006 ); M. J. Fish, "An Eye for an Eye: Proportionality as a Moral Principle of Punishment," 28 OJLS 57 ( 2008 ).

concept. 8 Early Roman law recognized the notion as well. 9 By 1215, the Magna Carta had already recognized the principle in writing:

> For a trivial of ence a free man shall be f ned only in proportion to the degree of his of ense, and for a serious of ence correspondingly but not so heavily as to deprive him of his livelihood. 10

T e writings of St. T omas Aquinas made a signif cant contribution to the development of the notion of proportionality. 11 During the Middle Ages, the international law doctrine of "Just War" made use of the term. According to the doctrine, there was a need to balance the overall utility of the war with the damage it may inf ict. 12

### 2. Proportionality and the Enlightenment

T e development of the concept of proportionality is inexorably linked to the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century and the notion of the social contract. T ese new developments viewed the relationships between citizens and their ruler in an entirely new light: It was the citizens who provided their ruler with powers – limited powers – and those powers were granted only if they would be used for the people's benef t, not the ruler's. T ese notions were echoed in the law. T us, for example, Sir William Blackstone notes in his famous commentaries that the concept of civil liberty should be found only within "natural liberty so far restrained by

human laws (and not farther) as is necessary and expedient for the general advantage of the public." 13

T e concept of proportionality is also linked to the notion of the liberal state, which emerged in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century. According to this notion, not every purpose that serves the public interest is justif ed when it also limits fundamental human rights. Finally, the development of the concept of proportionality is connected to some aspects of natural law.

## 3. Proportionality as counter-formalism

 During the end of the nineteenth century and the f rst half of the twentieth century, the development of the concept of proportionality was seen as part of the more general move in German law from the jurisprudence of concepts ( Begrif sjurisprudenz ) to the jurisprudence of interests ( Interessenjurisprudenz ). Proportionality has also shared several features with the realist trends in Continental European law, as well as with the then-nascent notion of legal positivism – although it should not be seen as emerging from either. At the center of development of the concept of proportionality stood the need for and the will to protect human rights from the powers of the state. 14

### 4. T e contribution of Carl Gottlieb Svarez

T e historical roots of proportionality as a public-law standard can be found in eighteenth-century German administrative law. According to most German commentators today, it was Carl Gottlieb Svarez (1746–1798) who, more than anyone else, contributed to the development of modern proportionality. 15 Svarez was the principal draf er of the Prussian Civil Code of 1794 ( Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preußishen ).

<sup>13</sup> W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (Oxford: Clarendon Press,

 <sup>1765 ), 125. 14</sup> See M. Cohen-Eliya and I. Porat, "American Balancing and German Proportionality: T e

Historical Origins," 8 Int'l J. Const. L . 263 ( 2010 ). 15 See L. Hirschberg, Der Grundsatz Der Verhältnismäßigkeit (G ö ttingen: Schwarz, 1980 ); K. Stern, "Zur Entstehung und Ableitung des Übermaßverbots," in P. Badura and R. Scholz (eds.), Festschrif fur Peter Lerche zum 65 Geburtstag (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1993 ), 165; D. P. Currie, T e Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany (University of Chicago Press, 1994 ), 307; A. Stone Sweet and J. Mathews, "Proportionality, Balancing and Global Constitutionalism," 47 Colum. J. Transnat'l L . 72 (2009).

In a series of lectures he gave between 1791 and 1792 (known as the Kronprinzenvortage ), Svarez noted, in accordance with the principal tenets of the Enlightenment, that the state may only limit the liberty of one subject in order to guarantee the freedom and safety of others. More specif cally, Svarez emphasized the "minimum relationship" that has to exist between the social hardship to be averted and the limitation on one's "natural freedom." As he wrote:

> Only the achievement of a weightier good for the whole can justify the state in demanding from the individual the sacrif ce of a less substantial good. So long as the dif erence in weights is not obvious, the natural freedom must prevail … T e [social] hardship, which is to be averted through the restriction of the freedom of the individual, has to be more substantial by a wide margin than the disadvantage to the individual or the whole that results from the infringement. 16

 Svarez viewed these requirements as expressions of both reasonableness and justice – principles dominant in a legal system which recognizes the natural right of the individual to freedom. Despite his substantial contribution to the concept, Svarez himself never used the term "proportionality" ( Verhaltnismassigkeit ) in his writings. 17

# **B. Te development of proportionality in German public law**

# 1. Proportionality in German administrative law, 1800–1933

 Proportionality as a positive legal concept – as opposed to Svarez' ideal social notion – began appearing in Prussian administrative law in the second half of the nineteenth century. 18 T e term proportionality ( Verhältnismäßigkeit ) is f rst seen in German administrative law literature towards the end of the eighteenth century. 19 At the time, proportionality was discussed in the context of police laws ( Polizeirecht ), which served as the general framework of Prussian administrative law. T e concept itself,

however, was mainly developed by the Supreme Administrative Court of Prussia ( Preußishes Oberverwaltungsgericht ). 20 In a long line of cases, the court ruled that police conduct was illegal because it was disproportional. One of those cases was that of a store owner who violated his store's liquor license several times. In response, the police ordered a closure of the entire store. T e court overruled the police order, explaining that a complete closure was a disproportional sanction in the case, given the clear option of revoking the store's liquor license. 21 In another case, the court examined a property owner who built a fence on his property. T e fence was not visible at night, creating a potential risk for pedestrians. T e police, in response, ordered the owner to remove the entire fence. T e court ruled against the police, suggesting that a less drastic measure was called for, such as requiring the owner to install proper lighting to eliminate the risk. 22 In 1928, Fleiner properly summarized the law of proportionality of the time, when he said: "You should never use a cannon to kill a sparrow." 23 T e development of proportionality continued well into the beginning of the 1930s. It continued throughout the Weimar Republic, and ended with the rise to power of the Nazi party.

### 2. T e development of proportionality in German constitutional law post-Second World War

T e Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany does not contain any explicit provision relating to proportionality. 24 Other than the absolute right to human dignity ( Würde des Menschen ), 25 all the rights mentioned by the Basic Law are relative. Some of the rights have no explicit limitation clauses, while others may only be limited "by law" ( durch Gesetz ). 26

- ist unantsbar." 26 See Art. 12(I) and 14(I) of the Basic Law.

Some contain their own specif c limitation clause. Regardless, since the day it was established, the German Constitutional Court has been strict in following the notion that all rights included in the Basic Law – other than the right to human dignity – are bound by the concept of proportionality and all of its components. T e meaning of this statement is that, in each case, the court must f nd a proper purpose and a rational connection between the means used by the limiting statute and the proper purpose, the absence of less intrusive means, and a proper balance between the limitation on the right and the benef t gained by the limiting statute. 27 T e case of Secret Tape Recordings of 1973 28 may serve as a useful example. T ere, the Constitutional Court considered whether a recording made without the knowledge and consent of the speaker may serve as evidence in a court of law. T e court ruled that the use of such a recording limits the right to the "free development of his personality," which is protected by Article 2(1) of the Basic Law. As to the constitutionality of such a limitation, the court said:

> It is not the entire sphere of private life which falls under the absolute protection of the basic right under Article 2(1) in conjunction with Article 1(1) of the Basic Law … T e individual, as part of a community, rather has to accept such state interventions which are based on an overriding community interest under the strict application of the principle of proportionality, as long as they do not af ect the inviolate sphere of private life. 29

 In a long line of cases, the German Constitutional Court emphasized the importance of proportionality. Similar developments followed in German administrative law 30 and in other f elds of law.

T e German approach to proportionality expanded beyond Germany. T is is one of the prime examples of migration 31 – or transplantation 32 – of

constitutional models in the modern legal age. Indeed, it is possible to argue, together with Weinrib, that proportionality is the post-war paradigm of human rights protection. 33 Today, proportionality serves as a major component of the constitutional model shared by many democracies. 34 It consists – in the words of Law – of a part of the "generic constitutional law," 35 and, within it, "generic constitutional analysis." 36 It is a part of the shared constitutional discourse, prevalent among jurists. 37 In some cases, af er migrating to a new legal system, the concept of proportionality retained all of the components of the German approach. In other cases, the receiving legal system adopted only some components while rejecting others. Even within a given common component (e.g., balancing), dif erent legal systems may give the component dif erent meanings. 38 Many legal systems use proportionality today, while f lling it with their own content. Still, the systems are very similar. We will now examine in further detail the migration or transplantation of the legal concept of proportionality. 39 A general depiction of the migration can be seen in Figure 1.

documents according to which they were established. T us, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms established the European Court of Human Rights, which sits in Strasbourg. T e establishing treaties of the European Union are interpreted and operated by the European Court of Justice, which sits in Luxembourg. T e relationships between the member states' courts and these European courts are complex and elaborate; 43 an examination of these relationships is beyond the scope of this book. Importantly, however, a reciprocal movement of ideas exists between the member states' courts and the European courts. T us, legal doctrines developed by the European courts are of en adopted by several of the member states, while doctrines developed by a member state court may later be adopted by the European courts. 44

### 2. Proportionality and the European Convention on Human Rights

T e European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is the principal shared human rights text in Europe. T e Convention recognizes a list of human rights. It does not explicitly recognize the concept of proportionality. Some of the rights are accompanied by a specif c limitation clause, which determines the criterion according to which those rights may be limited. 45 T is criterion requires that a limitation of a right be done only to the extent "necessary in a democratic society." 46 Other rights – not accompanied by a specif c limitation clause – were also interpreted as relative rights, 47 other than the prohibition of torture. 48 According to the European Court of Human Rights, the concept of proportionality – with all its components, including

<sup>43</sup> See A. Torres P é rez, Conf icts of Rights in the European Union: A T eory of Supranational Adjudication (Oxford University Press, 2009 ). 44 See Helen Keller and Alec Stone-Sweet (eds.), A Europe of Rights: T e Impact of the ECHR

proportionality stricto sensu (balancing) – is a central feature of human rights according to the Convention. 49

 When was the f rst time that proportionality appeared in a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights? Somewhat surprisingly, an authoritative answer to this question is not readily available; it requires an intense historical survey which is beyond the scope of this book. According to Eissen, 50 the f rst decision to include a discussion of proportionality was in the case of Handyside in 1976. 51 In this freedom of expression case, the court ruled, inter alia :

> [E]very "formality," "condition," "restriction," or penalty imposed in this sphere must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. 52

T e inspiration for this wording came from judgments of the German Constitutional Court relating to proportionality. 53

### 3. Proportionality in the law of the European Union

T e term "proportionality" is not mentioned in the constituent documents that establish the law of the European Union. T e concept was developed

by the European Court of Justice. T e Court of Justice developed the concept both in matters relating to review of EU institutions and in matters where a member state court referred a legal question to the Court of Justice to be determined in accordance with the principles of European law. T is was done in light of the Court of Justice's recognition – following notions of French law – of general principles of law that exist alongside the formal written texts. 54 Among those general principles are the protection of human rights, the fulf llment of legitimate expectations, 55 the basic principles of natural justice and the principles of the rule of law. T e concept of proportionality was given a central place among those principles. 56 According to most commentators, the concept was adopted by the European Court of Justice as inf uenced by German law. 57

T e concept of proportionality was initially explored by the European Court of Justice in a series of cases from the 1950s and 1960s. It was fully developed, however, in the 1970 in the case of Internationale Handelsgesellschaf . 58 T e Advocate General on the case, Dutheillat de Lamonthe, thoroughly examined the concept of proportionality and found that it had roots in the documents establishing the European Union. T e Court accepted his position. In that case, the Court examined a challenge to a direction of the European Economic Community that allegedly violated a human right. T is approach was expanded early in the 1980s, when the court was willing to examine the congruence between the legislation of the member states and that of the EU. 59

 In 2004, a draf of the Treaty Establishing a Constitution for Europe was accepted by representatives of twenty-f ve member states. 60 According to the draf , this attempt at a European Constitution contained a bill of rights. T ose rights were phrased as "absolute"; however, some were accompanied by specif c limitation clauses, and all were governed by a general limitation clause (Article 112(1) of the Treaty), which read:

> Any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognized by this Charter must be provided for by law and respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. Subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations may be made only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognized by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.

 Not all member states of the European Union approved this draf . Instead, the Treaty of Lisbon was prepared by the member states in 2007 and entered into force on December 1, 2009. 61 Article 3b(4) of the Lisbon Treaty reads: "Under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of Union action shall not exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties." T is ratif ed clause demonstrates the centrality of proportionality in EU law today. Further, the Lisbon Treaty gave ef ect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and to its general limitation clause. 62

## **D. From European law to Western European states' law**

countries, the concept of proportionality was explicitly included as part of a constitutional limitation clause in the chapter on human rights. 72

### **E. From European law to Canada, Ireland, and England**

### 1. Canada

 Until the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms of 1982, 73 the Canadian Supreme Court did not recognize the concept of proportionality as part of Canadian human rights law. Initially, the Canadian Constitution, included in the Constitution Act of 1867, did not include a chapter on human rights. In 1960, when the Canadian Bill of Rights was enacted, it was devised as a regular statute; the bill did not enjoy a constitutional status, and its interpretation did not include the concept of proportionality. 74 All that changed in 1982, when the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was constituted. T e Charter is now constitutional. It contains an explicit provision rendering any legislation conf icting with the Charter as "of no force and ef ect," 75 which the Canadian courts may declare and enforce. 76 Alongside the recognition of several human rights, Article 1 of the Charter includes a general limitation clause, 77 as follows:

> T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society.

 What is the meaning of the requirement that human rights may be limited only in a "reasonable" manner, such that "can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society"? When reviewing this provision in 1985, Hogg referred to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and its interpretation by

letter and spirit of the Constitution and the requirements of the democratic order of the society and the secular Republic and the principle of proportionality." See also Y. Ogurlu, "A Comparative Study on the Principle of Proportionality in Turkish Administrative

Law," Kamu Hukuku Arşivi, Khuk 5 ( 2003 ). 72 See Art. 13 of the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey (above note 71); Art. 5(2) of the

Federal Constitution of Switzerland (above note 70). 73 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act 1982.

the European Court of Human Rights. 78 In particular, Hogg noted the Sunday Times case of 1979. 79 He added:

> In applying Section 1 of the Charter, Canadian courts will have to follow a reasoning process similar to that employed in the Sunday Times case. T e word "reasonable" in Section 1 requires that a limit on Charter rights be rationally related to a legitimate purpose. T e word "reasonable" also contains within it an idea of proportionality. In the Sunday Times case, the court acknowledged the legitimacy of the governmental purpose of protecting the courts from undue public pressure, but held that the suppression of all speech relating to ongoing litigation was a disproportionately severe restraint. T e same kind of reasoning would be put under Section 1. 80

 Barely a year af er Hogg's review, the Canadian Supreme Court issued its decision in Oakes . 81 Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Dickson provided an analysis of Article 1 and adopted a "form of proportionality test." 82 In particular, the Chief Justice ruled that "reasonable" limitations that can be "demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society" require a "suf ciently signif cant objective" and a proportional means used to achieve it. T e "signif cant objective" must "relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial." T e proportionality of the relationship will be determined through the following three tests. First, the means should be "rationally connected to the objective." Second, the means should impair "as little as possible" the right or freedom in question. T ird, there should be a proportional relation between the ef ects on the rights of the means chosen and the objective identif ed as having suf cient importance. 83 T us, the proportionality adopted by the Canadian Court closely followed the understanding of the European Court of Human Rights

### 2. Ireland

T e Constitution of Ireland (1937) is familiar with judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes. It contains a chapter on fundamental rights; however, it does not contain a general limitation clause. 86 Specif c limitation clauses 87 include the objective for which a limitation on the right is permissible. Several rights were allowed to be limited "in accordance with law." Several others, however, may be limited without an express

limitation. T e Constitution of Ireland does not expressly mention proportionality. Article 40(3) of the Constitution reads:

- (1) T e State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.
- (2) T e State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.

 Interpreting this provision, the Supreme Court of Ireland has ruled that the Constitution also guarantees the protection of several rights not expressly mentioned by its text. 88 Naturally, the Constitution contains no provisions as to the limitation of these rights.

 Proportionality was accepted by the Irish courts in the early 1990s, though initially this was done without explicit acknowledgment of the term. 89 Later on, the Irish Supreme Court referred explicitly to the concept of proportionality as then accepted by the European Court of Human Rights and the Supreme Court of Canada. 90 In the 1994 case of Heaney , Judge Costello of the Irish Supreme Court provided an analysis of proportionality in a manner resembling that of Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court:

> T e objective of the impugned provision must be of suf cient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right. It must relate to concerns pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society. T e means chosen must pass a proportionality test . T ey must: (a) be rationally connected to the objective and not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations; (b) impair the right as little as possible, and (c) be such that their ef ects on rights are proportional to the objective. 91

 Judge Costello relied on both the Canadian and the European Court of Human Rights' decisions when approaching the analysis of proportionality. 92 Since that decision, Irish courts of en turn to proportionality within

constitutional law. 93T e development in administrative law, however, was not as swif . Some of the dif culties in adapting proportionality to administrative law were related to the relationship between proportionality and the reasonableness requirement. Notwithstanding these dif culties, however, most commentators consider proportionality today as part of Irish administrative law as well. 94

### 3. United Kingdom

 Much like in Ireland, the integration of the principle of proportionality into United Kingdom law was anything but straightforward. 95 Most dif culties, here too, stemmed from English law's wide recognition of the principle of reasonableness as it was adopted in the 1940s following the case of Wednesbury . 96 For many, proportionality seemed not only unwarranted, but potentially damaging. Several attempts to adopt proportionality were made during the 1970s and 1980s. T ese were met with great enthusiasm from some, and harsh criticism from others. 97 T us, for example, in one mid-1980s case, Lord Diplock raised the possibility of accepting the concept, which was already adopted by several European states, but ultimately decided to leave the question open. 98 Another Judge saw proportionality as a dangerous option. 99 In another case, from 1991, the House of Lords was specif cally asked to adopt the concept – and refused, although it did leave the door open for the future adoption of the principle. 100 Lord

 Ackner noted that, so long as the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms was not part of the law of the United Kingdom, there is no legal basis for the adoption of proportionality in the United Kingdom. T e legal literature, however, continued to examine the question. 101

 In 1998, the United Kingdom adopted the Human Rights Act (HRA) of 1998. 102 T at Act gave ef ect, in the United Kingdom, to rights provided in the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. T e Act provided English courts with the authority to declare whether a provision of primary or subordinate legislation in England is compatible with those rights. Such a declaration may apply to laws adopted either before or af er the HRA was adopted. 103 T is Act had a profound ef ect on the legal landscape in the United Kingdom. 104 It also introduced proportionality into English law. 105 Accordingly, the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European concept of proportionality is clear and well established. Over time, the concept expanded to other f elds of law, beyond those covered by the HRA. Today, the exact

### **F. From Canada to New Zealand and Australia**

# 1. New Zealand

 For many years, human rights were an integral part of New Zealand's common law. T e courts creating those rights, however, were not familiar with the concept of proportionality. As with every other Commonwealth jurisdiction, in New Zealand, too, the view for many years had been that any legislation can overcome any rights recognized by the common law. T e latter was challenged by Judge Robin Cooke, then the President of the Court of Appeal, both from the bench, 107 and in an article he published. 108 President Cooke wrote that ordinary legislation challenging the most basic common law human rights may be unconstitutional and may be invalidated by the courts. T is approach, however, was not adopted by other judges. Instead, the ef orts were directed at adopting a constitutional bill of rights. Spearheading the ef ort was the New Zealand government, headed by Palmer. T is attempt, too, failed. 109 Instead, New Zealand adopted the Bill of Rights Act in 1990. 110 T e Act incorporated many facets of the governmental proposals, while also making the necessary changes from constitutional charter to ordinary legislation. T e new Bill of Rights Act adopted many parts of the Canadian Charter, including a general limitation clause:

> Subject to Section 4 of this Bill of Rights, the rights and freedoms contained in this Bill of Rights may be subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society. 111

<sup>111</sup> Ibid ., at Art. 5.

 Section 4 of the Act, which is mentioned in the limitation clause, states that:

Section 4 of the Bill of Rights Act states, in turn:

 No court shall, in relation to any enactment (whether passed or made before or af er the commencement of this Bill of Rights) … hold any provision of the enactment to be impliedly repealed or revoked, or to be in any way invalid or inef ective … by reason only that the provision is inconsistent with any provision of this Bill of Rights.

T e adoption of the general limitation clause led to the adoption of the concept of proportionality in New Zealand law. Today, proportionality is a staple of human rights law in New Zealand. 112 As for administrative law, the question remains open as to whether proportionality replaced the notion of reasonableness, or whether the two exist side by side. 113

## 2. Australia

T e Australian Federal Constitution, which recognizes judicial review on the constitutionality of legislation, is mostly institutional in nature. It does not contain a separate bill of rights. Despite that, the Australian High Court recognized the political freedom of expression as an implied right

with a constitutional status. 114 T e court held that the right is not absolute and that it may be limited with the help of proportionality. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the Canadian cases, Oakes115 in particular. T e Australian High Court referred to proportionality in other contexts as well. 116 T e main issue in Australia, yet to be resolved, concerns proportionality's proper role in administrative law – the same issue that exists in the United Kingdom, 117 New Zealand, 118 and Ireland. 119

constitutions of Canada, New Zealand, and South Africa. It should be assumed that this limitation clause – which is structurally similar to the one in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa – will be interpreted as adopting proportionality. Another Australian development is the enactment of the Human Rights Act of 2004, which applies to the Australian Capital Territory only. T ose rights are not of a constitutional status.

# **G. From Canada and Germany to South Africa**

 A general limitation clause appears in both South Africa's Interim Constitution of 1993 and its Final Constitution. 121 Both of those clauses were inf uenced by the limitation clause in the Canadian Charter on Rights and Freedoms. 122 It is no wonder, therefore, that in interpreting these clauses the South African Constitutional Court relies on the judgment of the Canadian Supreme Court. Analyzing the similarities between the two systems' limitation clauses, Woolman and Botha emphasized the central role of proportionality:

> Limitations analysis under the Charter and our Bill of Rights possesses such common features as … proportionality assessment that demands, at a minimum, that a rational connection exist between the means employed and the objective sought, that the means employed impair the right as "little as possible", and that the burdens imposed on those whose rights are impaired do not outweigh the benef ts to society that f ow from the limitation. 123

 In addition, the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa was inf uenced by German constitutional law. 124 It is important to note, however, that the manner in which proportionality is applied in South African constitutional law is not identical to the way it is used by Canada or

Germany. T e South African approach is less structured. 125 It grants more discretion to the legislator. T us, the South African Constitutional Court has noted that the limitation clause is based on, among others, a careful balancing between the social benef ts gained by the suggested limiting legislation and the damage caused by it to the human right in question.126

### **H. Proportionality migratesto Central and Eastern Europe**

 With the collapse of communism in Central and Eastern Europe, the constitutional structure of those countries changed dramatically. 127 New constitutions were adopted. Special constitutional courts were established, heavily inspired – in structure and jurisdiction – by the model of the German Constitutional Court. 128 Judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation was recognized. And, importantly, each of the new constitutions included a main chapter dedicated to human rights. 129T ose rights are not absolute. T ey can be limited. T us, the new Eastern and Central European constitutions contain limitation clauses. T e typical model among these constitutions is that of a general limitation clause. 130 However, some countries adopted specif c limitation clauses for some of the rights; while others adopted general limitation clauses that would apply only to those rights that the constitution specif ed as limitable. 131

 Very few of those Eastern and Central European constitutions refer explicitly to the concept of proportionality. Only a small number mention proportionality in the context of limitation of human rights. 132 Nonetheless, proportionality is well recognized today in the Eastern

T is is, most likely, a result of the fact that both key international covenants – the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights – are an integral part of Hong Kong's domestic law. 140 T e highest court in Hong Kong, the Court of Final Appeal, has referred on a number of occasions to proportionality in the context of human rights limitations. T ese references have of en been based on the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and the European Court of Human Rights.

T e 1987 Constitution of South Korea includes a special chapter dedicated to human rights. 141 T is chapter includes, alongside several special limitation clauses, a general limitation clause. 142T e Constitutional Court of South Korea is authorized to review – and invalidate – the constitutionality of any law. 143 Using that authority, the Constitutional Court of South Korea has placed proportionality at the center of its constitutional analysis. 144

T e Constitution of India (1950) contains a special part dedicated to fundamental rights. 145 India's Supreme Court is authorized to conduct judicial review and to declare statutes that improperly limit those fundamental rights to be unconstitutional. T e constitution does not contain a general limitation clause; rather, alongside the rights themselves the constitution provides specif c limitation clauses. T ose specif c limitation clauses include the purposes for which restrictions may be imposed on those rights. T ey also state that those limitations must be "reasonable." 146 T e Supreme Court established the criteria for determining the reasonableness of such restrictions. 147 While not mentioning proportionality by its name, the Court has concluded that the factors that should be considered within those criteria are similar to those constituting

### 2. South America

 Following the inf ltration of proportionality into Europe, in particular into Spain and Portugal, the concept began migrating to South America as well. As a result of Spanish inf uence – and, indirectly that of the German constitutional jurisprudence – proportionality began to emerge in Colombia, 151 Peru, 152 Mexico, 153 Chile, 154 and Argentina. 155 As a result of Portuguese inf uence – and, once again, indirectly inf uenced by German law – proportionality emerged in Brazil. 156 In all those

# **J. Proportionality and international human rightslaw**

# 1. International and national human rights law

 Proportionality is a general concept of international law. 157 It serves several functions. It is a central feature of the laws of self-defense. 158 T is aspect of proportionality is unique in that it comprises part of the relations between nations, a part of the body of rights and duties owed by one nation to another. T is book, however, deals primarily with proportional limitations on human rights. Accordingly, this book focuses on the role of proportionality in international human rights law. 159 T is examination is important, because of the mutual inf uence between international human rights law and the domestic human rights law of dif erent states. 160 International law is indeed one of the main contributors to the shaping of domestic law – mostly

constitutional law – relating to human rights. A classic example is Article 39(1) of the South African Constitution, which reads:

> When interpreting the Bill of Rights, a court, tribunal, or forum … (b) must consider international law.

 Another example is Article 10(2) of the Spanish Constitution (1978), which reads:

> T e principles relating to the fundamental rights and liberties recognized by the Constitution shall be interpreted in conformity with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the international treaties and agreements thereon ratif ed by Spain.

 Simultaneously, the domestic constitutional law regarding human rights af ects the developing understanding of international norms. We are faced, therefore, with the cross-migration of human rights law. T e concept of proportionality, in turn, was developed in much the same way.

# 2. Proportionality and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

 Following the Second World War and the Holocaust, in 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 161 T e Declaration contains a catalogue of human rights. T ose rights are mostly phrased in "absolute" terms. However, the declaration has a general limitation clause:

> In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. 162

T is general limitation clause has served as a template for other clauses (general and specif c) later included in international treaties on human

matter at hand, one would be "imported" from the general law of international human rights. 166

 IHL is meant to protect human rights in situations of armed conf ict. 167 Naturally, these rights – like any other human rights – are not absolute. T ey may be limited. IHL determines the purposes for which the limitation of human rights during an armed conf ict is justif ed. It also determines the means used to obtain such purposes. T ose means are not unlimited either. IHL is based on balancing. 168 T is balancing is conducted within the rules of proportionality. 169

 Accordingly, any limitation on a human right protected by IHL should be proportional. T e actual content of that proportionality may change in accordance with the context of the legal question in which it arises. It seems that a general, uniform, customary rule has yet to be established regarding the application of proportionality in all situations in which human rights may be af ected during an armed conf ict. In addition, it seems that a common element to all proportionality requirements during armed conf ict is proportionality stricto sensu , "the requirement that

T ese considerations are based upon the notions of human rights and human dignity. T e other deals with the military considerations underlying the armed conf ict itself. T ese considerations are based on military needs and the success-oriented military mission … T e balancing between these two sets of considerations is the very basis of the international law of armed conf ict … T e upshot of this balancing is that human rights are protected by the laws of armed conf ict, but not to their fullest extent. T e same is true for the military needs. T ese may be achieved, but not to their fullest extent. Such balancing ref ects the relative nature of human nature as well as the limits of military needs.

During this military activity, innocent civilians may be hurt. T e rule is that any damage caused to innocent civilians as an indirect result of a military action must be proportional." (Barak, P.)).

a proper proportional relationship exists between the military objective and the civilian harm." 170 Further analysis of IHL is beyond the scope of this book, whose content is devoted to the limitation of constitutional rights.

## **K. Has proportionality arrived in America?**

 In several areas of American law one may f nd references to both proportionality and disproportionality. T us, for example, Sullivan and Frase 171 cite numerous instances in which the term "proportional" is used by the federal courts. In addition, they point to several other instances that may also be explained in terms of proportionality. However, these commentators cannot point to a single instance in which the concept of proportionality in its entirety – including its four main components – is adopted by the American courts. T is rule has an important exception: in a series of cases, Justice Breyer – in dissenting opinions – ruled that, in certain circumstances, the American Supreme Court had actually turned to a balancing test between competing interests, which included asking whether the limitation of a constitutional right is not proportional. 172 For example, Justice Breyer wrote in a campaign-f nance-related case:

> In such circumstances – where a law signif cantly implicates competing constitutionally protected interests in complex ways – the Court has closely scrutinized the statute's impact on those interests, but refrained from employing a simple test that ef ectively presumes unconstitutionality. Rather, it has balanced interests. And in practice that has meant asking whether the statute burdens any one such interest in a manner out of proportion to the statute's salutary ef ects upon the others ( perhaps,

but not necessarily, because of the existence of a clearly superior, less restrictive alternative). 173

 In another case, the American Supreme Court examined the scope of the Second Amendment to the American Constitution, which deals with the right to bear arms. Justice Breyer wrote in his dissent:

> [A]ny attempt in theory to apply strict scrutiny to gun regulations will in practice turn into an interest-balancing inquiry, with the interests protected by the Second Amendment on one side and the governmental public-safety concerns on the other, the only question being whether the regulation at issue impermissibly burdens the former in the course of advancing the latter. I would simply adopt such an interest-balancing inquiry explicitly. T e fact that important interests lie on both sides of the constitutional equation suggests that review of gun-control regulation is not a context in which a court should ef ectively presume either constitutionality (as in rationalbasis review) or unconstitutionality (as in strict scrutiny). 174

Justice Breyer continued:

 Contrary to the majority's unsupported suggestion that this sort of proportionality approach is unprecedented … the Court has applied it in various constitutional contexts. 175

 Proportionality components – with balancing between the benef ts of fulf lling the law and the harm to the constitutional right in their center – have been recognized by American law in the past. Subjects wherein today the balancing is missing – such as freedom of expression – were formally regulated by the judicial approach which balances between benef t and harm. T erefore, the recognition of proportionality and the balancing at its center does not amount to the penetration of a foreign factor into American law. 176 However, Justice Breyer's approach, which recognizes proportionality and all of its components as a constitutional concept which can stand on its own and which applies in the dif erent f elds of the Bill of Rights, is an innovation in American constitutional law. 177 It

will require a review of both the scope of the constitutional right as well as the justif cation for its limitation. Is American constitutional law ready for this change? 178

### **L. Proportionality in Israel**

T e four components that together make up the requirements of proportionality have played, for many years – albeit separately – an important role in the development of Israel's administrative law. T at is the case for the requirement of a proper purpose; for the requirement of a rational connection; for the requirement of the least damaging alternative; and for the requirement of a proper balance between the harm caused to the human right and the benef t gained by the public interest. In some cases, each of these components stood on its own. In others, it served as a consideration of the reasonableness test, the standard according to which all administrative and executive actions are reviewed. While developing its own tests – such as that of reasonableness – the Israeli Supreme Court has digressed from English precedents such as Wednesbury . 179 Instead, the Court has placed the reasonableness of the administrative action as a stand-alone, independent test with the balancing of conf icting interests at its core.

 For many years, these separate components have failed to form a single, unif ed administrative rule. T e main sources for the creation of such a rule came from Israeli academia. T e f rst to note proportionality as an independent cause of action was Segal. In an article he published in 1990, 180 Segal argued that "a review of Israeli Supreme Court cases … demonstrates that the Court has created a new cause of administrative review; this cause deals with the lack of proportionality between the means undertaken by the administrative agency and the damage it sought to prevent, or the purpose it sought to obtain." 181 Segal dubbed that

<sup>178</sup> See V. C. Jackson, "Ambivalent Resistance and Comparative Constitutionalism: Opening Up the Conversation on 'Proportionality', Rights and Federalism," 1 U. Pa. J. Const.

Comment . 803, 842 ( 2004 ); Cohen-Eliya and Porat, above note 174; and see below, at 530. 179 For Wednesbury , see above note 96. 180 Z. Segal, "Disproportionality as a Cause of Action in Israeli Administrative Action," 39

HaPraklit 507 ( 1990 ). 181 Ibid ., at 511.

"the cause of disproportionality." 182 Segal then turned to comparative law in order to further develop his opinion. He noted that, "in European law in general, and in French law in particular, this cause of action is a novel one. It began about twenty years ago, and now quickly develops to expand the judicial review of administrative action." 183 Four years later, in 1994, Zamir published a comprehensive article comparing Israel's administrative law to that of Germany. 184 In this article, Zamir introduced to the Israeli legal community for the f rst time the German notion of proportionality. He then expressed his opinion that the Israeli Supreme Court has neglected the use of proportionality. 185 He emphasized that the concept of proportionality was adopted by the court, but remained a "nameless stepchild" of the system, 186 as it always had to "hide" behind other causes of action, such as reasonableness or the balancing of interests. He then expressed the hope that this reason for action "would stand on its own two feet, as an independent cause of action, and would be able to be developed much like the other well-recognized causes." 187

T is hope was quickly realized. It was Zamir himself – this time, Justice Zamir of the Israeli Supreme Court – who recognized the cause of proportionality as an independent cause of action that may be argued against any executive or administrative action. As Justice Zamir wrote:

> Proportionality is an important legal concept, accepted by many nations and in many areas of law – in particular administrative law. It has also been used in Israeli law since its infancy, in several areas, sometimes originating in legislation and sometimes in the common law. Recently, however, proportionality was recognized by this court as a principle that guides and limits the administrative agency while it exercises its authority … More concretely, proportionality is a wide-ranging and fundamental concept that until now, for some reason, has not received the weight and recognition it deserves in Israeli law. 188

It appears in several areas of law … T e concept of proportionality was f rst recognized by Israel's administrative law, but without calling it by its own name … Recently, a more 'formal' recognition was granted to proportionality by the Israeli Supreme Court." (Barak, P.)).

T ese developments occurred mainly in the area of administrative law. Another important development, this time in constitutional law, occurred with the adoption of the two Basic Laws relating to human rights – Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, and Basic Law: Freedom of Occupation. T ese two Basic Laws, which contain a list of constitutional human rights, adopted a general limitation clause. 189 Within that clause, the concept of proportionality is explicitly mentioned ("[the limitation shall be] to an extent no greater than is required"). In my opinion in the case of United Mizrahi Bank – a case that established the constitutional status of these Basic Laws – the sources of the concept of proportionality in Israel were noted:

> In the past we turned to the concept of proportionality as a cause of action in administrative law … Now it has been granted a constitutional status. It is according to this concept that the constitutionality of legislation should be reviewed. T e same has occurred in the laws of other nations: Proportionality began as an administrative law test. Today, this test is well received across the administrative laws of many of the European states … It was developed in particular by the German administrative law … [F]rom there, it migrated to the constitutional law of most of the European states, as well as other states outside Europe. It now serves, for example, as a main feature of Canadian law … and also in South Africa, in accordance with its new constitution. Indeed, a review of the comparative law on proportionality demonstrates an attempt to render the test more concrete. It seems to me that we should learn from that comparative experience, common to Canada, Germany, the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights, as the concept of proportionality does not necessarily ref ect a particular social history unique to a certain nation, or a particular stand on a constitutional issue. Rather, it ref ects a comprehensive analytical view as to the proportionality of the law limiting a constitutional human right.

 Following the comparative experience, proportionality in Israeli law is divided into four components; each of those assumed the interpretation adopted at the time by Canada, Germany, and judicial opinions interpreting the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Today, proportionality constitutes a central feature of Israeli law. It applies not only in constitutional law, but also in administrative law. It has become a central feature of the Israeli public discourse – which refers to the requirement of proportionality more than ever.

# T e legal sources of proportionality

# **A. Proportionality as a criterion forthe realization of constitutionalrights**

### 1. T e need for a constitutional entrenchment

 Any legal system wishing to adopt proportionality as a criterion for properly limiting constitutional rights through sub-constitutional law must provide a legal foundation for such an adoption. 1 It is insuf cient to merely recognize proportionality as a key concept or to simply acknowledge its superiority over other limiting criteria. It would also be insuf cient for the common law to recognize it, or even for statutory provisions to do so. 2 Rather, the only legal basis for the application of proportionality as a criterion for the limitation of constitutional rights by sub-constitutional law must be found in the constitution itself, either explicitly or implicitly. Indeed, in order to properly limit a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law, the law establishing the limitation must rest on a constitutional foundation. What constitutes the constitutional basis of proportionality?

 In Israel, the answer to this question appears straightforward. T e Israeli Basic Laws contain, within their general limitation clauses, a specif c provision stating that any limitation of the constitutional rights established therein must be by law "benef ting the values of the State of

<sup>1</sup> See L. Tremblay, "Normative Foundation of the Proportionality Principle in Constitutional T eory" (French) (EUI Working Papers LAW 2009/04 ); B.

Pulido, El Principio de Proporcionalidad y los Derechos Fundamentales (Centro de Estudios Pol í ticos y Constitucionales, 2007 ), 505.

<sup>2</sup> When the rights are not part of the formal constitution, but embodied in statute or common law, proportionality may be recognized by statute or common law.

See also above, at 159.

Israel, enacted for a proper purpose." 3 In addition, the limitation clauses must be "to an extent no greater than required." A similar provision may be found in several other constitutions. Take, for example, an amendment to the Austrian Constitution from 1988. While subsection (1) of the amended provision establishes a constitutional right to freedom, subsection (3) provides:

> T e deprivation of personal liberty may be legally prescribed only if this is requisite for the purpose of the measure; deprivation of personal liberty may in any instance only occur if and inasmuch as this is not disproportionate to the purpose of the measure.

 Similarly, the new Federal Constitution of Switzerland (2000) contains a general limitation clause (Article 36(3)), which includes the following specif c language:

> Limitations of fundamental rights must be proportionate to the goals pursued. 4

 Another explicit provision relating to proportionality is found in Romania's Constitution (1991) 5 and in an amendment (2001) to the Constitution of the Republic of Turkey. 6 Some other constitutions have included within their limitation clauses (either general or specif c) special provisions requiring that a limitation of a constitutional right be done in a manner that is "necessary" in a democratic society. 7 From the use of this term – "necessary" – the courts have deduced the proportionality requirement. 8

 While the mere existence of specif c provisions in the constitution may advance our inquiry as to the legal foundation of the concept of proportionality, it fails to provide a complete answer. T e reason for that is that the dif erent terms used by the constitutional text – be it "necessary," "not beyond the required amount," "proportional," or others – require interpretation. T e interpretive process raises several questions such as what does it mean to have a limitation that is "necessary," or "not beyond

what is required"? Similar questions arise when the constitutional text specif cally uses the term "proportionality." What is the meaning of that provision? Is it the same as the one used by Canada, Germany, or South Africa? Maybe it is closer to the "reasonableness" requirement, adopted by the administrative laws of common law countries as well as in Israel? Maybe this is a unique proportionality, a sui generis for that specif c legal system?

T e question presented earlier remains unanswered: what is the legal basis of proportionality? What is the foundation of the concept in the constitutional law of the legal system that has adopted it? Beyond that, in some cases, the constitutions in question contain no explicit provisions relating to the proportional limitation of constitutional rights by subconstitutional law. In other cases, all that those constitutions provide is that a limitation should be made only "by law," without referring to any other conditions. 9 Finally, some constitutions contain rights worded as absolute, without any additional guidance as to their limitation. 10 Despite that, all these constitutions were interpreted as requiring a proportional limitation – even without any explicit provision to that ef ect, or where the only provision available merely stated that the limitation should be prescribed "by law." 11 What was the constitutional foundation that such interpretations were based on? Indeed, the answer to the question of what is the constitutional basis of proportionality is critical to an understanding of the concept.

### 2. T e nature of the constitutional entrenchment

 A review of the literature and judicial opinions relating to proportionality suggests that proportionality's constitutional basis may be explained by one of the following four views:

- (a) Proportionality may be derived from the notion of democracy.
- (b) Proportionality is a part of the rule of law.
- (c) Proportionality is inherent to any conf ict between legal principles.
- (d) Proportionality is a likely outcome of harmonious interpretation of the entire constitution.

I review each of these below.

# **B. Proportionality and democracy**

# 1. T e relationship between democracy and proportionality: basic assumptions

 According to the f rst view, the requirement of proportional limitations of constitutional rights by a sub-constitutional law (e.g., a statute or the common law) is derived from an interpretation of the notion of democracy itself. T e argument is based on f ve assumptions. First, the very notion of democracy is of a constitutional status. Second, the constitutional notion of democracy includes – other than the notions of representative democracy and majority rule – an element of human rights. T ird, the constitutional notion of democracy is based on a balance between human rights on the one hand and the principles that representative democracy aims to achieve on the other. It is necessary, therefore, to prove that democracy is based upon a balance between human rights and their limitation. Fourth, that balance, required by the very nature of the notion of democracy, is performed through limitation clauses (general or specif c, explicit or implicit), which renders the limitation of constitutional rights possible by a sub-constitutional law. Fif h, these limitation clauses, in order to properly fulf ll their role, are based on the principle of proportionality. T e principle of proportionality is based on the notion of democracy if and only if each of these f ve assumptions is correct. We turn now to an examination of these assumptions.

# 2. First assumption: democracy is of a constitutional status

T e view that proportionality is derived from the notion of democracy is based on the assumption that the notion of democracy is of a constitutional (supra-legislative) status. T is is so because, if the notion of democracy is merely a ref ection of the sub-constitutional reality, then it would not suf ce to serve as a basis for a norm – or a criterion – operating at the constitutional level.

 Does democracy have a constitutional status? Some constitutions explicitly state that the state is of a democratic nature. T us, for example, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides that the Federal Republic of Germany is a democracy (" ein demokratischer Bundesstaat "). 12

<sup>12</sup> Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Art. 20(1).

A similar provision can be found in other constitutions. 13 T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms declares that it "guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society." 14 A similar provision, relating to an "open and democratic society," appears in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. 15 In Israel, the democratic nature of the state was explicitly mentioned by the Basic Laws relating to human rights, which state that the purpose of these Basic Laws is "to establish in a Basic Law the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state." 16

 What is the normative status of the constitutional determination that a state is "democratic," or that its values are those of a "democratic state," or that its rights may be limited in a manner "justif ed by a democracy"? T ese questions are interpretive in nature. T e term "democracy," as it appears in a constitutional text, must be properly interpreted. Naturally, this interpretation may vary from one legal system to another, from one constitution to the next. Still, the judiciaries in most constitutional democracies adopted the view that the term "democratic" as it appears in the constitution is not merely of a declaratory nature; rather, it has a constitutional-operative meaning as well. It imposes, for example, obligations on the three branches of government. It also serves as an interpretive rule. T erefore, for example, it may be helpful when the question at issue is whether a referendum – which is not mentioned by the constitution – is an institution that is congruent with the constitution. 17 Similarly, it may be helpful when the question presented is: what are the circumstances under which a state belonging to a federation may withdraw from it? 18 T e notion of democracy is also a source that may yield further powers not mentioned explicitly by the constitution itself, but which are intrinsic to its democratic nature. 19 In addition, the notion of democracy may

Ireland, Art. 5; the Constitution of Portugal, Art. 2. 14 T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1. 15 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 36(1).

encompass not only a formal but also a substantial facet. In that case, new human rights, not expressly enumerated by the constitution, may be recognized impliedly by the courts as stemming from the very notion of democracy. 20 Using such an approach, the Supreme Court of Ireland came to recognize the right to freedom of movement, although it is not specifically mentioned by the Irish Constitution. 21 Similarly, the High Court of Australia has recognized the right to freedom of political expression. 22

T e constitution does not always explicitly refer to the term "democracy." In those cases where it does not, should the notion of democracy still be accorded a constitutional status? T e answer is yes. Several basic principles do not appear explicitly in a constitution, but they constitute an integral part of the document and are of constitutional status. 23 Even if those basic principles are not written expressly into the text of the founding democratic document, they appear impliedly between the lines. 24 T ey are implied by the constitutional text and the constitutional structure. 25 T ey constitute a part of the "invisible constitution." 26 Take, for example, the notion of the separation of powers. In most cases, the notion itself is not explicitly referred to in the constitutional text, but it is clearly impliedly included therein. 27 As I have noted elsewhere:

> T e democratic value of separation of powers, and not just the de facto division of authority among the dif erent branches, is itself a constitutional concept, superior to legislation. True, the constitution cannot contain an explicit provision recognizing the principle of separation of powers. Nevertheless, the principle of separation of powers is a constitutional principle. Such recognition is required by the purposive interpretation of the constitution. T is principle might not be written in the lines of the constitution, but it is written between the lines. It is implicitly derived from the language of the constitution. It is a natural outgrowth

of the structure of the constitution – which distinguishes between three branches of government and provides them each with a separate Basic Law – and all of its provisions. 28

 A similar approach was adopted by the Constitutional Court of South Africa, which stated:

> I cannot accept that an implicit provision of the Constitution has any less force than an express provision … T e Constitutions of the United States and Australia, like ours, make provision for the separation of powers by vesting the legislative authority in the Legislature, the executive authority in the Executive, and the judicial authority in the Courts. T e doctrine of separation of powers as applied in the United States is based on inferences drawn from the structure and provisions of the Constitution, rather than an express entrenchment of the principle. In this respect, our Constitution is no dif erent … T ere can be no doubt that our Constitution provides for such a separation, and that laws inconsistent with what the Constitution requires in that regard, are invalid. 29

 Another fundamental principle of en missing from the express text of most constitutions is the judiciary's independence (as opposed to the independence of the individual judges). T e Supreme Court of Canada has held, nonetheless, that this basic principle is of a constitutional status. 30 Similarly, the principle of the rule of law rarely appears expressly in most modern constitutions. Still, many democratic constitutions consider this principle to be of constitutional status. 31 And, if this is the case for all those fundamental principles – which derive from the organizing principle of democracy itself – then surely the organizing principle itself, namely democracy, is considered an integral part of the constitution. T is conclusion is supported by the constitutional structure and its separate parts – in particular, those relating to human rights, the right to vote, and the decisionmaking mechanisms of the elected body – which, combined, both constitute the notion of democracy and are af ected by it.

 My assumption, therefore, is that the notion of democracy is a constitutional- operative notion. Is it possible to derive from this notion the concept of proportionality? In order to answer this question in the af rmative, it is not enough to prove that the notion of democracy is of constitutional status. Rather, one must also establish – and this is the second assumption – that the constitutional notion of democracy entails

a vital component of recognizing human rights. T e second assumption will now be examined.

## 3. Second assumption: democracy includes human rights

T e notion of democracy has many meanings. "T ere are many views of democracy – from popular democracy to western democracy; from a formal democracy to substantive democracy; and, within substantive democracy, there are dif erent understandings as to the substance of democracy." 32 One of the key distinctions in that context is that between a formal democracy and a substantive democracy. T e notion of formal democracy focuses on the sovereignty of the people, which is demonstrated mainly through free elections ("representative democracy"), which grant, in turn, the right to both vote and be elected to all, equally. T e notion of substantive democracy emphasizes those special features that make democracy unique, like the principles of separation of powers, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and the recognition of human rights. 33 Every constitution provides the notion of democracy with a meaning that best captures its purpose as appearing in that legal system. Most democratic constitutions today tend to interpret the notion of democracy expansively, in a fashion that entails both the formal and the substantive facets of democracy. T us, for example, the German Constitutional Court has emphasized that the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany is based upon the fundamental concept of free democracy, def ned as follows:

> A regime governed by the rule of law and based on the self-declaration of all members of society in accordance with the majority rule, and on the notions of equality and liberty, which prevent any possibility of either rule by force or of an arbitrary and capricious tyranny. 34

 A similar approach was adopted by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:

<sup>32</sup> HCJ 164/97 Contrem Ltd . v. Ministry of Finance – Custom and VAT Department [1998] IsrSC 52(1) 289, 340 (Zamir, J.). See also R. A. Dahl, On Democracy (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1998 ); T. Roux, "Democracy," in S. Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa , 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 1: "Democracy is a noun permanently in search of a quali-

fying adjective." 33 Regarding democracy's dif erent aspects, see Barak, above note 28, at 23. 34 BVerfGE 5, 585.

T is Bill of Rights is a cornerstone of democracy in South Africa. It enshrines the rights of all people in our country and af rms the democratic values of human dignity, equality, and freedom. 35

### Roux has noted, in that context, that:

 [N]o South African political system claiming to be democratic would be worthy of that name unless it respected the democratic values which the Bill of Rights af rms. 36

 A similar approach was adopted by the Israeli Basic Laws. For example, Article 1(a) of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty reads:

> T e purpose of this Basic Law is to protect human dignity and liberty, in order to establish in a Basic Law the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state.

 Indeed, the link between democracy and human rights is inexorable. 37 T e notion of democracy itself is rich and multi-faceted. We should not view democracy, therefore, from a single point of view. Democracy, rather, is multidimensional. While based on the notion of majority rule, it is made up of additional values – in particular that of human rights. T us, democracy is based on the notion that each individual may enjoy certain rights, and that those rights may not be revoked by the majority despite having the alleged power to do so in accordance with the majority rule. 38

35 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 7(1).

- 36 Roux, above note 32, at 33; R. Dworkin, A Bill of Rights for Britain (London: Chatto & Windus, 1990 ), 35: "True democracy is not just statistical democracy, in which anything a majority or plurality wants is legitimate for that reason, but communal democracy, in which majority decision is legitimate only if it is a majority within a community of equals. T at means not only that everyone must be allowed to participate in politics as an equal, through the vote and through freedom of speech and protest, but that political decisions must treat everyone with equal concern and respect, that each individual person must be guaranteed fundamental civil and political rights no combination of other citizens can take away, no matter how numerous they are or how much they despise his or
- her race or morals or way of life." 37 See Barak, above note 28, at 24; Dworkin, above note 36, at 35; R. Dworkin, Freedom's Law: T e Moral Reading of the American Constitution (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1996 ); L. E. Weinrib, "T e Supreme Court of Canada in the Age of Rights: Constitutional Democracy, the Role of Law and Fundamental Rights under Canada's Constitution," 80 Can. Bar Rev . 699, 701 ( 2001 ); W. Osiatynski, Human Rights and T eir Limits (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 72; V. Ferreres Comella, Constitutional Courts and Democratic Values: A European Perspective (New Haven, CT: Yale University
- Press, 2009 ). 38 See J. P. Muller, "Fundamental Rights in Democracy," 4 Hum. Rts. L. J . 131 ( 1983 ); J. Habermas, Between Facts and Norms: Contributions to a Discourse T eory of Law and Democracy (William Rehg trans., Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1996 ); C. R. Sunstein,

T is link between democracy and human rights exists at the constitutional level, and it manifests itself in the interpretation given to the term "democracy" in various constitutions. T e requirement that democracy be given not only its formal meaning but also its substantive meaning is, therefore, a constitutional requirement. 39

 As we have seen, at times the term "democracy" does not appear explicitly in the constitution. Little should be made of that, as the term is clearly implied by the text and structure of the constitution. 40 What is included in the implied term of democracy? T e principled answer to this question is that the meaning and scope of the implied term of democracy is identical to that of its explicit term. Accordingly, even without an explicit mention of the term we should consider the implied notion of democracy to include both its formal and substantive facets, central to which are human rights.

### 4. T ird assumption: democracy is based on a balance between constitutional rights and the public interest

 Proportionality is derived from the notion of democracy, provided that the term is understood to encompass human rights, and is considered to have a constitutional status. While these are necessary conditions, they are not suf cient. Now, we should demonstrate that the same constitutional rights that form the notion of democracy can also be limited; in other words, that these rights are relative and not absolute. As we have seen, modern constitutional rights doctrines distinguish between the scope of the rights and the extent of their realization. 41 T e constitutional rights are, therefore, relative. T is relativity means that a constitutional license to limit those rights is granted where such a limitation may be justif ed to protect the public interest or the rights of others. When the constitutional rights are relative, both the right and the license to limit it are found in the constitution.

T is phenomenon – of both the right and its limitation in the constitution – exemplif es the inherent tension between democracy's two fundamental elements. On the one hand is the right's element, which constitutes

Designing Democracy: What Constitutions Do (Oxford University Press, 2002 ); Van der Schyf , Limitation of Rights: A Study of the European Convention and the South African

Bill of Rights (Nijmegen, T e Netherlands: Wolf Legal Publishers, 2005), 143. 39 See CA 6821/93 United Mizrahi Bank Ltd . v. Migdal Cooperative Village [1995] IsrLR 1, 228. 40 See above at 214. 41 See above at 19.

a fundamental component of substantive democracy. On the other hand is the people element, limiting those very rights through their representatives; these, too, constitute a fundamental component of the notion of democracy, though this time in its formal aspect. How can this tension be resolved? T e answer is that this tension is not resolved by eliminating the "losing" facet from the constitution. Rather, the tension is resolved by way of a proper balancing of the competing principles. T is is one of the expressions of the multi-faceted nature of democracy. Indeed, the inherent tension between democracy's dif erent facets is a "constructive tension." 42 It enables each facet to develop while harmoniously co-existing with the others. T e best way to achieve this peaceful co-existence is through balancing between the competing interests. Such balancing enables each facet to develop alongside the other facets, not in their place. 43

### 5. Fourth assumption: balancing through limitation clauses

T e key concept of the constitutional democracy is balancing – the balancing between the formal and substantive aspects of democracy. 44 Such balancing presupposes the simultaneous co-existence of both aspects, while determining the proper relationship between them. T at balancing ref ects the relative social value of each competing aspect when considered in proper context. When the relevant context is the tension between the formal facet of democracy and constitutional rights, that balancing is resolved through the use of limitation clauses (either general or specif c, express or implied), which determine the required conditions under which a sub-constitutional law may limit a constitutional right. T us, for example, the general limitation clause included in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states:

> T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society. 45

 In interpreting the term "free and democratic society" which appears in the limitation clause, Chief Justice Dickson wrote:

-

<sup>43</sup> On the democratic justif cation for the balance, see S. Gardbaum, "A Democratic Defense of Constitutional Balancing," 4(1) Law and Ethics of Hum. Rts . 77 ( 2010 ). 44 See Barak, above note 28, at 26.

<sup>45</sup> Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Section 1.

### 222 Proportionality: sources, nature, function

 Inclusion of these words as the f nal standard of justif cation for limits on rights and freedoms refers the Court to the very purpose for which the Charter was originally entrenched in the Constitution: Canadian society is to be free and democratic. T e Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society. 46

T ese words by the Chief Justice were taken into account when draf ing the general limitation clause appearing in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa:

> T e rights in the Bill of Rights may be limited only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justif able in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom. 47

In similar vein, the limitation clause of the Israeli Basic Laws reads:

T ere shall be no infringement of rights under this Basic Law except by a law bef tting the values of the State of Israel, enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required. 48

T e "values of the State of Israel," the criteria by which any limitation on constitutional rights established by these Basic Laws is measured, are determined in the "purpose provision" included in these same Basic Laws. 49 According to that provision, these are the values of the State of Israel "as a Jewish and democratic state."

# 6. Fif h assumption: limitation clauses are based on proportionality

 What is the criterion for a proper balance between the two facets of democracy? How can we balance majority rule with human rights? What is the criterion required by a democratic society to limit a constitutional right

by a sub-constitutional law? T e answer to all these questions is that proportionality is a proper criterion. Importantly, this book does not argue that proportionality is the only criterion; my only claim at this point is that proportionality is a proper one. When a law limits a constitutional right, such a limitation is constitutional if it is proportional. 50 It is proportional if it is meant to achieve a proper purpose, if the measures taken to achieve such a purpose are rationally connected to the purpose and are necessary, and if the limiting of the constitutional right is proportional ( stricto sensu ). Each member of society constitutes an integral and equal part of that society. T at society, in turn, is justif ed in limiting the right of each of its members if such a limitation was done for a proper purpose, through proper means, and while limiting the right proportionally – in other words, if the limitation is proportional. Indeed, each person's liberty is an expression of his or her autonomy as part of society. Such integration into society, however, also justif es the imposition of some limitations on this liberty – so long as those are proportional. As Chief Justice Dickson noted in Oakes :

> To establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society, two central criteria must be satisf ed. First, the objective, which the measures, responsible for a limit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to serve, must be "of" suf cient importance to warrant overriding a constitutional protected right or freedom … Second … the party invoking Section 1 must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justif ed. T is involves "a form of proportionality test …" Although the nature of the proportionality test will vary depending on the circumstances, in each case courts will be required to balance the interests of society with those of individuals and groups. T ere are, in my view, three important components of a proportionality test. First the measures adopted must be … rationally connected to the objective. Second, the means … should impair "as little as possible" the right or freedom in question … T ird, there must be a proportionality between the ef ects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective which has been identif ed as of "suf cient importance." T e more severe the deleterious ef ects of a measure, the more important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society. 51

 A similar approach was adopted by the South African Constitutional Court. In Makwanyane , the Court considered a challenge to the

- 50 See Weinrib, above note 37, at 707.
- 51 Oakes , above note 46, at 138.

constitutionality of a death-penalty statute. T e Court held the statute unconstitutional because it was not proportional. As Chief Justice Chaskalson noted:

> T e limitation of constitutional rights for a purpose that is reasonable and necessary in a democratic society involves the weighing up of competing values, and ultimately an assessment based on proportionality … which calls for the balancing of dif erent interests. 52

 Indeed, if a law limits a constitutional right for an improper purpose, or while using irrational means, or unnecessary ones – as others would not impair the right as much – or that the social importance of preventing the harm to the right is greater than the social importance of the benef t to the public interest – when this is the result of the law, the limitation is not justif ed in a democracy.

 In a long series of cases, the Israeli Supreme Court has explained the protection of human rights by way of a democratic justif cation. T is is also the type of reasoning used to justify the Israeli limitation clause. T is was demonstrated in Adalah , a case that examined the constitutionality of a statute restricting family unif cations based on security reasons (twenty-six of the non-Israeli spouses were involved in terrorist activities in Israel). 53 Here, a majority of the Justices were of the opinion that the statute in question, the Law on Citizenship and Entry to Israel (Interim Provisions), 2003, 54 had in fact limited the right to human dignity, which is constitutionally recognized in Israel by Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. In particular, the majority opined that the law limits the right to human dignity of each Israeli spouse prevented from unifying with their non-Israeli spouse living in the Occupied Territories, and that such a limitation was not proportional, and therefore unconstitutional. T is view was based on considerations of democracy. As noted in that case:

> In reviewing the proportionality requirement ( stricto sensu ), we are reminded of the basic tenets on which our constitutional democracy is based, and the human rights enjoyed by all Israelis. T ese basic tenets include the notion that the cause may not always justify the means; that national security is not always paramount; and that the proper purpose of raising the level of national security may not justify a substantial injury

to the lives of thousands of Israelis. One of the main features of our democracy is that it places limits over the ability to limit human rights; that around each member of the society is a wall protecting his or her rights, and that the majority may not penetrate that wall … [In this case,] the added degree of national security obtained by the law in question is achieved through both the elimination of the individual examination and the execution of a total restriction; these lead to an injury so severe to the family life and equality of thousands of Israeli citizens that such measures are disproportional. A democracy does not behave in that manner. A democracy does not impose a total restriction separating its citizens from their spouses, denying them the opportunity to lead a normal family life. A democracy does not impose an absolute restriction presenting its citizens with the option to live without their spouse, or to leave the country in order to lead a normal family life. A democracy does not impose an absolute restriction separating parents from their children. A democracy does not impose a total restriction discriminating between its citizens with regard to their family lives. Indeed, a democracy is required to relinquish the added measure of national security in order to achieve a greater measure – much greater – of equality and the right to family life. T is is how a democracy behaves during times of peace. T is is how it acts during times of terror. It is during these times in particular that the true nature of democracy is revealed … It is during these tough times that Israel is experiencing that its democracy is being tested. 55

### Later on, in that same opinion, it was added:

 Democracy and human rights cannot exist without some risk-taking … Every democratic society is asked to balance between the need to defend the lives and security of its citizens, and the continuing need to protect and defend human rights. T is "balance" does not mean that in order to protect human rights we must take risks that may cause injuries to innocent people. A society wishing to safeguard its democratic values, seeking to continue to keep its democratic nature in times of war and terror, is not entitled to prefer the right to life in any case in which such right conf icts with the protection of human rights. Rather, a democratic society is required to be engaged in the multifaceted task of balancing between the competing values. Such a balance, by its own nature, includes both components of risk and components of probability … Naturally, unreasonable risks should not be taken. A democracy should not commit suicide in order to protect the human rights of its citizens. Democracy, rather, should defend itself and f ght for its own existence and values. But such protection and such combat should be done in a manner that would not deny us our essential democratic nature. 56

<sup>55</sup> See Adalah v. Minister of Interior , above note 53, at para. 93 (Barak, P.). 56 Ibid ., para. 111 (Barak, P.).

T us, proportionality provides a full account of democracy's multifaceted nature. Accordingly, it may be used as a proper criterion for the limitation of constitutional rights.

# 7. An assessment of democracy as a source of proportionality

T e conclusion that proportionality can be derived from the notion of democracy is based on f ve assumptions. All f ve appear legally sound. T e last assumption – that limitation clauses are based upon proportionality – raises two separate questions. First, is proportionality the only way to guarantee the protection of constitutional rights? In other words, are there no other measures, other than proportionality, which guarantee the proper balancing between majority rule (the formal facet of democracy) and human rights (the substantive facet of democracy)? If the answer is that proportionality is the only way to guarantee a proper balance between the dif erent facets of democracy, then a second question arises: What are the components of proportionality, and are all these components necessary to ensure its proper function? T e discussion surrounding these questions will be held during the discussion of the pros and cons of proportionality. 57 For now, it is suf cient to say that, while proportionality is not the only way to realize constitutional rights, it is by far the best way available. T is assertion requires proof – something I attempt to establish in the last part of this book.

# **C. Proportionality and the rule of law**

### 1. T e German approach

 Many in the academic world in Germany – as well as the courts – are of the opinion that the concept of proportionality should be derived from the notion of Rechtsstaat . 58 T is term is commonly translated into English as "the Rule of Law," and into French as "Etat de Droit." 59 All these

terms – which are not identical 60 – are complex. Much has been written about their meaning, 61 but the picture is not yet clear. Here, I focus on the German notion of Rechtsstaat . 62 T is principle is mentioned in the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany with regard to the constitutions of the states ( Länder ) that make up the German Federation ( Bund ). 63 T e principle, however, is not explicitly mentioned with regard to constitutional rights at the federal level. T e prevailing notion is that the principle of the rule of law is implied by the entirety of the Basic Law's provisions, and may also be derived directly from the notion of democracy mentioned explicitly by the Basic Law. 64

T is view – that the rule of law is one of the reasons for considering proportionality as a proper criterion for the constitutionality of

sub-constitutional law that limits constitutional rights – was also adopted by other legal systems. 65 Israel, too, has adopted a similar view. 66

 Is it appropriate to derive the concept of proportionality from the principle of the rule of law? In order to answer this question properly we should conduct a similar examination to the one we held in determining whether proportionality could be derived from the notion of democracy: 67 First, we have to examine whether the rule-of-law principle has a constitutional status. Second, we have to examine whether, as a constitutional principle, the rule of law includes a facet of human rights. T ird, we have to examine whether the rule of law, as a constitutional principle, is based upon a balance between constitutional rights and their limitations. Fourth, we have to determine that such a balance is conducted through the use of limitation clauses (general or specif c, explicit or implicit), which allow for the limitation of a constitutional right through sub-constitutional laws (statute or the common law). Fif h, we have to establish an opinion on whether limitation clauses, which advance the principle of the rule of law, are based on proportionality. T ese f ve questions will now be examined. Due to the similarity between the analysis of the dif erent assumptions regarding the rule of law and the analysis of these same assumptions regarding democracy, an attempt will be made not to repeat things that have already been said.

### 2. First assumption: the rule of law has a constitutional status

T e principle of the rule of law plays a central role in the laws of most modern democracies. However, does it have a constitutional status? T is question has a simple, af rmative answer in those cases where the constitution itself declares that explicitly. T us, for example, the Portuguese Constitution (1976) states explicitly that the Portuguese Republic is a democratic state "based on the rule of law" ( estado de direito ). 68 Similarly, the Spanish Constitution (1978) declares that Spain is a social and democratic state, "subject to the rule of law" ( estado de derecho ). 69 T e

<sup>1, 12. 67</sup> See above, at 213. 68 Constitution of Portugal, Art. 2. 69 Constitution of Spain, Art. 1(1).

Constitution of the Republic of South Africa declares that South Africa is a sovereign and democratic state founded, among others, on the values of "[s]upremacy of the constitution and the rule of law." 70 In those legal systems where the constitution refers explicitly to the rule of law, those provisions are viewed as having a constitutional operative ef ect and not merely of a declaratory nature. 71

 But what is the case when a constitution does not explicitly refer to the rule of law? T e answer to this question varies from one legal system to another and from one court (supreme or constitutional) to the next. T us, for example, the German Constitutional Court has recognized the principle of the rule of law ( Rechtsstaat ) as having constitutional status. T e court arrived at this conclusion af er reading the provisions of the Basic Law as one whole text, 72 while paying particular attention to Germany's democratic nature. 73 Similarly, the Supreme Court of Canada has determined that the principle of the rule of law is a fundamental principle having a constitutional status. 74 T e Supreme Court of India has adopted a similar view, while noting that the rule of law is "clearly a basic and essential feature of the Constitution." 75 In the United States, Tribe has emphasized that the principle of the rule of law, while not explicitly mentioned by the American Constitution, is one of its basic tenets. He writes:

> T e proposition that ours is a government of laws, not men – that we live under the "rule of law" – … is a principle that, by just about any imaginable account, would have to be reckoned part of our Constitution. 76

 Is the rule of law a principle with constitutional status in Israel? T e answer is yes. T e Israeli legal system recognizes several basic constitutional principles which, although not written explicitly into the Basic Laws, are nevertheless written between their lines. One of these principles – alongside the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary – is the principle of the rule of law. 77

### 3. Second assumption: the rule of law includes human rights

 Much like the concept of democracy, 78 the principle of the "rule of law" has several meanings. 79 Its content may change in accordance with the user's tradition. All agree that the principle contains both formal aspects (the "formal rule of law") and jurisprudential aspects (the "jurisprudential rule of law"). Both aspects delineate the principle of legality. According to both aspects, formal and jurisprudential, the "rule of law" is "the law of rules." 80 T is assertion immediately raises the dif cult question of whether Hitler's Germany, or Apartheid South Africa, were legal systems governed by the rule of law. A negative answer to this question requires a more comprehensive understanding of the principle of the rule of law; one that demands, in addition to the formal and jurisprudential aspect, a substantive aspect of the principle. 81 T is is the most controversial part of the rule of law. T ere is no consensus regarding its precise content; but those who agree that the rule of law includes a substantive aspect agree that one of the main tenets of the substantive aspect of the rule of law is the recognition and protection of human rights.

 Such substantive aspects of the rule of law were adopted in Germany af er the Second World War. 82 T e constitutional view accepted in Germany is that the principle of a rule of law state ( Rechtsstaatsprinzip ), derived from the interpretation of the Basic Law, has a strong substantive aspect. 83 Such an approach was adopted by other democracies as well. Principles such as the separation of powers, the judiciary's independence and the right to access the courts (in both public and private matters) are

all considered derivatives of such a substantive rule-of-law principle. 84 T e substantive aspect also includes the notion that the constitutional provisions apply to all state actions. T us, for example, the view that a presidential pardon is an act of personal charity by the president may not be properly squared with the notion of a substantive rule of law. T e granting (or denial) of a pardon are state actions, made by the president, and therefore the relevant constitutional provisions apply. 85 Similarly, any statutes enacted by parliament must comply with the provisions of the constitution; a law in conf ict with the constitution is void, and the courts are authorized to declare it as such. Judicial review on the constitutionality of the statute, therefore, also derives from the substantive aspect of the rule-of-law principle. T e same is true for the non-delegation doctrine, which prevents the legislator from delegating the task of promulgating primary arrangements to the executive branch. 86 Needless to say, the subordination of the executive branch to both the constitution and all the statutes enacted in pursuance thereof may also be derived from the substantive aspect of the rule-of-law principle. T e constitutional basis for judicial review of administrative actions may also be derived from the substantive aspect of the rule of law. Also, if the executive branch violates its obligations under the constitution or under statute, the victims of such violations may be entitled to a remedy even if the executive action was carried out without fault (e.g., without negligence or intent). Finally, and above all, the substantive aspect of the rule of law strives to ensure several justice-related values, primarily the recognition and protection of human rights. 87 As Emiliou has correctly noted:

> Substantive rule of law requires the realization of a just legal order. Above all it subjects state power to substantive, def nite and unamendable constitutional principles and material basic values. T e emphasis of state activity should not be primarily on the establishment of a scheme of formal guarantee of freedom. It should rather be on the attainment, preservation and award of substantive justice within the sphere of the state and those spheres susceptible to state inf uence. T e Grundgesetz does not consider the state as a value in itself. T e state gains its value by securing the liberty of the people. 88

T e rule of law is not merely the law of rules. A similar view was adopted by the Supreme Court of India. 89 T e Court premised the concept of judicial review on a rule of law foundation, and ruled that the rule of law means the rule of liberty. In Israel's legal culture the principle of the rule of law is understood as containing an element of the proper protection of human rights. 90

# 4. T ird assumption: the rule of law is based on a balance between constitutional rights and the public interest

T e substantive aspect of the rule of law – much like the substantive aspect of democracy – is not made up entirely of the protection of constitutional rights. 91 Rather, the rule-of-law principle is a result of a proper balance between all its aspects. It is based, therefore, on a proper balance between constitutional rights and conf icting principles – including the public interest. T is is the prevailing view today across modern constitutional democracies. 92 As Justice Khanna of the Indian Supreme Court has stated:

> Rule of law is now the accepted norm in all civilian societies … Everywhere it is identif ed with the liberty of the individual. It seeks to maintain a balance between the opposing notions of individual liberty and public order. 93

# 5. Fourth assumption: the balancing is conducted through limitation clauses

 Much like the balancing between dif erent aspects of democracy, 94 the balancing between the dif erent aspects of the rule of law is conducted through the use of limitation clauses which determine the constitutionality of rights limitation by sub-constitutional laws. T is result is not

<sup>89</sup> See M. P. Jain, Indian Constitutional Law , 5th edn. (Haryana, India: LexisNexis

surprising, considering the close relationship between democracy and the rule of law. 95 Indeed, the formal and substantive aspects of democracy resemble the formal and substantive aspects of the rule of law. T e main dif erence is in the level of abstraction, as the formal aspect of the rule of law is but one of formal democracy's components, while the substantive aspect of the rule of law is but one of substantive democracy's components.

### 6. Fif h assumption: limitation clauses are based on proportionality

 What should be the content of a limitation clause which properly balances the dif erent aspects of the rule of law? T e answer is that the sub-constitutional law limiting the constitutional right should be proportional. Generally, such an answer is warranted by the dif erent aspects of the rule of law and those of the notion of democracy. If, indeed, proportionality may be derived from democracy, 96 it should also f t the principle of the rule of law. In a more specif c sense, proportionality may be derived directly from the principle of the rule of law. T e rule of law includes, as we have seen, both formal and substantive aspects, in a state of constant tension. T e solution for this tension should be proportional, in that it should recognize both formal and substantive aspects while balancing both proportionally. Such a balance would have to recognize, on the one hand, the need to realize the will of the majority as expressed by the legislative body, and, on the other, the proportional limitations on such power by the majority.

 Such an approach was adopted in Germany by constitutional commentators and the courts. According to this approach, proportionality is derived from the rule of law. 97 As Currie summarizes: "Proportionality is now commonly understood to be one aspect of the Rechtsstaat principle." 98 Such an approach is not limited to constitutional law, but can also be found in Germany's administrative law. 99

### 7. An assessment of rule of law as a source of proportionality

T e remarks made regarding the concept of democracy as a legal source of proportionality 100 surely apply mutatis mutandis to the principle of the rule of law as a legal source of proportionality. Indeed, the close connection between democracy and the rule of law turns that principle into a special source of proportionality. T e authority of proportionality exists due to, as well as is operated by, the very concept of democracy. According to this view, the principle of the rule of law adds nothing to proportionality. Naturally, however, in those legal systems that do not subscribe to the notion of a close connection between democracy (in both its formal and substantive aspects) and the rule of law (both formal and substantive), one should carefully separate considerations of democracy and considerations regarding the rule of law. Further, even if the rule of law serves as a legal source of proportionality, this alone does not mean that proportionality is the only way to realize the rule of law. However, it is the best way available. T is assertion requires proof. T e last part of this book will attempt to supply this proof. 101

# **D. Proportionality asintrinsic to the confict between legal principles**

T e third argument regarding proportionality focuses on the fact that most human rights are legally structured as principles rather than rules. 102 Similarly, the legal structure of many of the considerations justifying limitations on those rights – such as the public interest and the rights of others – is also that of principles. We are facing, therefore, a state

 above note 82, at 41: "T e underlying paradox of democracy based on the rule of law is that freedom requires the observance of certain rules; rules, however, threaten liberty. Ironically the state's very attempt to maximize freedom can result in the opposite ef ect of minimizing the freedom of the citizen. T e answer of the liberal rule of law to this problem is to leave to the individual as much liberty as possible, guaranteed by basic rights, democratic participation and separation of state function. T e principle of proportionality, which constitutes a substantive element of the rule of law has an important role to play in this context. Nobody should unduly restrict basic human rights; one should interfere with individual rights only if, and to the extent that it is, strictly necessary to satisfy a compelling public interest. Limits on individual freedom demand justif cation in terms of either community or individual values meriting legal protection ( Rechtsgüter )." See also Grote, above note 59, at 290: "T e Constitutional Court has explicitly linked the principle of proportionality to the

concept of ' Rechtsstaat '". 100 See above, at 226. 101 See below, at 457. 102 See above, at 38.

of conf ict between several constitutional principles. As previously mentioned, the solution to such a conf ict is not through the declaration of one principle as the "victor," while excluding the other from the constitutional framework. 103 Rather, the solution lies in the proper balancing between the conf icting principles. Such balancing is the very foundation of the rules of proportionality. When the conf icting principles are of constitutional status, the concept of proportionality – which balances them – is of constitutional status as well.

T is argument was made by Alexy, the most astute thinker in this f eld. 104 Alexy begins with the following premise:

> [P]rinciples are norms which require that something be realized to the greatest extent possible given the legal and factual possibilities. Principles are optimization requirements, characterized by the fact that they can be satisf ed to varying degrees, and that the appropriate degree of satisfaction depends not only on what is factually possible but also on what is legally possible. 105

 Def ning principles as such, Alexy next arrives at the conclusion that a conf ict between principles – as opposed to a conf ict between rules – requires the balancing of these conf icting principles. Such balancing is conducted based on the relative "weight" of these principles at the precise point of conf ict.

 How is balancing conducted at the precise point of conf ict between principles? According to Alexy, it is conducted based on the rules of proportionality. T is is not surprising, considering Alexy's view on the relationship between principles in general and the principle of proportionality:

> [T]here is a connection between the theory of principles and the principle of proportionality. T is connection is as close as it could possibly be. T e nature of principles implies the principle of proportionality and vice versa. 106

<sup>103</sup> See above, at 87. 104 See R. Alexy, "Individual Rights and Collective Goods," in C. Nino (ed.), Rights (New York University Press, 1992), 163; R. Alexy, "On the Structure of Legal Principles," 13 Ratio Juris 294 ( 2000 ); R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]); R. Alexy, "Constitutional Rights Balancing and

Rationality," 16 Ratio Juris 131 ( 2003 ). 105 See Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights , above note 104, at 47. See also above, at 87. 106 See Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights , above note 104, at 66.

 According to Alexy, each of the three components of proportionality (rational connection, necessary means, and proportionality stricto sensu ) is essential to an understanding of the constitutional principle, and, therefore, to the solution of the conf ict between the several principles.

 Alexy def nes a principle as a legal norm requiring that some goal be realized to the greatest extent possible given the legal and factual possibilities. T e taking into account of these "legal and factual possibilities" – which constitutes a part of the def nition of the principle itself – ref ects the notion of proportionality. T us, taking into account the factual circumstances – which, again, are part of the def nition itself – is ref ected by the components of rational connection and of necessity. T e rational connection component is required because, without a rational connection, the means used to achieve the proper purpose would have to be lef out of the equation. T e necessity component is required because, if we could use a means that would limit the right less, we should choose it over the one of ered. In that way, other principles would be less limited. T e legal possibilities are weighed by proportionality stricto sensu , which conducts the balance between the conf icting principles. As Alexy puts it:

> T e principle of proportionality in its narrow sense, that is, the requirement of balancing, derives from its relation to the legally possible. If a constitutional rights norm which is a principle competes with another principle, then the legal possibilities for realizing that norm depend on the competing principle. To reach a decision, one needs to engage in a balancing exercise as required by the Law of Competing Principles. Since the application of valid principles, if indeed they are applicable, is required, and since their application in a case of competing principles requires a balancing exercise, the character of the constitutional rights norms as principles implies that when they compete with other principles, a balancing exercise becomes necessary. But this means that the principle of proportionality in its narrow sense can be deduced from the character of constitutional rights norms as principles. 107

 Alexy's approach to the concept of proportionality begins from his definition of the notion of principle. A separate def nition of the principle is likely to lead to a dif erent conclusion relating to proportionality. 108 According to my approach, 109 a principle is made up of fundamental values. T ese values ref ect ideals seeking their maximum realization.

<sup>107</sup> Ibid ., at 67. 108 See K. M ö ller, "Balancing and the Structure of Constitutional Rights," 3 Int'l J. Const. L . 453 ( 2007 ). 109 See above, at 40.

T ey may not be realized. When one principle conf icts with another (for example, when freedom of expression conf icts with public order, or with one's right to enjoy a good reputation) a balance should be struck between the two. According to this approach, the act of balancing does not constitute a part of the def nition of the notion of principle, but rather contains an external activity. Despite this, Alexy's approach is acceptable to the extent that he argues that a conf ict between principles may explain the concept of proportionality. Indeed, our legal universe is full of conf icting principles, and nothing could be more natural than the constant search for the proper criterion to resolve those conf icts. Such criterion would be the product of the constant struggle, or conf ict, between the dif erent legal principles. Unlike Alexy, however, I do not see proportionality as part of the def nition of the notion of a legal principle. Furthermore, I do not share the opinion that proportionality is the only way to resolve the conf ict between legal principles. 110 Unlike Alexy, I am not of the opinion that proportionality af ects the scope of the constitutional right. 111 Proportionality is aimed only at determining the constitutionality of the sub-constitutional law, namely, the realization of the right – not its scope. Common to this approach is Alexy's approach that proportionality is a key criterion in solving the constant conf icts between legal principles.

 Unlike Alexy's approach, the one presented herein does not stem from a def nition of a principle, and therefore does not af ect the principle's scope but merely its realization, or the extent of the right's protection. In fact, as previously suggested, this approach recognizes that proportionality is not the only way to determine the extent of that protection; there are other ways to do so. 112 Accordingly, it is my task – my burden – to prove that proportionality is the best criterion to solve a conf ict between constitutional principles – a conf ict which is realized at the sub-constitutional level. T is book will attempt to do so during the discussion in the last part of the book, in the part dedicated to an assessment of proportionality. 113

 A special issue arises as to those constitutional rights that are constructed as rules. T e explanation of ered for principles does not apply here. However, the concept of proportionality should apply even in those cases where the right is constructed as a rule and is limited by a sub-constitutional law. 114 T e justif cation and the basis for that view do not arise from principle theory, but from one of the other explanations of ered

earlier on, particularly the one dealing with the relation between proportionality and interpretation. T is explanation will now be examined.

# **E. Proportionality and interpretation**

 Democracy, the rule of law, and principle theory are not the only possible sources upon which to establish proportionality. Another source is the constitution itself and its interpretation. 115 T is view has been adopted by several legal systems, including Germany, Canada, Spain, and Israel.

 Constitutional interpretation approaches the text generously. 116 It aspires to achieve constitutional harmony. It adopts a holistic view of the constitution. T e dif erent parts of the constitution are deemed interconnected. 117 Together, they establish constitutional unity. T is unity is based on fundamental values, and those values inspire the interpretation of the constitutional text. T e fundamental provisions upon which the constitution is based create an objective hierarchy of values. 118 According to this hierarchical order, constitutional rights constitute the objective values upon which the constitution is built. T ese objective values – and the values that limit them – are a central feature of the objective constitutional structure. 119 As the German Constitutional Court noted in Luth :

> T e Basic Law is not a value-neutral document … Its section on basic rights establishes an objective order of values, and this order strongly reinforces the ef ective power of basic rights. 120

T e dif erent values that together constitute the objective constitutional order tend to conf ict with one another. For each principle, it is possible to f nd an opposing principle. T is conf ict's resolution is found not by emphasizing the distinguishing features of each principle, but by forming a synthesis between the dif erent principles and creating internal har-

mony between them. All these may be achieved by using the concept of proportionality. As noted by Hesse:

> T e principle of constitutional unity requires an optimization of conf icting values. T e limitations on these values should be such that each value may achieve its own optimal ef ect. Accordingly, in each concrete case, those limitations must abide by the requirements of proportionality. T us, these limitations should require no more than is necessary to achieve unity between the conf icting values. 121

 Indeed, resolving the conf ict between the dif erent constitutional rights – as well as between them and other competing constitutional values – through the concept of proportionality, helps maintain the unity of the constitution.

 Alexy has opined that constitutional proportionality creates a derivative constitutional rule that narrows, in each specif c case, the constitutional scope of the conf icting principles. 122 Such an approach does not fully maintain the notion of constitutional unity, since the derivative constitutional rule keeps reducing the scope of the conf icting principles. In contrast, my approach – which acknowledges the ef ect of the derivative constitutional rule only at the sub-constitutional level 123 – guarantees both maximum harmony and constitutional unity. T e conf ict between constitutional principles at the constitutional level creates no legal consequences at that level. Instead, the legal consequences occur only at the sub-constitutional level (statute or the common law). 124

T e interpretive approach views proportionality as part of the constitution as a result of the interpretation of the entire constitution as a whole. At times proportionality may be derived directly from the explicit text of the constitution. At other times it may be derived from its implicit text. In both cases, however, we are dealing with a constitutional-level doctrine that stems from the desire to ensure constitutional unity and harmony. 125 T e operative ef ect of proportionality, as mentioned, is not at the constitutional level but only at the sub-constitutional level. T is kind of ef ect may determine the constitutionality of a sub-constitutional law trying to limit a constitutional right.

 What is the relationship between the view presented above and interpretive balancing? 126 T e main dif erence between the two lies in the different roles assigned to constitutional proportionality on the one hand and interpretive balancing on the other. Constitutional proportionality determines the legislative validity or compatibility of a sub-constitutional law (a statute or the common law) that limits a constitutional right. It does so while fully developing the concept of proportionality and its components. Interpretive balance, on the other hand, deals not with the question of validity but with that of meaning. It provides meaning to the text of the legal norm. T e balance it carries out uses, by analogy, only one of the components used by proportionality, that of proportionality stricto sensu . It has no interest in proportionality's other components.

T e interpretive explanation is of considerable weight. However, it does not explain fully why proportionality should be preferred over other criteria that also strive to achieve constitutional unity. T at issue will be discussed in the last part of the book.

# **F. Legalsourcessummary: is proportionality a logical necessity?**

 Democracy, the rule of law, principle theory, and constitutional interpretation are all legal sources from which proportionality may be derived as a constitutional concept. When the conf icting principles are of constitutional status and a question arises as to the legal validity of the limiting sub-constitutional law, each of those four sources – and all four of them combined – can establish the constitutional status of proportionality. 127 T is is of utmost importance, both to the rights involved and for constitutional democracies in general.

 Can those four legal sources of er concrete content to the concept of proportionality? Could proportionality stricto sensu , for example, be derived from any of them? Alexy's answer to this question is in the af rmative. His answer is the by-product of his def nition of the term principle. T is term, according to Alexy, inherently contains the concept of proportionality. I do not share this view. 128 According to my approach, the components of proportionality Alexy discusses are possible but not necessary and therefore the way one legal system understands proportionality may

<sup>126</sup> On interpretive balancing, see above, at 72. 127 See Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights , above note 104, at 69. 128 See above, at 40.

inspire another legal system, but nothing more. Proportionality is not an inherent part of the idea of a principle. It is external to it. When constitutional principles conf ict, the conf ict's resolution is not a part of the principles, but rather it is external to them. T e conf ict is resolved at a sub-constitutional level. T e third part of this book analyzes the dif erent components of proportionality as they are understood across several legal systems. T e fourth part will evaluate the concept of proportionality. According to this approach, proportionality is one possible criterion – but not the only one – for evaluating the limitations of constitutional rights. Still, of all the existing criteria, proportionality is the most appropriate. T is is an assertion that needs to be proved.

# Proper purpose

# **A. Te proper purpose as a component of proportionality**

### 1. T e nature of the proper purpose and its sources

### i. T e nature of the proper purpose

 One of the main characteristics of a constitutional democracy is that legal authorization to limit a constitutional right is not suf cient. Legality 1 does not equal legitimacy. Rather, a constitutional democracy requires, in addition to legality, a justif cation for the limitation on the constitutional right to be valid. In other words, the legitimacy component is required. 2 T is element is made up of the proper purpose and the means to achieve that purpose, which limit the constitutional right in a proper manner. T is chapter discusses the f rst of these – the proper purpose component of proportionality.

T e element of proper purpose ref ects a value-laden component. It ref ects the notion that not every purpose can justify a limitation on a constitutional right. One of the unique features of a constitutional right is that it can be limited only to realize such purposes that can justify a limitation of a constitutional right. 3 T e purposes that justify limitations on human rights are derived from the values on which society is founded. In

Knesset of Israel [2005] IsrSC 59(2) 481, 548 ("T e question of whether the purpose is 'proper' is examined in the context of the limitation of the human right protected by the Basic Law. T e question we should be answering is whether a limitation of a human right can be justif ed by the proper purpose of the legislation in question … Accordingly, legislation limiting human rights satisf es the requirement of 'proper purpose' only if the purpose of such legislation provides suf cient justif cation to the specif c limitation of human rights." (Barak, P.)).

a constitutional democracy, these values are democratic values. 4 Indeed, a proper purpose is one that suits the values of the society in a constitutional democracy.

### ii. T e sources of the proper purpose

T e proper purpose requirement necessitates a constitutional foundation. T is constitutional foundation may be explicit or implicit. 5 Examples of an explicit foundation can be found in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 6 the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 7 and Israel's Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. 8

T e constitutional foundation for the proper purpose requirement can also be implicit in the constitution's provisions. An implicit foundation is constitutionally valid just as an explicit foundation is. 9 Such an implicit foundation is evident from the principles of democracy and the rule of law. From the constitutional notion of democracy and the rule of law, one can deduce both the importance of the need to protect human rights, as well as the importance of the need to limit those same rights in order both to safeguard them and to satisfy the public interest.

### 2. Proper purpose as a threshold requirement

### i. T e reason for threshold requirements

T e proper purpose component examines whether a law (a statute or the common law) that limits a constitutional right is for a purpose that justif es such limitation. 10 T is examination is carried out without considering the scope of the suggested limitation on the constitutional right, the means used to achieve such a purpose, or the relationship between the benef t in achieving that purpose and the harm incurred by the constitutional right. Rather, this is a threshold examination. It focuses on the law's

purpose rather than its consequences. Such an examination seeks to provide an answer to the threshold question of whether, in a constitutional democracy, a constitutional right can be limited to realize the purpose underlying the limiting law. T e examination, therefore, does not conduct any balancing between the benef t to society should the law be allowed to proceed and the harm caused to the right due to that same law. Such balancing is conducted within other components of proportionality.

ii. Hogg's opposing view

 According to Hogg, "a judgment that the ef ects of the law were too severe would surely mean that the objective was not suf ciently important to justify limiting a Charter right." 11 Accordingly, Hogg concludes that the component of proportionality stricto sensu12 is unnecessary, as the balancing between the benef t in realizing the purpose underlying the law and the harm caused to the right in question is carried out within the framework of the f rst component – that of a proper purpose:

> If the objective is suf ciently important, and the objective is pursued by the least drastic means, then it must follow that the ef ects of the law are an acceptable price to pay for the benef t of the law. I conclude, therefore, that an af rmative answer to the f rst step – suf ciently important objective – will always yield an af rmative answer to the fourth step – proportionate ef ect. 13

### iii. A reply to Hogg

 Hogg's view is unacceptable. 14 Nor is it accepted in comparative law. 15 We must dif erentiate between two questions: the f rst, what are the purposes that may justify, in a democracy, a limitation of a constitutional right; the other is whether a law designed to realize such a purpose properly balances between the benef t to society caused by the law and the harm it may cause to the constitutional right. In order to answer the f rst question we should set the proper criteria to examine which purposes would justify a limitation on a human right. T ese purposes are determined by

<sup>11</sup> P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada , 5th edn., vol. II (Toronto: T omson Carswell,

<sup>2007), 153. 12</sup> On proportionality stricto sensu , see below, at 340. 13 Hogg, above note 11.

each society's values, and may vary, within a given society, from one right to another. In order to answer the second question we should determine whether the realization of the purpose underlying the law may justify the amount of harm caused to the constitutional right. Such criteria are determined by the other components of proportionality and those of proportionality stricto sensu in particular. 16

 Contrary to Hogg, the understanding of the proper purpose component as a threshold requirement protects human rights adequately. Such an approach draws a clear line between considerations that can justify limitations on human rights and considerations that cannot. 17 Beyond this line, no considerations should be examined, and the rest of proportionality's components would not be triggered. T is approach may also be derived from considerations of separation of powers. T ose considerations provide, in the present context, the granting of a wide discretion to the legislator in devising the purposes it seeks to realize. 18 When a court determines that a statute is unconstitutional by virtue of a limitation that failed to properly balance between the benef ts caused by realizing the purpose and the harm caused to the right in question by the same legislation, then it would be wrong to assume that the purpose sought by the legislator, in and of itself, is unconstitutional. A court opinion rendering a law unconstitutional does not necessarily mean that the purpose chosen by the legislator is unconstitutional. T at purpose may have been – and thus remains – proper, but such a purpose cannot be realized through the means chosen by the legislator, as these were disproportional with regard to the harm caused to the constitutional right in question. In these kinds of cases, therefore, it is not the purpose's nature giving rise to the constitutional issue, but rather the disproportionality of the means chosen to achieve that purpose. T e lack of proportionality does not turn the purpose into an "improper" one; the conf ict with the constitutional provision is not a matter of purpose but rather of the means chosen to achieve that purpose, means that limit the constitutional right in a disproportional manner.

 Take, for example, a law limiting freedom of expression in order to protect national security. At this stage of the constitutional review, the only question requiring an answer is whether in principle we can – in light

<sup>16</sup> A similar (though not identical) distinction is drawn between the scope of the constitu-

tional right and the extent of its protection. See below, at 340. 17 See R. Pildes, "Dworkin's Two Conceptions of Rights," 29 J. Legal Studies 309 ( 2000 ). 18 See below, at 401.

of the requirement that the law should serve a "proper purpose" – limit one person's right to freedom of expression in order to protect national security interests. A separate question – not considered at this stage – is: what is the scope of the limitation on freedom of expression that the purpose of national security can justify? An answer to this separate question requires a balancing between the benef ts gained by the realization of the security purpose and the harm caused to the right in question. Such balancing, however, should not be conducted prematurely; it should not be carried out within the conf nes of the proper purpose component. Rather, it should be done in the next stages of proportionality, particularly the stage of proportionality stricto sensu . 19 Only at this later stage can we properly estimate the scope of a right's harm, and a balance be struck between that limitation and the benef ts obtained by the limiting law. If at the end of the balancing process the result would be that no justif cation exists for this type of limitation on the right to freedom of expression, the purpose for which the law was enacted may still be "proper." Such a purpose would continue to be "proper" even if no means exist which would enable its complete realization.

 A discussion of the constitutionality of the means while considering the appropriateness of the purpose chosen would be premature, and lack the required factual basis. Rather, we should f rst examine the legality of the law's purpose, while ignoring the means used to achieve that purpose. If there is no proper purpose, the law should be invalidated without further examination. Only af er the law's purpose has been found to be "proper" can we continue to examine whether the means chosen to achieve that purpose are proper as well, and whether the relationship between the benef ts of realizing the purpose and the harm caused to the right in question is proportional. Such an examination is not a part of the discussion of the law's purpose, but only its realization in practice.

# **B. Te elements of proper purpose**

### 1. T e scope of the proper purpose

 An examination of the purpose assumes the limitation of a constitutional right. Accordingly, the criteria used in determining the proper purpose should not be confused with that used for determining the right's scope. Moreover, the examination of the proper purpose does not include an

19 See below, at 340.

examination of the extent of the limitation on the constitutional right. Indeed, the examination of the nature of the purpose is designed to answer the question of whether a constitutional democracy justif es a limitation on a constitutional right to realize that purpose. Here, two extreme views can be excluded:

> On the one hand, we should not deduce a presumption – in particular, a non-refutable presumption – wherein the purpose of each statute produced by the legislator is proper. If this was the accepted view the requirement for a proper purpose would turn into an exercise in futility … But we should also object, on the other hand, to the view that a purpose is proper if and only if it does not limit any human right. T is interpretation, too, turns the search for a proper purpose into an exercise in futility; the precise object of the examination is to determine which limitations on human rights are proper and which are not. An ex ante assumption that every limitation is not proper contradicts, therefore, the very essence of the search for a proper purpose, and therefore should not be adopted. 20

 Indeed, the issue in question is not whether a constitutional right can be limited. It is agreed upon that most rights are relative in nature and therefore can be limited. 21 Absolute rights are rare, and are only found in a limited number of constitutional rights such as the prohibition on slavery or torture. 22 T e vast majority of constitutional rights are relative; i.e., they can be limited. T e main dif erence between many Western constitutions lies in determining the exact protection granted to each of these constitutional rights. As far as the proper purpose component is concerned, the dif erence lies in determining which legal scenarios should be included within the "proper purposes" that may justify the limitation of a human right.

T e discrepancy between the constitutions may be overstated. In fact, it is agreed upon that a limitation on one constitutional right may be justif ed – or, in other words, is for a "proper purpose" – if it was done in order to protect another constitutional right held by another. 23 Similarly, it is agreed upon that a right can be limited in order to prevent a national

calamity or social disaster. 24 Disagreement exists as to the precise probability by which such events should occur in order to justify the limitation, as well as to the scope of the protection to be granted to the public interest beyond these obvious examples.

# 2. T e components of the proper purpose

T e question of when the purpose of a law limiting a constitutional right is considered "proper" requires the examination of two related issues. 25 First, we should examine the types of purpose that can justify limitations imposed on constitutional rights. Second, we should examine the degree of urgency required in realizing those proper purposes. T e f rst issue is related to the very nature of the purposes purporting to limit a constitutional right. It is meant to determine those purposes that constitute the constitutional minimum below which no limiting law can exist. T e second issue relates not to the nature of the purpose but rather to its degree of urgency. Without such a determination, no limiting law can exist in a constitutional democracy. Each issue will now be reviewed separately.

# **C. Te proper purpose's content and the state's democratic values**

# 1. Democracy's minimum requirements

T e proper purpose of a law limiting a constitutional right is derived from the democratic values of the state; these values can be found (either explicitly or implicitly 26 ) in the constitution. From this determination we can conclude that a purpose conf icting with these constitutional provisions could not be considered "proper" for purposes of constitutional review. 27 T us, a law whose only purpose is to discriminate is not for a proper purpose. 28 But what are those democratic values for which realization constitutes a proper purpose – despite placing limitations on the constitutional right?

 Given the dif erences between the legal systems, it is no easy task to determine the democratic nature of each separately. However, since we are only dealing with the narrow issue of determining the constitutional minimum required in limiting human rights, there are many shared characteristics between the legal systems. As we have already seen, 29 the following two assumptions are shared by most Western legal systems. 30 First, it is essential for every constitutional democracy that the people be the ultimate sovereign. 31 T is sovereignty is translated into practice through the conduct of free and equal elections, where the people elect those representatives who best ref ect their opinions. Viewed in this way, a democracy can be identif ed with the notions of majority rule and the centrality of the legislative body, where the representatives of that majority operate. T is is the formal aspect of democracy. It is of considerable importance. Without it, neither the regime nor the society can be seen as having a true democratic nature. T e second assumption is that a democracy must recognize several principles, including separation of powers, 32 the rule of law (including the formal, jurisprudential, and substantive meaning of the term), 33 independence of the judiciary (both personal and institutional), 34 human rights, and other basic values allowing for the coexistence of dif erent groups within a single democratic society. T is is the substantive aspect of democracy, and it is of major importance. Without it, there is no democracy.

 Democracy is a multi-faceted, complex phenomenon. 35 It should not be viewed as one-dimensional. Democracy is based, on the one hand, on the fundamental notion of the people – as represented by its elected representatives – and, on the other hand, on the notion of democratic values, including human rights as well as moral and social values. 36 Democracy has its own internal morality, without which the regime no longer remains democratic. 37 As I wrote in one case:

- (1998). 37 See R. Dworkin, A Bill of Rights for Britain (London: Chatto & Windus, 1990 ), 35; R. Dworkin, Is Democracy Possible Here: Principles for A New Political Debate (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 131.

<sup>29</sup> See above, at 218.

<sup>30</sup> See A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 23. 31 Ibid . 32 Regarding the separation of powers, see below, at 385.

 Democracy is not merely majority rule. Democracy is also the rule of fundamental values and human rights as expressed by the constitution. Democracy is a delicate balance between majority rule and fundamental values that control that majority. Democracy is not only "formal democracy" (which is primarily concerned with the election process of the representative institutions guaranteeing the majority rule). Democracy is also "substantive democracy" (which is primarily concerned with the protection of human rights) … Remove majority rule from a constitutional democracy, and you have of ended its very nature. Take fundamental-value rule away from a constitutional democracy, and you have of ended its very existence. 38

 Democracy is premised, therefore, on the co-existence of both majority rule and the rule of democratic values. 39 Not every infringement on these aspects, however, necessarily renders the government non-democratic. Rather, we are dealing with a spectrum of factual circumstances, ranging from selective compliance with only those values that guarantee a minimal function of democracy, all the way to complete adherence to all democratic values. A state of "minimal democratic existence," therefore, is found at one end of the spectrum. T is is the minimum threshold below which neither the society nor its government can claim to be democratic.

### 2. Pertinent democratic values

### i. T e protection of constitutional rights and the realization of the public interest

 Of the many values underlying democracy, the most pertinent to the proper purpose component are constitutional rights on the one hand, 40 and the public interest (or the public good) on the other. 41 Constitutional rights are the rights embodied (expressly or impliedly) in the constitution vis-à-vis the state. In some instances, the constitution establishes the operation of these rights vis-à-vis other persons as well, in addition to their application to the state. 42 But these instances are rare. Most constitutions establish the individual's constitutional rights vis-à-vis the state and not vis-à-vis other individuals. It is generally agreed upon that the application of human rights vis-à-vis others is indirect rather than

<sup>38</sup> See CA 6821/93 United Mizrahi Bank Ltd . v. Migdal Cooperative Village [1995] IsrLR 1. 39 See Barak, above note 30, at 23.

<sup>40</sup> See above, at 218. 41 See above, at 218. 42 See, e.g., the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 8(2).

direct. 43 T ose rights are aimed at the state authorities; who, in turn, when determining the laws which apply between individuals ("private law") should refrain from limiting the constitutional rights the individual has vis-à-vis them (negative rights) and should protect the individuals vis-à-vis the state (positive rights). 44 T is determination of the law ("private law") is made through legislation, its interpretation, the f lling of legislative gaps, and common law development. 45

T e public interest (or the public good) is the sum total of interests that do not constitute only constitutional rights. Considerations of public interest include the continued existence of the state, national security, public order, tolerance, protection of a person's feelings, and other interests that do not constitute constitutional rights. T ey are derived from – either explicitly or implicitly – the constitution itself. 46 One of democracy's unique features is that not every public interest consideration may justify a limitation on human rights – or, in other words, constitute a "proper purpose."

T e distinction between a constitutional right and the public interest is far from trivial. An issue worth examining is at what point does a public interest – meant to protect the public – turn into a constitutional right. Take, for example, the public interest of national security, which includes the interest in the physical and mental well-being of the people of the state. Can this interest be "translated" into a constitutional right held by each resident of the state vis-à-vis the state to have their body and mind protected at all times? Does an individual have a right vis-à-vis the state for peace and security? T e answer to this question is far from trivial; it may become even more complicated in those instances where a legal system recognizes a duty of the state to positively protect those rights. 47 How can we distinguish between the state's duty to protect human rights and its authority to guarantee the public interest? Take, for example, the right to life. T e right of every person in a mature constitutional democracy is that the state should not limit their right to life. 48 Similarly, in every mature constitutional democracy the individual has the right that the state would protect their life. 49 Can we then conclude, from these two assumptions, that every person in a mature constitutional democracy

<sup>43</sup> See above, at 85. 44 See below, at 422. 45 See A. Barak, "Constitutional Human Rights and Private Law," in D. Friedmann and D. Barak-Erez (eds.), Human Rights in Private Law (Portland, OR: Hart Publishing, 2001 ), 13. 46 See above, at 53. 47 See below, at 422. 48 Art. 2 of Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, above note 8.

<sup>49</sup> Art. 4 of Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, above note 8.

may have a right – vis-à-vis the state – to have his or her life protected through the war on terror, crime-f ghting, or the enforcement of safe driving practices?

T e distinction between protection of constitutional rights and public interest is of particular importance within the concept of proportionality in general, and the component of proper purpose in particular. T e protection of a constitutional right, in and of itself, constitutes a "proper purpose." In contrast, not every interest included within the "public interest" may pass the threshold required to become a proper purpose. 50

### ii. Protection of human rights

T e protection of human rights is pertinent to the proper purpose for two reasons. First, the constitutional right itself is the object of limitation; second, the right is also an element of the proper purpose. T is chapter focuses on the second reason. Indeed, it is accepted that, in a constitutional democracy, one such purpose, deemed proper in the context of limiting human rights, is the purpose of protecting human rights. A society seeking to protect one person's free will must also protect the free will of another person with opposite views. T e legal system's recognition of both of their free wills requires, in turn, the imposing of limitations on both of their rights. T e recognition of the rights of others, therefore, is a "proper purpose" for limiting a constitutional right. T e Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789) expresses the same idea by stating:

> Liberty consists in the freedom to do everything which injures no one else; hence the exercise of the natural rights of each man has no limits except those which assure to the other members of the society the enjoyment of the same rights. T ese limits can only be determined by law. 51

 In a mature constitutional democracy, the state has a double duty. First, it must refrain from limiting constitutional rights. T is is the "negative" aspect ( status negativus ) of the constitutional right. 52 Second, it must maintain and protect the constitutional right. T is is the positive aspect ( status positivus ) of the constitutional right. 53 Both of these aspects are within the purview of the state's duty. As the Constitution of the Republic of South

<sup>50</sup> See below, at 265.

<sup>51</sup> Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, § 4 (1789).

<sup>52</sup> See Barak, above note 30, at 217.

<sup>53</sup> See D. P. Currie, "Positive and Negative Constitutional Rights," 53 U. Chi. L. Rev . 864 ( 1986 ); A. Mowbray, T e Development of Positive Obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights (Portland, OR:

Africa points out: "T e state must respect, protect, promote and fulf ll the rights in the Bill of Rights." 54 T us, the state has a constitutional duty to protect human rights. But the state cannot fulf ll that duty without limiting human rights. From here we may deduce the constitutional license to limit constitutional rights to protect the rights of others. T erefore, the fulf llment of the constitutional obligation to protect human rights is a proper purpose.

### iii. T e public interest

 Democracy consists not only of notions such as the people's sovereignty, separation of powers, the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary, and human rights. Rather, democracy also entails the realization of the fundamental principles essential to the shared existence of the people in a democracy. All these values, combined, represent the normative universe of democracy. 55 T ey draw their very existence from the culture of each society, from its history to its raison d'être . T erefore, the notion of "minimal democratic experience" must include several categories of worthy, or proper purposes, such as the continued existence of the state, the continued existence of its democratic nature, its national security and public order. T ese values, necessary to guarantee the continued shared existence of the people in a democracy, together constitute the public interest or the public good. T e precise set of values included on that list is never f xed, and may change from time to time and from one constitutional society to another.

T e scope of the public interest, and the categories which characterize it, are the main problems of the notion of proper purpose. In a constitutional democracy, not every value included in the public interest qualif es as a proper purpose for the limitation of a human right. 56 Doubts surround the scope of the category of the public interest. Too narrow an approach regarding the public interest may af ect the existence of a democracy and its ability to protect human rights. Too wide an approach

See also Kumm, above note 10.

may cause harm to human rights and to the notion of democracy itself. T erefore, it is important to establish general standards in the determination of the nature of the public interest. Additionally, it is important to determine the categories and sub-categories which realize it.

# 3. General criteria for determining the proper purpose

# i. Comparative law

T e criteria for determining the content of the proper purpose varies from one legal system to another. In some cases, the constitution itself may contain express provisions as to the content of the criteria. T us, for example, the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa contains a general limitation clause, which states that the limitation on human rights should be "reasonable and justif able in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom." 57 Naturally, such an intricate provision has raised some serious interpretive issues. As Woolman and Botha noted:

> Determining the meaning of this phrase is fraught with interpretive dif culties as old as political theory itself. T ere are, for starters, the tensions between democracy and rights, between equality and freedom, and the deeply contested nature of each of these terms. 58

 Woolman and Botha also provide some background to the criterion adopted by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa for determining a proper purpose. T ey explain that the South African provision does not adopt many of the limitations used by other constitutions, such as national security, public interest, or public order. T is omission was intentional, they explain; it ref ects the accumulated experience of the Apartheid regime, during which opposition was suppressed on the basis of precisely those considerations which are now omitted from the Constitution. Instead, the Constitution has now chosen to refer in its general limitation clause to those fundamental values at the basis of every open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality, and liberty. As such, the legal system was forced to develop a substantive notion of the fundamental values adopted by the constitutional framework. T is approach requires the harmonization of the dif erent constitutional values

57 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Art. 36(1).

- 58 Woolman and Botha, above note 25, at 113.
and the relationships between them. As Justice Sachs of the Constitutional Court of South Africa stated:

> [L]imitation analysis under Section 36 is antithetical to extreme positions which end up setting the irresistible force of democracy and general law enforcement, against the immovable object of constitutionalism and protection of fundamental rights. What it requires is the maximum harmonization of all the competing considerations, on a principled yet nuanced and f exible case-by-case basis, located in South African reality yet guided by international experience, articulated with appropriate candour and accomplished without losing sight of the ultimate values highlighted by our Constitution. 59

 Of en, the constitution provides a general statement that the limitations must be justif ed by the democratic nature of society. T us, for example, Section 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires limitations on constitutional rights to be "demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society." 60 In interpreting this provision, Chief Justice Dickson wrote:

> T e Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society. T e underlying values and principles of a free and democratic society are the genesis of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter and the ultimate standard against which a limit on a right or freedom must be shown, despite its ef ect to be reasonable and demonstrably justif ed. 61

 A number of additional constitutions determine that the limitations be "necessary" in a democratic society. 62

ii. General criteria: Israeli law

T e Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty contains a specif c provision dedicated to "basic principles":

> Fundamental human rights in Israel are founded upon recognition of the value of the human being, the sanctity of human life, and the principle

<sup>59</sup> Prince v. President of the Law Society of the Cape of Good Hope , 2002 (2) SA 794, § 155. 60 Section 1 of the Canadian Charter, above note 6.

<sup>61</sup> R . v. Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103, § 64. 62 See the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, November 4, 1950, 213 UNTS 222, Arts. 8–11, which determine, among others, that the

that all persons are free; these rights shall be upheld in the spirit of the principles set forth in the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel. 63

T is provision, coupled with the Basic Law requirement that every law limiting constitutional rights must be in congruence with "the values of the State of Israel," 64 assisted the Israeli Supreme Court in determining the general criterion for the proper purpose. T e issue was raised in the United Mizrahi Bank case. 65 President Shamgar described the nature of the proper purpose as follows:

> A positive purpose from the point of view of human rights and society's values, including that of establishing a reasonable and fair balance between the rights of dif erent people with inconsistent interests. A proper purpose is one that creates a foundation for living together, even if it entails a compromise in the area of granting optimal rights to each and every individual, or if it serves interests that are essential to the preservation of the state and society. 66

In my own opinion in that case I wrote:

T e purpose is proper if it is intended to fulf ll important social goals for the fulf llment of a social framework that recognizes the constitutional importance of human rights and the need to protect them. 67

T e Israeli Supreme Court adopted this approach in a long line of cases. T us, for example, the Court ruled that a law's purpose would be recognized as proper if it demonstrates sensitivity to the notion of human rights within the overall social scheme. It was also noted by the Court that a purpose is proper if it was meant to create a foundation for the shared experience of individuals that is a part of the democratic experience, and to create a social framework to protect and advance human rights. 68

limitation of the human rights discussed in these articles needs to be necessary. All of the Convention's member states use the same wording. See R. C. A. White and C. Ovey, Jacobs, White and Ovey: T e European Convention on Human Rights , 5th edn. (Oxford

### 4. T e categories of proper purposes

- i. Specif c purposes appearing in general and specif c limitation clauses
**a. Specifed purposes in general limitation clauses** A general criterion for determining the notion of a proper purpose within a legal system must provide, with some degree of specif city, a number of categories (and sub-categories) that together constitute the proper purpose general criterion. Such specif cation may be useful on two levels. First, it determines those purposes that justify the limitation of human rights (positive determination). T at, in turn, would reduce the friction and disagreements around that issue in any given legal system. Second, that degree of specif city may also inform us – through interpretation – which purposes should be excluded from consideration as being "proper" (negative determination). T e list of the dif erent categories, however, should never be closed. T ese categories change over time, according to the changes that the hosting democratic society is undergoing.

T e most important example of categories and sub-categories of the types of purposes deemed "proper" appear in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 69 T e Declaration's general limitation clause provides:

> In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society. 70

T is provision has inspired – and served as a model for – several international treaties as well as several constitutions. 71

 General limitation clauses specifying special purposes appear in several constitutions. T us, for example, the Constitution of Poland (1997) contains a general limitation clause that specif es a list of proper purposes:

> Any limitation upon the exercise of constitutional freedoms and rights may be imposed only by statute, and only when necessary in a democratic state for the protection of its security or public order, or to protect

- 69 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).
<sup>70</sup> Ibid ., Art. 29(2). 71 See, e.g., International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, opened for signature December 19, 1966, 993 UNTS 3 (entered into force March 23, 1976); American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man (1948); P. Sieghart, T e International Law of Human Rights (Oxford University Press, 1983 ), 85.

the natural environment, health or public morals, or the freedoms and rights of other persons. Such limitations shall not violate the essence of freedoms and rights. 72

 **b. Explicit purposes in specifc limitation clauses** Most constitutions and treaties on human rights contain, along with the rights themselves, specif c limitation clauses. T ose limitation clauses are unique in that they specify those specif c categories (and sub-categories) in which, for their fulf llment, constitutional rights may be limited. T e European Convention on Human Rights is a good example. 73 T e Convention contains no general limitation clause; however, some of the rights specif ed in the document are accompanied by specif c limitation clauses. T ese specif c limitation clauses list the purposes that may justify the limitation of specif c rights recognized by the Convention. T us, for example, Article 8(1) recognizes the right of any person to have "respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence." Article 8(2) specif es the instances in which such rights may be limited; this is when the limitation:

> [i]s necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.

 Similar purposes appear alongside the rights to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 9); the right to freedom of expression (Article 10); and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to the freedom of association with others (Article 11). T e prevailing view with regard to these provisions is that the list of express purposes therein is exhaustive, and no other implied purposes should be deduced or added to the list. 74 T is is an interpretive conclusion. Each legal system may come to its own conclusions as to those specif c limitation clauses in its constitutional interpretation process.

### ii. Implicit purposes

 At times the constitution contains no specif c provisions regarding the category of proper purposes. T is does not indicate that these constitutional rights are absolute. T e constitution's silence should not be

- 73 European Convention on Human Rights, above, at 62.
- 74 White and Ovey, above note 62, at 309.

<sup>72</sup> Constitution of the Republic of Poland, Art. 31(3).

interpreted, in these instances, as a negative solution. 75 Rather, in most of these instances, the dif erent categories of purposes may be implicitly derived from the constitutional text, and particularly from the provisions relating to the democratic nature of the state. 76 In some cases, a constitution may include several rights accompanied by explicit provisions relating to the type of cases in which their limitation would be justif ed, while several other rights included in the same constitution do not contain any such provisions. Here, too, the constitutional silence should not be interpreted as a negative solution. Finally, the implicit categories of proper purposes may vary from one legal system to another, and – over time – may change within a single legal system.

### iii. Protection of the rights of others

**a. Explicit provisions** T e agreed-upon approach is that the protection of the rights of others is a purpose that is "proper" – that is, a purpose that justif es the limitation of a constitutional right. 77 A specif c provision to that ef ect appears, in some cases, in the general limitation clause itself. Such is the case, for example, with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). 78 Article 29(2) of the Declaration states that the rights enumerated therein may only be limited, inter alia , "for purposes of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others."

T at same purpose may appear in specif c limitation clauses. T us, for example, the limitation clauses found in the rights appearing in Articles 8, 9, 10, and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights 79 all state explicitly that the rights stated therein – the right to respect for a person's private and family life, his home and his correspondence (Article 8), the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion (Article 9), the right to freedom of expression (Article 10), and the rights of freedom of assembly and association (Article 11) – may be limited, inter alia , for "the protection of the rights and freedoms of others."

 **b. Implied provisions** T e constitution's silence regarding the protection of the rights of others as a proper purpose should not be interpreted

<sup>75</sup> See Sieghart, above note 71, at 103. See also above, at 56.

<sup>76</sup> See R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (Julian Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]), 82. 77 See above, at 254; Van der Schyf , above note 2, at 151. 78 Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

<sup>79</sup> European Convention on Human Rights, above, at 62.

as a negative solution. 80 Without an explicit provision, the notion that constitutional rights may be limited to protect the rights of others should be deduced from the principled criteria and mainly from the democratic nature of the constitution. T is justif cation is the easiest to defend. Indeed, he who wants to protect human rights must be prepared to limit those same rights. When human rights conf ict, the right way to resolve such a conf ict is not by narrowing the scope of the rights themselves (at the constitutional level) but by recognizing the possibility of limiting them at the sub-constitutional level, 81 when the justif cation for so doing is to protect the constitutional right of another.

**c. Te scope of the category** T e scope of the category regarding "the rights of others" is far from clear. One of the reasons for this is that the precise location of the line dividing a person's right from a person's interest is hard to prescribe accurately. In any event, what is clear is that the category regarding the limitation of a constitutional right in order to protect the rights of others includes all the other rights included in the constitution itself. T e constitution grants individuals several rights visà-vis the state. 82 T e state's duty towards that person may conf ict with its duty towards others. 83 T us, for example, the state's duty to protect one person's constitutional right 84 (such as privacy) may conf ict with its duty not to limit another's constitutional right (such as freedom of expression). T is conf ict, as we have seen, occurs only at the sub-constitutional level. 85 According to this approach, a private-law statutory provision regulating individual rights – that is, granting certain rights to one person while limiting the rights of another – may f nd its constitutional justif cation in the protection it extends to the rights of others. Legislation in the f elds of contracts, torts, and property, while taking from one, provides the same measure to another. While doing so, the state simultaneously limits one person's rights vis-à-vis the state while simultaneously fulf lling its duty to protect the rights of others vis-à-vis the state.

 Should that consideration be limited only to a conf ict between constitutional rights? What is the case, for example, with a law limiting a constitutional right in order to protect a right not included in the constitution?

- 80 For a negative solution, see above, note 19, at 68.
- 81 See above, at 89.
- 82 See above, at 85.
- 83 See above, at 85.
- 84 For the notion of positive rights, see below, at 422.
- 85 See above, at 89.

T e answer is that the consideration regarding the protection of the rights of others is not limited to the protection of constitutional rights. 86 Rather, it applies to the protection of every right, whether it is included in the constitution or in a sub-constitutional law (such as a statute or the common law), and whether it was recognized when the constitution was ratif ed or at a later date. T e justif cation for such an approach cannot rest with the special argument relating to the state's constitutional duty to protect the constitutional rights in conf ict; but rather, with the more general notion of the criterion for proper purpose. Such criterion seeks "to take rights seriously." T is "seriousness" is not limited to constitutional rights. T e need to be sensitive to the vital role human rights play within the general social framework does not limit itself to constitutional rights alone; it also includes the notion that the protection of non-constitutional rights may justify the limitation of other rights, including constitutional rights. Indeed, a democracy seeks to protect not only those rights found in the constitution, but also those that remain outside that document. All human rights are precious to a democracy, regardless of their legal status. T e constitutional recognition of some rights should not be interpreted as a negative solution for the legal system's recognition – at the sub-constitutional level – of the non-constitutional rights. 87 Such continued recognition justif es this consideration in the framework of the limitation of the constitutional right. 88 T at said, the relative weight granted by the legal system to a non-constitutional right is dif erent from the one provided to a constitutional right. T is is particularly true in terms of the means taken to realize those rights, and the proper relationship – or proportionality – required between the potential benef ts of those rights and the harm to the constitutional right in question. T ese matters, however, need not be considered during the discussion of the question of the proper purpose's threshold. T ey should not af ect the recognition of the protection of a non-constitutional right as a possible justif cation for the limitation of a constitutional right.

 In general, the scope of the category of the protection of the rights of others is immense. 89 Of en it overlaps with other categories. Due to its wide application, some refer to it as a "catch-all" category. 90 T us, for

example, the South African Constitutional Court examined a case where the petitioner claimed that his right to health was limited as he could not be connected to a dialysis machine (due to the shortage of such machines at the time). T e court agreed that his right was limited; but was also of the opinion that this limitation was justif ed. T is justif cation, the court explained, rested in part on the right of others to health. 91T e same is true in Israel, where the Supreme Court has recognized a possible limitation to the right to freedom of expression by allowing the consideration of an undue burden on the feelings on others. 92 Such justif cation may also be recognized as part of the more general category of the protection of the rights of others. 93

### iv. Public interest considerations

**a. Te nature of the public interest** I def ne public interest or public good as any consideration justifying a limitation of a constitutional right and which is not included within the category of the protection of the rights of others. 94 T is category is made up of values and principles that society may consider as justif cations for the limitation of a constitutional right. 95 It also demonstrates the notion that constitutional rights are not absolute. 96 While the very existence of this category is not in doubt, the precise details of its content are far from clear. A society striving to protect human rights – a society taking human rights seriously – should not allow every public interest consideration to justify a limitation of a constitutional right. 97 T e benef ts gained by satisfying the public interest (either substantive or procedural 98 ), in and of themselves, are not suf cient to justify a limitation on constitutional rights. Despite that, even a society that takes rights seriously cannot protect human rights at all costs. T e approach of f at lex pereat mundus ("let justice be done, though

the world perish") is not accepted. Even Nozick, the great opponent of state intervention, was willing to recognize the notion of curtailing (or limiting) human rights in times of national disaster. 99 T e same is true for Dworkin, who generally views rights as "trumps" 100 which trump the public interest, but who is willing to recognize the necessity of "preventing a catastrophe" or "to obtain a clear and major public benef t." 101 T e consideration of the public interest must be of such a high level of social importance that society may see it as crucial enough to justify a limitation on its constitutional rights. 102 In addition, it must demonstrate the degree of urgency that would be required according to society's most fundamental values to limit a constitutional right. We will now examine the content of the notion of public interest; the urgency of that purpose will be discussed subsequently. 103

T e content of the public interest is derived from the constitution's basic principles, including the notions of democracy and the rule of law. T e public interest must ref ect the notions of justice and tolerance shared by society. 104 It should ref ect democratic society's general approach towards the people, an approach that may justify, under certain circumstances, the limitation of a constitutional right granted to individuals who constitute a part of that same collective. 105 Without all of those, a constitutional right should not be limited. Note that determining the scope of the category of public interest is still a preliminary examination relating to the component of the proper purpose within proportionality. Accordingly, the other components are not considered at this stage. Rather, the element of the public interest – together with the concomitant requirement of urgency in its realization – constitutes a threshold issue for purposes of proportionality's analysis.

T e public interest category is never closed. T e public interest develops as society itself advances throughout history. T e concrete sub-categories that make up the notion of public interest will now be examined. I do not claim to cover all the sub-categories mentioned in the comparative literature.

 **b. Te continued existence of the state as a democracy** A sub-constitutional law (a statute or the common law) which strives to guarantee the continued existence of the state as a democracy is for a proper purpose. 106 T is approach was expressed in Israel's Basic Law: T e Knesset (Parliament). Article 7a of this Basic Law reads:

> A candidates' list shall not participate in the elections for the Knesset if its objects or actions, expressly or by implication, include one of the following:

- (1) Denying the existence of the State of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state;
- (2) Incitement to racism;
- (3) Support of armed warfare, by either enemy state or a terrorist organization, against the State of Israel. 107

T is is an expression of the State of Israel as a "defensive democracy," or a "militant democracy." 108 Similar provisions may be found in other constitutional texts. T us, for example, the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides:

> Parties that, by reason of their aims or the behavior of their adherents, seek to undermine or abolish the free democratic basic order or to endanger the existence of the Federal Republic of Germany shall be unconstitutional. T e Federal Constitutional Court shall rule on the question of unconstitutionality. 109

 Even without such an express provision in the constitution, the argument that the state has to defend itself against forces who seek to undermine or

Occupation (Art. 2). 107 1958 SH 69. 108 For the term, see A. Saj ó (ed.), Militant Democracy (2004); R. Miller, "Comparative Law and Germany's Militant Democracy," in R. Miller (ed.), US National Security, Intelligence and Democracy 229 (New York: Taylor & Francis, 2008); M. T iel (ed.), T e 'Militant Democracy' Principle in Modern Democracies (2009); R. Miller, "Balancing Security and Liberty in Germany," 4 J. Nat'l Sec. L. & Pol'y 369 ( 2010 ). 109 German Basic Law, Art. 21(2).

to abolish its democratic nature does constitute a proper purpose. A number of constitutions have express articles to the ef ect that the democratic character cannot be changed through a constitutional amendment. 110T e Indian Supreme Court has developed the same doctrine. T us, legislation which protects the democratic character of the regime is for a proper purpose, and legislation meant to harm the democratic regime is not for a proper purpose.

**c. National security** It is widely accepted that the protection of national security interests constitutes a proper purpose, which may serve as justif cation for the limitation of constitutional rights, 111 as long as such protection satisf es the requirement of urgency. 112 Several constitutions expressly refer to the category of national security with regard to several rights, while not doing so with regard to others. 113 Here, too, the absence of an express constitutional provision relating to national security considerations should not be interpreted as a negative solution. T e proper purpose of national security considerations is clearly implied by both the constitutional provisions and the need to protect the democratic nature of the state. 114 T e line drawn between arguments relating to the continued existence of the state as a democracy and national security considerations may, in some cases, be too narrow to be noticed. 115

T e main issue with national security considerations is related not to their recognition as a legitimate proper purpose, but rather to the scope of national security. 116 Obviously, the term "national security" embodies actions taken by the state to f ght its enemies – foreign and domestic – seeking to injure the civil population or national institutions. Here, too, the scope of the category may change from one legal system to another.

 **d. Public order** T e sub-category of public order is important. Without public order we cannot guarantee human rights. "Without order there is no liberty … Democracy is not anarchy." 117 Having said that, it is necessary to carefully examine the scope of this sub-category. 118 T e precise content of the term "public order" may vary from one constitution to another, from one society to the next, and even from one right to another. 119 Specif c provisions relating to the proper purpose of the public order may be found in several international treaties, 120 as well as some constitutions. 121 In other instances, the courts have interpreted public order as an implied constitutional proper purpose. 122

T e scope of the term "public order" is interpreted according to the context in which it appears. It is widely accepted, however, that the prevention of crimes, the protection of minors' interests, and public health fall well within this sub-category. Beyond that, many of the considerations are more controversial. One of the most important aspects of the notion of proper purpose may be ref ected in the meaning given to the sub-category of public order. In order to properly respect and protect human rights we must refrain from providing too wide a meaning to the possibility of limiting it through the notion of public order.

 An interesting question in this context is whether considerations of administrative ef ciency (or administrative convenience) are a proper purpose. Can national budgetary considerations be considered a proper purpose? Although several legal systems have looked into this issue, the answer is far from unequivocal at this stage. For example, the issue came up before the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Singh , 123 where the court examined whether each person seeking the status of refugee in Canada must be granted a right to a hearing. T e state argued that granting such a right to each of the thousands of potential refugees each year

would impose too heavy a burden on the state's budget. T e argument was rejected. In her opinion, Justice Wilson explained:

> I have considerable doubt that the type of utilitarian consideration brought forward by Mr. Bowie can constitute a justif cation for a limitation on the rights set out in the Charter. Certainly the guarantees of the Charter would be illusory if they could be ignored because it was administratively convenient to do so. No doubt considerable time and money can be saved by adopting administrative procedures which ignore the principles of fundamental justice but such an argument, in my view, misses the point of the exercise under Section 1. T e principles of natural justice and procedural fairness which have long been espoused by our courts, and the constitutional entrenchment of the principles of fundamental justice in Section 7, implicitly recognize that a balance of administrative convenience does not override the need to adhere to these principles. Whatever standard of review eventually emerges under Section 1, it seems to me that the basis of the justif cation for the limitation of rights under Section 7 must be more compelling than any advanced in these appeals.124

 Following Singh , however, the Canadian Supreme Court was willing to recognize some instances where there would be prohibitive costs, 125 or where a f nancial crisis was taking place, 126 such that a limitation of a constitutional right may be justif ed.

T e South African Constitutional Court has also examined the issue. In NICRO127 the court was called upon to determine the constitutionality of a statutory amendment that deprived convicted prisoners serving sentences that could not be substituted by a f ne the right to participate in general elections (during the period of their incarceration). Here, too, the state argued that the restriction was intended to prevent logistical and budgetary constraints that would otherwise burden the election committee. T at argument was rejected. Despite that, the Constitutional Court recognized that the consideration of the state's f nancial ability may be taken into consideration in some cases. T e court quoted in that respect an earlier case in which it was held that:

> In the context of South African conditions and resources – political, social, economic and human … [what is reasonable in] one country with

<sup>124</sup> Ibid ., at para. 70. 125 See Hogg, above note 11, at 140; M. P. Singh, German Administrative Law in Common

vast resources, does not necessarily justify placing an identical burden on a country with signif cantly less resources. 128

 Still, the court in NICRO held that a complete denial of the right to vote – which is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa – to an entire category of voters cannot be justif ed through f nancial considerations; this was particularly true in this case, where such a justif cation had not been properly established. Other rulings of the South African Constitutional Court have repeated the notion that mere considerations of administrative convenience or cost saving would not justify, in and of themselves, limitations on constitutional rights. T us, for example, the court held that the state's administrative inconvenience in defending claims against its security forces did not justify a reduction in the statute of limitation period in these cases to a mere six months. T is curtailing of the period, the court ruled, unjustly limits the right to access the courts. 129

 Similar questions have arisen in Israel. T e Israeli Supreme Court had to face – more than once – the issue of whether a constitutionally protected right may be limited due to f nancial considerations or those of administrative convenience or cost-ef ectiveness. As I wrote elsewhere:

> A society that places human rights atop all other protected values must be also ready to pay for them. T e rhetoric of human rights must be backed by a reality that places those rights at the top of the national considerations. T e protection of human rights costs money and a society which respects those rights must be ready to carry the f nancial burden. And note: When a constitutional right is limited, the state cannot defend itself by claiming that it did not have enough resources to protect the right. Should we not hold elections merely because we cannot af ord it? Should we eliminate the right to access the courts because it is f nancially burdensome? 130

 In one case, the state argued that it was not able to provide suitable access to a school for a disabled student, as it would have been too costly. Rejecting this claim, I wrote: "T e guaranteeing of equal opportunities for the disabled is an expensive endeavor. However, a society based on the values of human dignity, liberty, and equality is willing to pay that price." 131 In

<sup>128</sup> Ferreira v. Levin , 1996 (1) SA 984 (CC), § 133. 129 Mohlomi v. Minister of Defence , 1997 (1) SA 124 (CC). 130 See A. Barak, Interpretation in Law: Constitutional Interpretation , vol. III (Jerusalem:

Nevo, 1994 ), 528. 131 HCJ 7081/93 Botzer v. Macabim-Re'ut Regional Municipality [1996] IsrSC 50(1) 19, 27.

another case, Justice Dorner noted that "a basic right, by its own nature, has a social cost … T e protection of basic human rights is not merely the interest of each member of the society, but also an interest of society as a whole; such protection determines the true nature of that society." 132 In another Israeli Supreme Court case, Tzemach , 133 the state argued that one of the reasons for preventing the shortening of the ninety-six-hour detention period for soldiers under military investigation to forty-eight hours is the lack of f nancial resources. Justice Zamir, addressing the claim, suggested that the answer would be dependent upon the "relative weight" of the right in question in relation to the resources required for its realization. He then added:

> Accordingly, what is that "relative weight"? T is issue presents a challenge to Israeli society; such a society is measured, among others, according to the relative weight it assigns to personal liberties. Such "weight" should go beyond mere rhetoric, and beyond the law books; it should appear in the budget books, too. T e protection of human rights comes at a cost. T e society must be willing to pay a reasonable price for its protection on human rights. 134

In another case dealing with age discrimination, I wrote:

 Human rights cost money. Guaranteeing equality costs money … T is is a price both worthy and required in order to ensure our status as a human rights protecting society, which also respects equality. 135

 Accordingly, the Israeli Supreme Court has ruled that the police may not refrain from providing security to a demonstration merely because such a task would lead to a f nancial burden. "T e saving of economic resources, in and of itself, may not serve as a justif cation for refraining from securing the demonstration." 136

T e conclusion arising from this line of "administrative ef ciency" cases is that, because democratic societies assign great value to human rights, the starting point should always be that these rights should receive priority in the national budgetary process. 137T e more central the right is,

<sup>132</sup> HCJ 2316/95 Ganimat v. State of Israel [1995] IsrSC 49(4) 589, 629. 133 HCJ 6055/95 Tzemach v.

IDF Commander in the West Bank [2002] IsrSC 57(2) 349, 384 ("A society which desires both security and individual liberty must pay the price" (Barak, P.)) available at: http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les_eng/02/390/032/A04/02032390. a04.pdf . 136 HCJ 2557/05 Majority Headquarters v. Israel Police [2006] (2) IsrLR 399, 414 (Barak, P.). 137 See Weinrib, above note 97, at 486.

and the more severe the limitation on it is, the more priority should the right receive. However, administrative ef ciency or budgetary constraints may not be ruled out as proper considerations to be weighed within the public interest. Indeed, when a similar argument was made before the Israeli Supreme Court – that economic ef ciency, in and of itself, should never be considered a proper purpose for limitations of human rights – President Beinish rejected the argument and noted that it was "over inclusive since there are circumstances when an economic purpose would be deemed proper enough to justify limitations on a human right." 138 In those instances where the scope of the right includes an express reference to the state's economic means, such consideration should be taken into account. 139 T e same is true in those cases where the state may grant benef ts, as long as the purpose of the grant is not discriminatory.

**e. Tolerance** Can a constitutional right be limited by law in order to ensure social tolerance? Should tolerance be considered part of the public interest, and therefore justify a limitation of a human right? In Israel, the answer provided by the Supreme Court to this question was yes. T e Israeli Supreme Court viewed tolerance as an important social value that may be a proper purpose for limiting a constitutional right. 140 Tolerance constitutes a part of the notion of democracy. It may, therefore, justify the limitation of a constitutional right. What is tolerance, and why may it be used as a justif cation for limiting individual rights?

 Tolerance may be viewed as the demand that a person should respond properly to another person's opinion or behavior, despite the fact that that opinion or behavior is not acceptable to them. 141 Tolerance is an expression

of the personal autonomy of others, and of their freedom to be dif erent. It contains an understanding of our society as pluralistic, a community where dif erent people with dif erent opinions live side-by-side, and where many people wish to express their separate opinions. Democratic regimes are based on the notion of tolerance. T is means tolerance of opinions – and actions – expressed by others in the community. T is might also mean the tolerance of intolerance. In a pluralistic society, tolerance may serve as the uniting force that facilitates co-existence. Indeed, tolerance may serve as both a means and an end. It serves as an important social purpose to which every democratic society should aspire. It serves as a means to balance between other social goals where those conf ict with each other. Tolerance is a central value of social order. If every individual in a democracy would like to fulf ll all of their desires, then the result would be that most wishes would never be fulf lled. Instead, modern society's life is based on the notions of mutual give-and-take. T e tolerance sought is both by individuals towards other individuals and by individuals towards other groups. Similarly, this is the tolerance of groups towards other individuals, and tolerance of groups towards other groups.

 Tolerance means respecting each individual's point of view; a consideration of the opinions and feelings expressed by every human being; and an attempt to understand others' opinions even if those opinions deviate from the norm. Tolerance means a myriad of opinions, ideas, and views co-existing in a single society. T e essence of tolerance is the willingness to compromise; a compromise between the individual and the community, and a compromise between the dif erent individuals in the community. T is compromise does not mean the relinquishing of principles, but rather the relinquishment of the notion that all means may be used to achieve those principles. Despite such dif culties, we should not give up. Without tolerance, there is no liberty.

**f. Feelings** Can the protection of feelings constitute a proper purpose justifying a limitation on a constitutional right? 142 In the Israeli Supreme Court case of Horev , 143 the issue was considered. It was noted

<sup>142</sup> H. L. A. Hart, Law, Liberty, And Morality (Stanford University Press, 1963 ), 35; I. Saban, "Of ensiveness Analyzed: Lessons for Comparative Analysis of Free Speech Doctrines," 2 Journal of International and Comparative Law at Chicago-Kent 60 ( 2002 ); M. Pinto, "What Are Of ences to Feelings Really About?: A New Regulative Principle for the

Multicultural Era," 30 OJLS 695 ( 2010 ). 143 HCJ 5016/96 Horev v. Minister of Transport [1997] IsrSC 51(4) 1. See also HCJ 6126/94 Senesh v. Broadcasting Authority [1999] IsrSC 53(3) 817.

that including feelings as one of the sub-categories justifying limitations on human rights is a complex issue. On the one hand, it is only natural for a democratic society to consider the feelings of its members. "Society, af er all, exists in order to express those feelings." 144 If a constitutional right may be justif ably limited due to harm to life or limb of another, why would it not be justif able in the case of of ending the feelings of another? On the other hand, it is only natural for a right – any right – to of end feelings. "If we allow this cause to justify limitations on human rights, we will f nd ourselves, in the end, questioning the entire framework of human rights. A comprehensive protection of the feelings of others may lead to serious harm – perhaps more serious than we could endure – to the very notion of human rights." 145

 How could we resolve such a complex issue? In Israel, the case law refused to adopt an "all or nothing" approach; rather, the approach adopted has been that an of ense to the feelings may constitute a proper purpose, but only if the harm to feelings was so severe that it exceeded the "tolerance level" acceptable to society. 146 In one such case, Justice Proccacia characterized the nature of such an injury, "which shocks the very foundations of mutual tolerance in a democracy," as follows: "Such an of ense may occur only when it relates to the very moral fabric that def nes us as individuals and as a society; an of ense that questions the very assumptions upon which we are based (as a democracy) in a way that may harm our national and social structure; and where providing the proper answer to that question would be either impossible or nearly so." 147

 Two issues should be noted in this respect: First, in some cases the feelings are protected within the scope of a constitutional right. T us, for example, in those legal systems where human dignity is recognized as a constitutional right, protection of feelings may well be considered part of protecting human dignity.

mutual tolerance in our society." (Barak, P.)). 147 HCJ 316/03 Muhammad Bakri v. T e Israel Film Council [2003] IsrSC 58(1) 249, 279, available at http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les_eng/03/160/003/L15/03003160.l15.pdf .

of respect for feelings is merely a part of the well-recognized concept of protection of the rights of others. In addition, an of ense to feelings may be viewed as interference with the public order. 148 Second, the "level of tolerance" may change in accordance with the right in question. 149

**g. Constitutional principles** T e purpose of a law limiting a constitutional right is proper if it seeks to realize constitutional principles. Among those we can include the separation of powers, 150 the rule of law, 151 and the independence of the judiciary. 152 Alongside these principles, the constitution also includes a set of principles that ref ect the objective aspect of constitutional rights. 153 Indeed, constitutional rights are aimed, f rst and foremost, at the state. T is is the "subjective" aspect of constitutional rights. But they have an additional aspect. T ey are also an expression of the objective principles of the constitution. 154 As the German Constitutional Court noted in Lüth :

> [T]he Basic Law is not a value-neutral document … Its section on basic rights establishes an objective order of values, and this order strongly reinforces the ef ective power of basic rights. T is value system, which centers upon dignity of the human personality developing freely within the social community, must be looked upon as a fundamental constitutional decision af ecting all spheres of law. It serves as a yardstick for measuring and assessing all actions in the areas of legislation, public administration, and adjudication. 155

T is approach has several implications. 156 For our purposes it means that a law limiting a constitutional right in order to realize an objective value derived from the subjective constitutional rights may be considered as doing so for a proper purpose. In many cases, this sub-category would parallel that of the protection of the rights of others. T is is true in many cases, but not all. T e objective values may extend beyond the areas where the individual has constitutional rights. T us, for example, even constitutions recognizing human dignity as a right do not always recognize a (subjective) right to such dignity af er death; but the objective value of human dignity may apply in that area for purposes of guaranteeing a proper burial. 157

# **D. Te urgency of proper purpose**

### 1. T e problems with urgency

 For the purpose of a law limiting a constitutional right to be proper, two requirements must be met. First, the law's content should be proper, and, second, its urgency should be proper. T e f rst requirement – relating to content – was examined in the previous pages. T e urgency requirement will now be discussed. T is requirement poses two separate issues. T e f rst questions the status of urgency as an independent requirement: would the purpose requirement not be suf cient in itself, without the need to consider the urgency of the purpose as an independent and separate requirement? In particular, the claim is that it would be more appropriate to examine the issue of urgency during other stages of the proportionality test, in particular proportionality stricto sensu – the balancing between the benef ts obtained by realizing the proper purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right in question. It is only af er we agree that urgency should be examined during the threshold stage of the proper purpose that we can move on the second issue, which tries to determine the precise criterion by which such urgency should be determined. For example, should the same degree of urgency be required for each constitutional right? If so what degree would that be? Perhaps the right solution is to require dif erent degrees of urgency for each constitutional right? If

<sup>156</sup> One of which is related to the application of constitutional rights within private law; see above, at 39. Another is related to the duty of the state to af rmatively protect human rights rather than guard against their limitation. See below, at 422.

<sup>157</sup> CA 294/91 Burial Society v. Kestenbaum [1992] 46 (2) PD 464.

that is the case, what would then be the criterion for determining such varying degrees of urgency?

### 2. Is "urgency" required?

 A strong argument can be made that, if the purpose of the limiting law is proper, this is suf cient and no other requirement should be added – for example, urgency – to enable the realization of that purpose. According to this argument, the examination of the proper purpose is a threshold examination. T is threshold examination should not include the degree of urgency in realizing that purpose while limiting a human right. T is examination should only be conducted when examining the proportional relationship between the benef ts in realizing the purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right in question. According to that claim, during the balancing stage, we could examine the urgency of the purpose and the need for its realization. T is is the approach adopted in German constitutional law. 158 T ere, the issue of the purpose's urgency is not examined during the f rst stage as a threshold question within the framework of the proper purpose. Rather, it is considered during the last stage of the examination, that of proportionality stricto sensu .

T is approach, however, has been rejected in Canada 159 and South Africa. 160 In those legal systems, it was ruled that, during the threshold stage, it would be insuf cient for the purpose to be proper in terms of its content only; rather, a certain degree of urgency is also required. According to that approach, there is no need to further examine the proportionality of the means used by the limiting law when the realization of the purpose of the limiting law is not urgent enough.

 What is the proper approach? T e issue is not free from doubt. On the one hand, we should acknowledge the close proximity between the examination of the purpose's urgency regarding the proper purpose and the examination of the urgency of the purpose in relation to the balancing within proportionality stricto sensu . 161 T e importance of the purpose in relation to the balancing in the last stage includes, as a theoretical matter, an examination of how urgent the purpose really is. 162 On the other hand, it is worthwhile to examine the propriety of the purpose without the need

- 158 See Grimm, above note 15. 159 See below, at 279. 160 See Woolman and Botha, above note 25, at 73. 161 See below, at 340. 162 See above, at 362.
- 

to refer to the degree the constitutional right is limited. If the purpose is deemed improper due to a lack of urgency, what would be the point in "delaying" this discussion to the last stage of the examination? It would be much better to determine this issue during the threshold examination of a proper purpose. Still, we should be careful not to turn this threshold stage into a balancing examination – where a balance between the degree of urgency of the limiting law and the harm caused to the constitutional right in question is carried out.

### 3. Criteria for determining urgency

## i. No single model

 Comparative law reveals no uniform approach relating to the criterion by which the urgency of the purpose should be determined. Instead, several models are used. T e dif erences between the dif erent models can be explained by the varying structures of the provisions dealing with human rights in dif erent constitutions, as well as the dif erent starting points with respect to democracy and its values. Another major dif erence that may have led to the use of dif erent models is related to the understanding of the concept of human rights: should they all be treated as equal, or are there rights that are considered more important than others? Here, the two main models will be examined. T e f rst model uses a single, unif ed level of urgency. T us, this model does not distinguish, regarding the level of urgency, between the dif erent proper purposes or the dif erent limited rights. Here, only a single level of urgency is set. T is is the accepted model in Canada and South Africa. T e second model does not determine a unif ed level of urgency; rather, it uses several levels while taking into consideration the importance of each limited right in question. T is is the American model.

### ii. T e f rst model: Canada and South Africa

**a. Te Oakes test** T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms contains a general limitation clause. T e clause states that the rights and freedoms set out in the Charter are "subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society." 163 In Oakes , the Canadian Supreme Court provided

163 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, above note 6, Section 1.

an authoritative and comprehensive interpretation of this clause. 164 T e Court established a unif ed examination for the urgency of the purpose of the limiting law; this examination is applicable, according to the Court, to each and every right and freedom set out in the Charter. According to this examination, a high degree of urgency is required for the purpose of a law limiting a constitutional right. T e purpose should be of fundamental importance. It must be "pressing and substantial." 165 Regarding the level of urgency of the purposes limiting the constitutional right, the Court ruled in Oakes that:

> [T]he objective, which the measures responsible for a limit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to serve, must be of "suf cient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom." T e standard must be high in order to ensure that objectives which are trivial or discordant with the principles integral to a free and democratic society do not gain Section 1 protection. It is necessary, at a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as suf ciently important. 166

T e criterion set by the Court in Oakes has two distinct elements. First, it serves as a unif ed criterion, which applies as a minimum to all rights. Second, the criterion sets a high standard, which only the most urgent of purposes can realize. Each of these features will now be examined. 167

 **b. Uniform standard for the limitation of all rights** T e Court in Oakes had established a uniform standard for the degree of urgency of the purpose of a norm limiting a constitutional right. All constitutional rights are equal in importance in that regard. Whatever the right, whatever the scope of its limitation, the standard remains the same with regard to the purpose of the limiting law. T at uniform standard requires that the purposes of the limiting law be of suf cient importance and that they relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society.

T e uniformity of the standard has been criticized. It was argued that a strict standard is not wanted, 168 and that the myriad of situations in which the standard should apply renders its uniform application nearly

<sup>164</sup> See Oakes , above note 61. 165 Ibid ., at 136. 166 Ibid ., at 138. 167 See Weinrib, above note 102. See also R. M. Elliot, "T e Supreme Court of Canada and Section 1 – T e Erosion of the Common Front," 12 Queen's L. J . 277 ( 1987 ). 168 R . v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd . [1986] 2 SCR 713.

impracticable. 169 It is hard, the argument goes on, to compare cases in which the rights of an individual who faces proceedings initiated by the state are at stake (e.g., the rights of the accused in criminal cases) to cases where the state is called upon to fairly allocate its resources between several groups in the community. While the f rst group of cases may justify a uniform standard, it is much harder to justify such uniformity in the second group of cases. T at group, the argument continues, should be lef for the people to decide through democratic determination, through the legislative body, which should be reasonably free to choose between several polycentric considerations. T us, for example, Justice La Forest emphasized the need to provide the legislator with "reasonable room to manoeuvre." 170

 It was held that the Oakes test – including the purpose's degree of urgency – is not decisive but should rather serve as a list of factors to be taken into account. T e emphasis should be on the context in which the right appears, rather than an abstract examination of the right in question. 171 Chief Justice Dickson himself, who authored the Oakes opinion, joined this approach in another case where he wrote: "T e application of the Oakes approach will vary depending on the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the interests at stake." 172T e need to consider circumstances, naturally, makes dif cult the very existence of a uniform standard; in addition, it also questions the standard's high level. T is aspect will now be examined.

**c. Strict criterion setting a high standard** T e second aspect of the Oakes test relating to the degree of urgency of a law limiting a constitutional right is that the uniform standard "must be high." T e threshold that the limiting law is required to pass is high. T e requirement is that the limitation of a constitutional right must be justif ed by a fundamental need, which is "pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society." T is strict requirement has set very high standards for the limitation of all rights; in fact, the standard was set so high that the Canadian courts could hardly meet it. T us, soon af er the Oakes decision was rendered, the Canadian

<sup>169</sup> RJR-MacDonald Inc . v. Canada (Attorney General) [1995] 3 SCR 199. See also P. G. Murray, "Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: An Examination at Two Levels of Interpretation," 21 Ottawa L. Rev . 631 ( 1989 ); G. V. La Forest, "T e Balancing of

Interests under the Charter," 2 Nat'l. J. Const. L . 132 ( 1992 ). 170 See Edwards , above note 168, at 795; La Forest, above note 169, at 145. 171 See La Forest, ibid ., at 146. 172 R . v. Keegstra [1990] 3 SCR 697, 738.

Supreme Court held that a less strict approach was in order. 173T e reason for that decision was that the high standard set by the Oakes test may have prevented the realization of some important social and economic goals which, although they may not be "pressing and substantial," are certainly reasonable and therefore should be considered "proper." T us, for example, Justice McIntyre stressed in Andrews that a more f exible standard is required: "To hold otherwise would frequently deny the community-at-large the benef ts associated with sound social and economic legislation." 174

 Cracks were found in Oakes ' "united front." 175 And, while Oakes was never formally overruled by the Canadian Supreme Court, it instead began to serve as the framework used to distinguish between several types of cases. 176 T us, for example, it was stressed that the principles underlying the dif erent rights may vary in terms of their weight depending on the constitutional circumstances in question. In that way, the context began to play a larger role in determining the constitutionality of the laws attempting to limit constitutional rights. As Justice Wilson noted in the Edmonton Journal case:

> One virtue of the contextual approach, it seems to me, is that it recognizes that a particular right or freedom may have a dif erent value depending on the context. It may be, for example, that freedom of expression has greater value in a political context than it does in the context of disclosure of the details of a matrimonial dispute. T e contextual approach attempts to bring into sharp relief the aspect of the right or freedom which is truly at stake in the case as well as the relevant aspects of any values in competition with it. It seems to be more sensitive to the reality of the dilemma posed by the particular facts and therefore more conductive to f nding a fair and just compromise between two competing values under Section 1. 177

 What then remains of Oakes ? Does the uniform examination still apply? Is the requirement that the proper purpose be of fundamental importance and relate to a concern that is "pressing and substantial" still valid? Or has a new paradigm begun – under the umbrella of the contextual approach – according to which dif erent tests would apply to dif erent circumstances? 178

Whatever the case may be, the new developments pay – at the very least – lip service to Oakes , while the actual role of the proper purpose is not as central as it has been. 179 Hogg notes that there are few cases where the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the purpose of the legislation does not realize the threshold that it itself has set:

> In practice … the requirement of a suf ciently important objective has been satisf ed in all but one or two of the Charter cases that have reached the Supreme Court of Canada. It has been easy to persuade the Court that, when the Parliament or Legislature acts in derogation of individual rights, it is doing so to further values that are acceptable in a free and democratic society, to satisfy concerns that are pressing and substantial and to realize collective goals of fundamental importance. 180

 **d. South Africa** T e Constitution of the Republic of South Africa acknowledges that the rights included therein may be limited in some circumstances, including, inter alia , by taking into account "the importance of the purpose of the limitation." 181 Woolman and Botha refer to the Canadian Oakes case regarding the question of urgency, thus adopting the idea that the purpose should be "pressing and substantial." 182 T e Constitutional Court, however, has yet to discuss that question. It is unlikely that the Court would follow in the footsteps of Oakes . T e reason for this is that Oakes is based on the premise that all rights are equally important in the eyes of the constitution. No right is more important than another. 183 Accordingly, only one, unif ed standard is required. T is is not the approach adopted by the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. T ere, the general limitation clause specif cally mentions the "nature of the right" as one of the factors to be taken into account when reviewing the proportionality of the limitation. 184 In addition, even assuming, arguendo , that the Oakes test would be adopted by the South African courts, the constitution itself holds that this factor – the importance of the purpose – is not the decisive factor, but is instead one of several

 considerations to be taken into account before determining the constitutionality of the limitation. 185

**e. Te second model: the United States** T e Bill of Rights contains no explicit (general or specif c) limitation clause. Despite the "absolute" nature of some of the rights enumerated in the American Constitution, the American Supreme Court has held, in a long line of cases, that these rights can be limited. 186 T e Court divides all constitutional rights into three major categories, 187 with each category earning a separate degree of urgency which characterizes it. Importantly, each category separately examines the purpose of the limiting law and the means used by it to realize that purpose. Only the f rst part – the purpose and the degree of urgency required – is dealt with here.

T e f rst category of rights relates to those rights which require " strict scrutiny." 188 T e rights included in this group are the fundamental rights, such as the rights within the First Amendment freedom of political speech, freedom of the press, the right to peacefully assemble, the free exercise of religion, the right of movement within US borders, the right to vote, and the right to equal protection of the laws in relation to a suspect classif cation (based on either race or national origin). In order to justify a limitation of one of those rights, the limiting legislative provision must serve a "compelling state interest" (or a "pressing public necessity" or a "substantial state interest"). T e second category of rights is that of "intermediate scrutiny." 189T is group includes, among others, equal-protection legislation relating to quasi-suspect classif cations (based on gender or age), the right to commercial freedom of speech, and the public forum free-speech doctrine. In order to justify a limitation on rights included in this category, the legislative provision in question must have an "important governmental objective." T e third and f nal category is that of "minimal scrutiny" or "rational basis review." 190 T is category applies to all the other rights recognized by the Bill of Rights. Here, all the limiting legislative provision has to overcome to be justif ed is to show that it serves a "legitimate governmental objective."

 Accordingly, the American approach is characterized by a lack of a uniform standard for examining the urgency of the proper purpose that

<sup>185</sup> Ibid ., Art. 36(1). 186 See below, at 509. 187 See below, at 509. 188 Regarding this category, see below, at 510. 189 Regarding this category, see below, at 511. 190 Regarding this category, see below, at 511.

limits the constitutional right. According to the American approach, not all rights are of equal importance. T us, a higher – and strict – standard was set in order to limit the rights with the higher social value. Indeed, few laws ever succeed in passing strict scrutiny. As Gunther noted, strict scrutiny is "strict in theory but fatal in fact." 191 Limiting rights in the second category, although not as hard, is also not a trivial matter – the standard is set quite high. Only the third category of the standard is set very low, and most legislative provisions pass the "rational connection" test and are thus able to limit the rights included in that group.

T e comparative lesson to be learned from the American experience is important, though limited. It is important, as the lesson well demonstrates, that there is no need for a single uniform standard for the degree of urgency required for the limiting law; rather, separate standards may be set in accordance with the relative value of each limited right – since not all rights are of equal value. 192 Still, the lesson is limited, in that none of the categories includes the notion of balancing between the benef t gained by realizing the proper purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right. 193 T e concept of proportionality is built not only on the notion of a proper purpose, but also on the existence of a proportional relationship between the benef t gained by the realization of that purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right. T e very existence of this additional step – the examination of proportionality stricto sensu – may af ect the standards that should be determined during the f rst stage of the constitutional review.

# **E. Identifying the proper purpose**

### 1. T e purposes of the limiting law

 So far this book has focused primarily on constitutional interpretation in relation to the notion of proper purpose. It now turns from the constitutional to the sub-constitutional level. T e examination will now consider how one could determine whether the limiting law, which operates at the

<sup>191</sup> See G. Gunther, "T e Supreme Court 1971 Term – Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection," 86 Harv. L. Rev . 1, 8 ( 1972 ); S.

sub-constitutional level, successfully meets the requirements set out in the constitution with regard to the proper purpose. T is discussion takes place at the sub-constitutional level. T e question is whether the sub-constitutional law actually follows – and abides by – all the requirements presented by the constitutional provisions regarding the proper purpose. My goal here is to examine the criteria by which we may identify the purposes underlying the limiting law.

T e identif cation of the purposes underlying the limiting law is not an easy task. In most cases, laws limiting constitutional rights do not appear before us with signs indicating their purpose. Moreover, even if such signs do exist – as in a "purpose clause" 194 – the issue is far from settled; the question of whether such a provision should serve as the f nal arbiter for the issue of purpose remains a valid one. Of the many issues arising from such a situation, two will be focused on. T e f rst question is whether the purpose of a limiting law can be identif ed by the intentions of the creators of that law at the time it became a law ("subjective test"), or according to the meaning of the law's purpose at the time it is interpreted ("objective test"). Perhaps it should be identif ed in accordance with some combination of the two? If the answer to this f rst question entails a requirement to examine the subjective intent of the law's creators, then the second question becomes relevant: how can we identify the subjective purpose of the law's creators?

### 2. Subjective or objective test?

### i. T e issue def ned

 In most instances, the legislator's intent at the time of enactment and the purpose that the statute pursues are identical, or at the very least very similar. T is is true in most cases, but not all. In some cases, there is a gap between the subjective purposes that the legislator intended the statute to serve at the time of its enactment and the objective purposes the statute realizes at the time of its interpretation. 195 Mostly, this is a function of the time that has passed between enactment and interpretation. An example of this phenomenon – which repeats itself in several legal systems – is

<sup>194</sup> See F. Bennion, Statutory Interpretation: A Code , 4th edn. (London: Butterworths,

 <sup>2002 ). 195</sup> On the dif erence between subjective and objective purpose, see A. Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law (Sari Bashi trans., Princeton University Press, 2005), 10.

the " Sunday Laws." 196 During their enactment, these laws – which restrict work or trade on Sundays – were intended to serve a religious purpose. Over the years, however, they were interpreted by the courts objectively as serving a social – rather than a religious – purpose, namely, to provide a mandatory day of rest for workers. Let us assume now that the old (religious) purpose is perceived today as unconstitutional, while the new (social) purpose is deemed constitutional. Which of the two is the relevant purpose for determining the constitutionality of the law?

T is change, over time, to the statute's purpose raises a real dif culty in trying to identify the purpose of the limiting statute in terms of it being "proper." Does the original subjective purpose of the limiting law determine the issue of proper purpose, or is it the new, objective purpose? Also, perhaps we are looking at a dual requirement, in that both the subjective purpose at the time of enactment and the objective purpose during interpretation should be constitutionally "proper." With respect to the example of the Sunday Laws, in order to identify the proper purpose, should the original subjective (religious) purpose govern, or should the new objective (social) purpose govern? Perhaps both purposes should be considered? In order to answer this question, we should focus on two dif erent aspects. T e f rst is the interpretive aspect. Here, the question is how do we provide meaning to the legislative provision – should it be interpreted in accordance with its subjective or objective purpose? While discussing this aspect we do not examine issues of constitutionality. T e second aspect is constitutional; it deals with the proper purpose as def ned by the limitation clause. Here, the question is: what is the relevant legislative purpose to the issue of the constitutionality of the legislative provision? T e f rst aspect relates to meaning. T e second relates to validity. 197 Each of these aspects, beginning with the f rst, will be discussed below.

### ii. T e interpretive aspect

 Dif erent approaches were adopted by dif erent legal systems with regard to the interpretive aspect. T ere are those who interpret laws according to their original intent (intentionalism) and there are those who interpret laws according to the original understanding (originalism). Others interpret law according to their objective purpose at the time of

<sup>196</sup> See Hogg, above note 11, at 136; L. H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law , 2nd edn. (Mineola, NY: Foundation Press, 1988 ), 1205. 197 For the distinction, see Barak, Purposive Interpretation , above note 130.

interpretation. 198 According to the purposive method of interpretation, in certain instances, including laws which af ect human rights, the law should be given a meaning most suitable to its objective purposes at the time the interpretation is made. T e interpretation is dynamic. 199 T e law is "always speaking." 200 As I explained elsewhere, through dynamic interpretation,

> [i]t is possible to give legislation a modern interpretation to suit modern needs. T e language of the statute remains as before, but its meaning has changed to adapt the law to contemporary conditions. An example is a law passed by a nondemocratic regime. When the regime changes and democracy reigns, the law was interpreted according to democratic values, narrowing the gap between law and society. But beyond that, through interpretation and by understanding the text's (objective) purpose – new fundamental principles are introduced into the legal system. 201

 An example for that interpretive approach was provided by the Israeli Supreme Court, when interpreting legislation enacted during the British mandate over Palestine. In a long line of cases, the Court established the notion that the old legislation should be interpreted not in accordance with its old (non-democratic) intent, but rather in accordance with the values of the new, democratic State of Israel. 202 Accordingly, old British mandate legislation intended to curtail freedom of speech was interpreted not in light of its original intent, but according to the values of the State of Israel as a democracy at the time that the legislation was interpreted. Should the same approach apply to the identif cation of the purposes of the law in the constitutional context? T is aspect will now be examined.

### iii. T e constitutional aspect

 In the context of the limitation clause, the subjective or objective nature of the purpose is not an interpretive matter. We are not dealing with the question of how to understand the old legislation. Rather, the matter concerns

constitutionality. T e issue is whether the constitutionality of a legislative provision, which was enacted (initially) for an improper subjective purpose, is determined by its historic purpose (which is not proper), or by its current objective purpose (which is proper), or whether the issue of constitutionality should be determined in accordance with both purposes. 203

T e starting point to answer this question must lie in the understanding that the criteria used for the interpretation of a limiting law are not identical to the criteria used to determine its constitutionality. Issues of meaning are not the same as issues of validity. When we interpret the statute purposively, we assume that the legislator acted in accordance with the constitution, and the only question before us is what is the message the statute meant to convey to members of society at the time of its interpretation? In that respect, we are assisted by an approach according to which, between two interpretations – assuming all other conditions are equal – we should always prefer the interpretation that is constitutional. 204 T is is not the case, and this doctrine cannot be used, when we examine the constitutionality of the provision itself. When the issue of the statutory provision's constitutionality is on the line, the examination is focused on the question of whether that provision satisf es all the constitutionality requirements. In particular, the question is whether the constitutional validity of the limiting law should be determined by its (subjective) purposes at the time the law was created, by its (objective) purposes at the time of its interpretation, or according to both.

### iv. A survey of comparative law

**a. Canada** At f rst, the approach adopted by the Canadian Supreme Court in relation to the constitutionality of a statutory provision was that the original purpose envisioned by the legislator at the time of the enactment should prevail. One should not consider, using this approach, any social changes that took place af er the legislation's enactment that may justify another purpose at the time of the law's interpretation. T us, for example, in Big M , 205 the Court examined a Sunday Law (the "Lord's Day

<sup>203</sup> See J. Rivers, "Proportionality and Variable Intensity of Review," 65 Cambridge L. J . 174,

<sup>196 ( 2006 ). 204</sup> For an interpretation that matches the constitution, see below, at 445; US ex rel. Attorney General v. Delaware & Hudson Co ., 213 US 366, 407 (1909) ("It is elementary when the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save the statute from constitutional inf rmity."). 205 R . v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd . [1985] 1 SCR 295.

Act"), which restricted the opening of businesses on Sundays. At the time of its enactment, the (subjective) purpose envisioned by the legislators was a religious one. T is purpose was not perceived as "proper" at the time of the act's constitutional review; however, at the time of the review, the (objective) purpose of the law, which was social, was perceived as proper. T e issue, however, was still unresolved: According to which purpose should the law's constitutionality be determined – the subjective or the objective one? T e Canadian Supreme Court held that only the subjective purpose should be considered at a time when the constitutionality of the law is being examined. As Chief Justice Dickson noted: "Purpose is a function of the intent of those who draf ed and enacted the legislation at the time, and not of any shif ing variable." 206

 Not long af er the Big M case was decided, however, the Canadian Supreme Court had an opportunity to reexamine the issue. In Butler , 207 the Court repeated its approach that the purpose's change over time should not be a determining factor; however, the Court added an important exception, according to which a "shif in emphasis" over time – as opposed to a shif in the purpose itself – may be considered by a court in determining the law's purpose. Butler dealt with a criminal restriction on the distribution of obscene materials. T is restriction limited the freedom of speech. T e historical purpose, envisioned by the legislators, was the advancement of moral values. T e Court held that such a purpose is not proper. T e Court continued to hold, however, that, according to modern social trends, this kind of restriction also serves the purpose of equality between the sexes – a proper purpose by all accounts. But, in his opinion, Justice Sopinka explained that the original purpose the law was intended to serve was, in fact, the prevention of the harm caused by obscene materials. T e shif over time in what that damage actually consisted of was nothing more than a "shif in emphasis," according to him.

T e same year (1992) that Butler was decided, the Canadian Supreme Court also decided Zundel . 208 T ere, the Court examined the constitutionality of a law prohibiting the publication of false information or news. Zundel, a Holocaust denier, was convicted of spreading false news. T e Court held that the criminal prohibition limited the constitutional right to freedom of speech. T e original purpose of the act was to protect senior of cials – originally the monarchy and later the government – by protecting their reputation. T is purpose, the Court held, could no longer be

206 Ibid ., at 335. 207 R . v. Butler [1992] 1 SCR 452. 208 See R. v. Zundel [1992] 1 SCR 731.

considered "proper." T e current purpose of the law, however, is to secure social harmony, which, according to the Court, was a proper purpose. Does the move from the original purpose into the new one constitute "shif ing objectives" (which should not be considered by the Court), or merely a "shif in emphasis" (which may be considered)? T e Court was divided in answering this question. T e majority opinion, authored by Justice McLachlin, held that the move from the f rst purpose (protection of senior of cials) to the second purpose (social harmony) should not be considered by the Court as it constitutes a shif ing objective rather than merely a shif in emphasis. Accordingly, the law was declared unconstitutional. T e dissent, by Justices Cory and Iacobucci, was of the opinion that the restriction in question has always had, as a primary purpose, the prevention of damage caused by the dissemination of false information. T e only thing that the new purpose constitutes, according to this line of thought, is a shif in emphasis; and therefore, the law was constitutional.

 Hogg explains the Butler exception by arguing that the Court is aiming at a purpose at the highest level of abstraction. 209 Here, he is def nitely correct. But that might also miss the real issue. T e issue is whether the purpose – read at its highest level of abstraction – is the subjective purpose, set at the time the provision was enacted. If this is the case, then viewing the purpose at a proper level of abstraction may be considered by the Court as a "shif in emphasis," and therefore permitted. However, if the Court were to view that dif erent, higher level of abstraction as a new purpose, not considered earlier, then the result would be dif erent. If that is the case, then this new purpose would constitute a "shif in purpose," and therefore its consideration would not be permitted by the Court, according to the approach in Big M .

 **b. South Africa** T e issue was examined in South African in the Jordan case. 210 T ere, the Constitutional Court reviewed the constitutionality of a criminal prohibition of running a brothel. T e enactment of the prohibition, the Court held, was meant to protect a certain moral point of view. Such protection was deemed inappropriate at the time of the trial, as it did not take into consideration the values of a pluralistic society. Despite that, the Court (Justices O'Regan and Sachs) was of the opinion that the same law could be attributed a "modern" purpose, such as the regulation of the sex trade. In the Justices' view, this purpose is a proper one in a democratic society. A year earlier, in the Moseneke

209 See Hogg above note 11, at 137. 210 S . v. Jordan , 2002 (6) SA 642.

case, 211 the same court reached a dif erent result. T ere, the Court dealt with laws enacted during the Apartheid regime, which distinguished, for the purposes of handling the estates of intestate deceased persons, between black people and white people. T e Constitutional Court has held that the law is so deeply grounded in the Apartheid past that no attempt should be made to salvage it by looking for a more modern, proper purpose.

T e question yet to be resolved in South Africa is where precisely the line should be drawn between these two approaches. Is the degree of deviation from the proper essence of the purpose determinative? Woolman and Botha have warned, af er quoting both opinions, that:

> [I]t must also remain on guard that less overt or pernicious forms of discrimination – or state support for particular traditions, religions or worldviews that marginalize smaller, more vulnerable groups – may be countenanced in the name of a new, ostensibly unproblematic purpose. 212

# **c. United States**

aa. T e lack of a uniform solutionT e American legal system does not provide a uniform solution to the question of whether the proper purpose, in relation to the constitutionality of a legislative provision, should be determined in accordance with subjective or objective tests. 213 As in the case of other constitutional law issues, the American approach is to break up the examination into three levels of scrutiny: minimal, intermediate, and strict. 214 T e solution to the question varies with each level of scrutiny. Accordingly, it is impossible to speak about a uniform, allencompassing theory of proper purposes, but rather each right is examined according to its special approach, the level of scrutiny derived from its location on the level of examination.

bb. Minimal scrutiny T is level of scrutiny applies to all constitutional rights that are not included within the other two levels of scrutiny (intermediate and strict). 215T us, this category includes economic and property

rights, and the right not to be discriminated against when the discrimination is not based on a "suspect" classif cation – such as one based on race or national origin – or a "quasi-suspect" classif cation – such as one based on gender or age – is involved. When a law limits one of those rights, all that is required for the law's purpose to be valid is that it serve a "legitimate governmental interest." 216

 Does American law require that the purpose in question be the one envisioned at the time of the enactment? Or is it enough that the purpose is "proper" at the time the legislation is examined by the courts? T e answer, according to the US Supreme Court, is that only the existence of an objective legitimate purpose should be considered. As Justice Rehnquist has observed:

> Where, as here, there are plausible reasons for Congress' action, our inquiry is at an end. It is, of course, "Constitutionally irrelevant whether this reasoning in fact underlay the legislative decision" because this Court has never insisted that a legislative body articulate its reasons for enacting a statute. 217

 Accordingly, it is suf cient that an objective legitimate purpose be assigned to the legislative provision, regardless of whether this purpose was in fact the one envisioned by the legislator at the time of enactment. T us, in order to successfully claim that the statute's purpose is not "proper," one must deny the existence of every possible legitimate purpose. As Justice T omas has noted:

> [T]hose attacking the rationality of the legislative classif cation have the burden "to negative every conceivable basis which might support it." [B] ecause we never require a legislature to articulate its reasons for enacting a statute, it is entirely irrelevant for constitutional purposes whether the conceived reason for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature … [A] legislative choice is not subject to courtroom fact-f nding and may be based on rational speculation unsupported by evidence or empirical data. 218

 Only in a small number of cases has the legislation failed such a lenient test.

cc. Strict and intermediate scrutinyStrict scrutiny applies in cases of "suspect" discrimination (based on race or national origin), or in cases limiting fundamental First Amendment rights such as the freedom of expression (other than commercial freedom of speech and zoning restrictions regarding pornographic expression), and the freedom of religion, freedom of movement and the right to vote. 219 At this level of scrutiny, the legislation must satisfy the test of a "compelling state interest," a "pressing public necessity," or a "substantial state interest." 220 Intermediate scrutiny applies in cases of a "quasi-suspect" classif cation (based on gender or age), or in cases of commercial freedom of speech, or of zoning restrictions regarding pornographic expression. Here, the legislation in question must satisfy the "important governmental objective" test. 221

 In all these cases, one has to show – regarding the proper purpose – that the limitation of the right abides by all the requirements presented by that level of scrutiny, and particularly those terms relating to the component of purpose. Again, the issue arises: which purpose determines – the one that the legislator himself (as a subjective matter) envisioned at the time of the enactment, or the one that the provision actually fulf lls, objectively? T is question plays a special role when the legislation in question is related to equal-protection cases, relating to the right to equality before the law. In order to disqualify a law limiting the right to equality, is it enough to show that the original purpose of the law was to discriminate (and not to advance the relevant social interest), or is it enough to show that the law has a discriminate impact – that is, it actually discriminates?

T e general question – relating to the relevance of the original intent of the legislation in the strict and intermediate levels of scrutiny – has no uniform answer. Rather, the answer varies according to the right in question, and, at times, within the boundaries of the right itself in accordance with judge-made distinctions created over the years. Here, the discussion will be limited to two rights included at the highest level of scrutiny, the strict scrutiny level. T ese are the prohibition of discrimination and the right to freedom of expression. Is the legislator's original intention relevant in examining the existence of a compelling state interest?

dd. T e relevance of intent in the limitation of equality American history, more than any other factor, dictates the judicial treatment of this issue. Until the Civil War, slavery was prevalent in the South. Af er the

conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, the US Constitution was amended by the T irteenth Amendment, which prohibited slavery. T ree years later, in 1868, the Constitution was amended once again. T e Fourteenth Amendment guaranteed, to "any person" within the United States, "the equal protection of the laws." T e Supreme Court has held that the purpose of legislation attempting to limit equality should be reviewed at the highest level of scrutiny – strict scrutiny. 222 Accordingly, only a compelling state interest, a pressing public necessity, or a substantial state interest can satisfy the inquiry and justify a limitation on the right to equality (provided that other conditions are met 223 ). T e main reason – though not the only one – behind the Fourteenth Amendment, in this context, was the elimination of race-based discrimination.

 How should legislative purposes which limit the right to equality be treated? In attempting to answer this question, American constitutional law has drawn a distinction between two sets of purposes which limit equality. 224 In the f rst, the alleged limitation of equality may be inferred directly from the legislative text (a limitation "on the face of the law"). T is is the case, for example, when the provision in question makes race-based classif cations. In the second set of cases, the law is "facially neutral," but its purpose, or impact, allegedly violates the right to equality.

 According to the American approach, legislation creating a race-based classif cation is to be reviewed under the strict scrutiny test. 225 T e provision can survive the test only if it can be proven – in relation to its purpose – that it was meant to achieve a compelling or substantial state interest, or a pressing public necessity. A subjective discriminatory purpose, therefore, may deny the existence of the required purpose.

 How should a facially neutral provision be treated? In order to be reviewed under the strict scrutiny test, such a provision must satisfy the following conditions. 226 First, the subjective purpose of the law should be discriminatory; second, the impact of the law should also be discriminatory. Both conditions must be met in order for the law to be reviewed under strict scrutiny. If only one of the two conditions exists, the law is to be reviewed under minimal scrutiny.

<sup>222</sup> See Tribe, above note 196, at 145. 223 See below, at 510. 224 L. H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law , 3rd edn. (Mineola, NY: Foundation Press,

<sup>2000), 1502. 225</sup> R. H. Fallon, "Strict Judicial Scrutiny," 54 UCLA L. Rev . 1267 ( 2007 ). 226 See Chemerinsky, above note 216, at 710.

 When can we say that the provision's purpose is discriminatory? According to American law, a purpose is discriminatory whenever the legislator intended to discriminate, or, in other words, envisioned a discriminatory purpose. It is therefore insuf cient that members of Congress envisioned a discriminatory impact, or that they were indif erent to the existence of a discriminatory purpose; instead, they had to have had the intent to discriminate. T is was the position of the US Supreme Court in Feeney . 227 In that case, the court examined the constitutionality of a state's statute which af orded veterans an advantage in employee hiring. More than 98 percent of veterans are men. T e law's ef ect, therefore, was discrimination against women in hiring. T e Supreme Court has held that, despite the discriminatory ef ect, the purpose of the law cannot be seen as discriminatory since there was never a discriminatory intent behind it. As Justice Stewart wrote:

> "Discriminatory purpose" implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences. It implies that the decisionmaker, in this case a state legislature, selected or reaf rmed a particular course of action at least in part "because of" not merely "in spite of," its adverse ef ects upon an identif able group. 228

ee. T e relevance of intent in free speech casesT e First Amendment right to freedom of expression has been comprehensively discusses by the US Supreme Court. 229 One of the basic distinctions drawn by the Court in this regard was that between a "content based" limitation on the freedom of expression, and a "content neutral" limitation. In the f rst case, when the limitation on the freedom of expression is related to the content of the speech, such as pornography, the limiting law is to be the subject of strict scrutiny. In the second case, when the limitation on freedom of expression is not related to the content of the speech – such as limitations on the time, place, and manner in which the speech is presented – then the limiting law would be the subject of intermediate, or at times minimal, scrutiny. T e second category also includes laws that may be considered content based, but that their purpose is to achieve legitimate social goals (such as protection of the public order). Accordingly, legislation seeking

<sup>227</sup> Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. Feeney , 442 US 256 (1979). 228 Ibid ., at 279. 229 See Tribe, above note 196, at 785. See also T. I. Emerson, T e System of Freedom of Expression (London: Vintage Books, 1970 ); F. Schauer, Free Speech: A Philosophical Enquiry ( 1982 ); H. Kalven, A Worthy Tradition: Freedom of Speech in America (Cambridge University Press, 1988 ); S. Shif rin, T e First Amendment, Democracy and Romance (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1990 ).

to prevent the screening of pornographic movies near schools or churches is constitutional: Despite being content based, the purpose of the law is to regulate the secondary ef ects of the expression and not to regulate the expression itself. 230

 How should we determine whether the law limits freedom of expression based on its content? T e US Supreme Court has distinguished between two sets of content based cases. In the f rst set of cases, the text of the legislative provision itself may teach us that the limitation of the freedom of expression is content based; these cases are termed facial content based. A law restricting the publication of pornographic materials falls well within that group. In the second set of cases, the text of the legislative provision in question is neutral; these cases are sometimes referred to as facial content neutral. Still, despite the facially neutral content, the purpose of the provision is still to limit freedom of expression due to the content of the expression itself. In both sets of cases, the legislative provision's purpose is controlling. In the f rst set of cases – facial content based – the purpose determines whether the law was primarily intended to limit the freedom of expression, or whether it was intended, instead, to regulate only the secondary ef ects of the expression. In the second set of cases – facial content neutral – the law's purpose determines whether it should be subject to strict scrutiny or to a lower level of scrutiny.

 Whenever the law is subject to strict scrutiny review, it would survive such review only if it can be shown that it was enacted to serve a compelling or substantial state interest, or to serve another pressing public need. In order to answer the question whether these purposes are fulf lled, the legislative intent of the law's creators is also examined. As Justice Powell has noted: "[A] law will not pass Constitutional master if the … purpose articulated by the legislature is merely a 'sham.'" 231 Tribe summarized the issue in the following way:

> In the f rst amendment context, the Supreme Court has been willing to inquire regarding – and to strike down executive and administrative actions on the basis of – what it determines to be improper motives or purposes. 232

- 230 See Chemerinsky, above note 216, at 937. 231 Wallace v. Jaf ree , 472 US 38, 64 (1985). 232 See Tribe, above note 196, at 816.
- 
- 

T is conclusion, however, is not free from doubt. T ere are many Supreme Court opinions – regarding both freedom of expression and other matters – that have ruled that the constitutionality of the legislative provision does not depend on the purpose or the motive behind its enactment. 233

### 3. T e correct solution for identifying the proper purpose

- i. Identifying the proper purpose: a subjective-objective test
T e basic premise before us is that a statutory provision limits a constitutional right. Such a provision is constitutional only if the limitation serves a proper purpose. T e dif erent standards used to determine what would constitute a proper purpose have already been discussed. T e discussion now turns to the sub-constitutional level. I ask the question whether the examination of proper purpose is made in accordance with a subjective criteria (the legislator's intent at the time of the enactment was to fulf ll those proper purposes), or in accordance with an objective criteria (the object of the statute, as it is interpreted by the judge at the time of the interpretation, was to fulf ll those proper purposes), or some combination of the two. In attempting to answer this question, it is important to note that we are not dealing with the question of "what is the meaning of the limiting law?" T e question is not interpretive in nature. 234 Rather, it asks whether the limiting law is proportional. T e question is constitutional in nature. T us, for example, it is certainly possible to deny consideration of the subjective purpose of the law in the context of its interpretation – taking into account only dynamic objective interpretation – while at the same time considering the subjective intent in the context of the law's constitutionality in order to determine the law's subjective purpose.

T e right approach should be based on a combined test, so that the purpose of the limiting legislation would be considered proper only if it satisf es both the subjective and the objective tests. 235 T is approach applies to all rights. Unlike American constitutional law, this approach does not distinguish between dif erent groups of rights. Rather a purpose is proper

<sup>233</sup> Ibid ., at 819. See also United States v. O'Brien , 391 US 367 (1968); E. Kagan, "Private Speech, Public Purpose: T e Role of Governmental Motive in First Amendment Doctrine," 63 U. Chi. L. Rev . 413 ( 1996 ). 234 See above, at 72. 235 See Pulido, above note 27, at 718. For a dif erent approach, see Rivers, above note 203,

at 196.

only if the legislator's intent at the time of the enactment was to fulf ll the proper purpose and that the objective purpose of the legislation at the time of its interpretation still fulf lls this proper purpose. Accordingly, if the legislative purpose – as it appears to the judge while deciding the constitutional issue – does not fulf ll a proper purpose, the law would be unconstitutional regardless of the fact that the legislator may have had a proper purpose in mind.

# ii. Reasons supporting the combined test

 At the foundation of my approach lies the notion that the requirements relating to proper purpose are aimed, f rst and foremost, at the creators of the limiting law. T e legislator should enact laws limiting constitutional rights only if such laws serve proper purposes. When the legislator is aware, therefore, that the law's objective is not proper, it should avoid its legislation altogether. T e legislator should not be able to rely on the hypothesis that, in the future, whenever such a law is brought before the court for constitutional review, the objective purpose gleaned from it would lead the court to conclude that it was enacted to serve a proper purpose. Indeed, a judicial recognition of such an "escape route" would release the legislator from the need to examine its own intentions, and may in fact incentivize the enactment of acts for improper purposes. T us, for example, a legislator wishing to enact laws with discriminatory ef ects would simply enact "facially content neutral" laws, and thus achieve its improper purposes. Such a legislative option should not be allowed. If we take the notion of proper purpose seriously, we should not allow improper purposes which merely appear (in disguise) as proper purposes while using a neutral language. T e truth behind the words should be exposed, and the legislator should be prevented from achieving any of its improper goals. As Tribe wrote, in the context of freedom of expression:

> If the f rst amendment requires an extraordinary justif cation of government action which is aimed at ideas or information that government does not like, the constitutional guarantee should not be avoidable by government action which seeks to attain that unconstitutional objective under some other guise. 235a

 Should the examination of the subjective intent suf ce? T e question arises in those instances where the legislator's initial (subjective) purpose has been proper. Why should we continue to examine, under these assumptions, the current (objective) purpose of the legislation? T e answer

235a See Tribe, above, note 196 at 84.

is that each examination serves a dif erent role. T e examination of the subjective intention at the time of the enactment is meant to prevent the legislation of a law that may limit a constitutional right in order to serve an improper purpose. T e examination of the purpose at the time of the interpretation is meant to ensure that the human rights in question are protected for the duration of the law's existence and not only at its birth. It is therefore insuf cient that the statute was created through proper intentions. T e same rule applies to all other components of proportionality, 236 and this is the appropriate solution here as well. T e approach is that the law should sustain the requirements of proportionality for the entire duration of its existence.

### iii. Reasons against the combined test

T ere are three main arguments against the combined test. First, a multi-member body such as a legislature does not have (and cannot form) "intent." Rather, intent can only be ascribed to humans, as in the examples of the intent of the draf er of a will, or the intent of a minister (or secretary) in promulgating regulations. Such intent cannot be ascribed to – and has no meaning in the context of – the legislative branch, where a multi-member body attempts to reach a settlement on a contentious policy issue. T e same argument – the missing "intent" of a legislative body – has also been raised in the interpretive context in addition to the constitutional context. T is argument cannot be accepted in the interpretive context 237 or in the constitutional context. T e task of identifying legislative intent is complicated. T e proposition that the personal motives of each member of the legislative body are not relevant for the inquiry is accepted; instead, it is the aggregate intention of the legislative body as a whole that matters. T at aggregate intention is the result of the negotiations conducted by the separate members, and the settlement it ref ects. It is that collective will that brought about the law. 238 Indeed, in a constitutional democracy with a proper political structure, the members of the legislative body, collectively, devise a purpose. 239 If they reach an agreement and if they constitute a majority, they would vote and enact

<sup>236</sup> See below, at 312 (regarding rational connection), at 331 (regarding necessity). 237 Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law , above note 195, at 132. 238 Ibid ., at 133. See also R. Dworkin, A Matter of Principle (Oxford University Press,

 <sup>1985 ), 48. 239</sup> See B. Bix, Law, Language, and Legal Determinacy (Oxford University Press, 1993 ), 183; K. Greenawalt, "Are Mental States Relevant for Statutory and Constitutional Interpretation?," 85 Cornell L. Rev . 1609 ( 2000 ).

a law which, in their opinion, is aimed at achieving that purpose. But such a purpose is identif able and can be compared to the proper purpose ascribed to the law. If the two are not congruent, we can conclude that the law was enacted to serve an improper purpose. T e refusal to accept the notion of legislative intent is much like a refusal to accept the notion of legislation at all. In many instances, the f nal legislative text is the product of long negotiations between members of the legislative body whose separate interests and motives are not always aligned with those of the act itself. But that is also precisely the reason why we should not search for those individual intents and motives when looking for the legislative intent. Despite this, getting from here to the conclusion that no legislative intention exists is a long road. T e law's intent is the purpose that the law was meant to serve, and for which the law has achieved the proper majority.

T e second argument against the combined test focuses on those laws that served, at the time of their enactment, an improper purpose, but may be now assigned with an (objective) proper purpose. In these types of laws, the argument goes, there is no point in examining the (subjective) legislative intent, since, even if the law is declared unconstitutional for that reason, the legislative body would be able to reenact it under the current (objective) purpose. T ere is no point, according to the argument, in declaring such a law as unconstitutional. 240 T e response is that such a declaration is useful on two levels. First, it is not certain that the current purpose would gain the required majority in the legislative body in order to reenact the law. Second, if the law was declared unconstitutional due to its improper purpose, such a determination may well deter members of the legislative body from reenacting the same law, for fear that the court may f nd that the same purpose still underlies the current law, despite the attempt to conceal it behind the new (and legitimate) purpose. 241

T e third and f nal argument against the combined test is based on the evidentiary issues arising from the attempt to present the intent of a multi-member body such as the legislator. According to this argument, even if – arguendo – we can theoretically ascribe an intention to such a multi-member body, the actual identif cation of this intent is near to impossible. I cannot agree with this argument. T ere are several ways by

which the intention of a multi-member body can be identif ed. 242 T e US Supreme Court did not face many dif culties when attempting to identify this intent regarding the strict scrutiny test, where legislative intent plays a major role. T us, for example, when the limited right in question was the right to equality before the law and the classif cation was "suspect" – that is, based on race (for example) – the courts concluded that the intention was discriminatory and therefore improper. 243 In addition, one can learn from the pre-legislative history, the legislative history, and the post-legislative history on the intent that was envisioned by the legislative body at the time the law was enacted. As Justice Powell wrote in Arlington Heights , which examined the ways in which such intent may be determined:

> Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available. T e impact of the of cial action – whether it "bears more heavily on one race than another" – … may provide an important starting point. Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the ef ect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face … T e evidentiary inquiry is then relatively easy. But such cases are rare … T e historical background of the decision is one evidentiary source, particularly if it reveals a series of of cial actions taken for invidious purposes … T e specif c sequence of events leading up to the challenged decision also may shed some light on the decision-maker's purposes … T e legislative or administrative history may be highly relevant, especially where there are contemporary statements by members of the decision-making body, minutes of its meetings, or reports. In some extraordinary instances the members might be called to the stand at trial to testify concerning the purpose of the of cial action, although even then such testimony frequently will be barred by privilege. 244

Naturally, the state can always present evidence to the contrary.

# Rational connection

# **A. Te nature of the rational connection test**

### 1. T e content of the rational connection test

 What is required by the rational connection (f t, geeignetheit , appropriateness, suitability) test? T e requirement is that the means used by the limiting law f t (or are rationally connected to) the purpose the limiting law was designed to fulf ll. T e requirement is that the means used by the limiting law can realize or advance the underlying purpose of that law; that the use of such means would rationally lead to the realization of the law's purpose. It is therefore required that the means chosen be pertinent to the realization of the purpose in the sense that the limiting law increases the likelihood of realizing its purpose. Accordingly, if the realization of the means does not contribute to the realization of the law's purpose, the use of such means would be disproportional. Consider the following examples:

- (a) According to legislation in both Canada and South Africa, when an individual is in possession of an illegal drug it is presumed that the possession is for the purpose of traf cking. Both the Supreme Court of Canada 1 and the Constitutional Court of South Africa 2 have ruled that there is no rational connection between the purpose of the "war on drugs" and the legislative determination that the mere possession of a small amount of an illegal drug may promote the war on drugs. 3 As the legislation disproportionally limited the constitutionally protected right to the presumption of innocence, both laws were held unconstitutional. In the Canadian case, Chief Justice Dickson has noted that there should be a rational connection
1 See R . v. Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103. 2

See S . v. Bhulwana , 1996 (1) SA 388. 3

For criticism of that approach, see below, at 306.

between the possession of the illegal drug and the presumption that the possession was with the intent to sell. 4 Such a rational connection does not exist when the amount in question is either very small or negligible.

- (b) In South Africa, the Constitutional Court examined a statute which established a presumption regarding unlawful weapons. According to the presumption, any person "present at or occupying" a premises "shall be presumed" to be in possession of the unlawful weapons found in the premises "until the contrary is proved." 5 T e Court held the law to be unconstitutional because it disproportionally limits the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence. In particular, the Court noted that there is no rational connection between the purpose of the struggle against the illegal possession of weapons and one's random presence at the location where such unlawful weapons were found
- (c) In South Africa, the Constitutional Court examined a statute which denied same-sex couples a number of benef ts af orded to married couples. T e Court ruled that the purpose of the law was proper, as it was meant to protect the traditional family structure. However, the Court ruled that there is no rational connection between that purpose and the means of denying the benef ts. 6
- (d) In Germany, a statute prescribed that in order to receive a hunting permit adequate knowledge of the use of firearms was required. It was argued that the law was unconstitutional as it relates to hunting with eagles. The German Constitutional Court held that the limitation on the constitutional freedom to develop one's personality is disproportional, as no rational connection exists between the law's purpose (guaranteeing the community's protection from hunting weapons) and the means used by the law – the requirement of technical knowledge of firearms regarding hunting with eagles – which is connected to an activity that has nothing to do with firearms. 7

### 2. T e nature of the rational connection

T e rational connection test does not require that the means chosen be the only ones capable of realizing the limiting law's purpose. 8 T ere is no requirement that one means and no other realize the proper purpose. T ere may be cases where several means are used – and all are considered as having a rational connection to the purpose. Take, for example, the regulation of the legal profession, which can be regulated in dif erent ways. One way is self-regulation; another is through a governmental agency. T e fact that several options exist does not render the selected means one without a rational connection.

T ere is no requirement that the means chosen fully realize the purpose. A partial realization of the purpose – provided that this realization is not marginal or negligible – satisf es the rational connection requirement. 9T erefore, the requirement is that the legislative means suf ciently advance the purpose limiting the constitutional right and that there be a f t between the means chosen and the proper purpose. 10

T e question raised by the rational connection test is not whether the means are proper and correct, or whether there are other, more proper and correct means; rather, the question is: are the means chosen by the limiting law capable of advancing the law's underlying purpose? 11 T us, whenever the means chosen do not advance the purpose – or have no ef ect on it – they have failed the rational connection test. In these cases, we may conclude that the legislator "missed its target." Of course, when the means chosen harm the purpose – instead of advancing it – these too will fail the test. However, there is no ef ciency requirement. In order to pass the rational connection test, the means can advance the purpose inef ciently. 12

- "Proportionality and Variable Intensity of Review," 65 Cambridge L. J . 174, 189 ( 2006 ). 10 In that sense, the requirement mimics that of the American "rational connection" test (which is used at the lowest level of constitutional scrutiny). See E. Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies , 3rd edn. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2006 ), 685; A. Stone Sweet and J. Mathews, "All T ings in Proportion?: American Rights Doctrine and the Problem of Balancing," Emory L. J . (forthcoming, 2011). 11 See Rivers, above note 9, at 197.
- 

<sup>8</sup> See N. Emiliou, T e Principle of Proportionality in European Law: A Comparative Study (London: Kluwer Law International, 1996 ), 28.

 With this is mind we can return to examine some of the aforementioned examples. 13 Take the statutory provision reversing the burden of proof in drug-possession cases. T is provision satisf es the rational connection test, if only in part, 14 since the probability that a person in possession of an illegal substance may be related to drug traf cking is not trivial. T e main dif culty with burden-reversing legislation has less to do with the test of rational connection and more to do with the other tests (which will be discussed in the following chapters). 15

### 3. Rational connection and the means "designed to achieve" the proper purpose

 In some cases, it was held that in order to satisfy the rational connection requirement the means chosen must be designed to achieve the purpose of the limiting law. As Chief Justice Dickson has noted in Oakes , the legislative means has to be "carefully designed to achieve the objective in question." 16 T is approach is correct if by "designation" we refer to the ability of the means to advance the purpose in question. T is approach is not correct, however, if by "designation" we mean the selection of the most adequate means – that is, a means that would neither over-expand nor over-restrict the limitation imposed by the law. 17 T at second meaning of "designation" is not related to the rational connection test, though it may lead to the conclusion that the purpose of the limiting law is not the one claimed by the state but rather a dif erent purpose. 18 In any event, this second meaning of "designation" is related to necessity 19 and proportionality stricto sensu20 tests, which will be discussed in the following chapters. Accordingly, it would be advisable, so as to avoid terminological confusion, not to use the term "designation" in relation to the rational connection test.

<sup>18</sup> See J. Kirk, "Constitutional Guarantees, Characterisation and the Concept of Proportionality," 21 Melb. U. L. Rev . 1, 4 ( 1997 ). 19 See below, at 317. 20 See below, at 340.

### 4. Rational connection and arbitrary means

 In Oakes , Chief Justice Dickson emphasized that "the measures adopted … must not be arbitrary, unfair, or based on irrational connections." 21 T is statement well ref ects the essence of the rational connection test if it relates to the requirement that the means adopted would be rational. T at said, it seems that the "fairness" requirement is not directly related to the rational connection test, or – in other words – that it should be considered at this point of the analysis. In theory, a means chosen by the limiting law may be unfair but still rationally connected to the purpose in question. T e fairness of the means is certainly important. An unfair means may limit the right to equality; an unfair means may not satisfy the proper purpose requirement; and it may also fail the other requirements imposed by proportionality. 22 Despite all that, an unfair means may rationally lead to the realization of the proper legislative purpose.

 A similar issue arises regarding the approach that an "arbitrary" means does not fulf ll the requirements of the rational connection test. T is is true in some cases, but is it always true? T e arbitrary nature of the means may indicate that the purpose is not proper. 23 It is possible that it may not pass proportionality's other tests. Still, this does not mean that, in every case in which arbitrary means are used, it fails to advance the proper purpose. A more thorough examination should be conducted as to the reasons for the arbitrariness, as well as its consequences. Certain aspects of the arbitrariness lead to the conclusion that no rational connection exists between the purpose and its realization. Other aspects might not necessarily lead to the same conclusion. Importantly, only those aspects of the arbitrary means that relate to their ability to advance the purpose in question are pertinent to the rational connection test. Other aspects of arbitrariness can be examined at other stages of the constitutional review of proportionality.

T e rational connection test is a factual test. It asks an empirical question regarding the ability of the means used by the limiting law to advance or realize the proper purpose. T us, the unfairness or arbitrariness of the test are irrelevant per se .

# **B. Te rational connection test and factual uncertainty**

### 1. T e problem of factual uncertainty

 Uncertainty is a well-known condition in the law. 24 It has many facets. One of these is the uncertainty frequently encountered regarding the probability of the means chosen to realize the purpose. In many cases, the means are chosen through prognosis and according to the probabilities regarding social, economic, and political developments. T e latter, however, hardly ever reach a level of certainty as to the issue of whether the means chosen would actually advance the purpose in question. Take, for example, the Israeli Supreme Court case of the Gaza Coast Regional Council . 25 Here, the Court examined the constitutionality of a law implementing the Israeli government's disengagement plan from the Gaza Strip. 26 T e law ordered the evacuation of all Jewish settlements and settlers from that area. As such, the law limited the constitutional rights of the Israeli settlers to human dignity, to property, and to freedom of occupation. T e settlers claimed that such a limitation is unconstitutional. In particular, it was argued that no rational connection exists between the evacuation and the security and national purposes prescribed by the law. T e majority opinion in that case phrased the issue in question as follows:

> Is there a rational connection between the policy, national, and security purposes underlying the Disengagement Act and the means chosen by that Act – namely the evacuation of Israeli settlers? According to the petitioners, the required rational connection does not exist. T ey claim that the plan would not advance the benef ts assumed to be gained by the Act, but rather would inf ict serious harm on each of the Act's goals. Are the petitioners correct? 27

 Further explaining the issue relating to the rational connection test, the majority noted:

> T e disagreement between the parties revolves around the probability of realizing the purposes underlying the disengagement plan. Regarding this complex issue, however, it seems that no one is arguing for complete

- 27 See Gaza Coast Regional Council , above note 25, at 572.

<sup>24</sup> See A. Vermeule, Judging under Uncertainty (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2006 ). 25 See HCJ 1661/05 Gaza Coast Regional Council v. Knesset of Israel [2005] IsrSC 59(2) 481. 26 Law of Implementing Disengagement Program (2005).

certainty. Rather, we are dealing with evaluations of policy, and national and security interests; these evaluations, in turn, depend on many external factors that cannot be controlled. T ese are a series of "polycentric" considerations – considerations without a single focal point but rather they are based on several variables and their varying ef ects. When approaching this type of considerations, it is impossible to determine a single probability standard, but rather to examine a series of variables. 28

 Is the lack of factual certainty suf cient to lead to the conclusion that no rational connection exists between the means and the purpose? Does the rational connection test require factual certainty? If not – what is the rational connection test's requirement?

### 2. T e certainty of the rational connection: rejection of extreme approaches

 One extreme approach is that the rational connection test should demand complete certainty in that the means chosen by the law lead to the realization of the proper purpose. T is approach provides maximum protection to all human rights. Still, it should not be adopted. 29 It does not suit the modern notion of the functions f lled by the political branches (the legislative and executive) in a constitutional democracy. T ese functions include the setting and implementation of social policy. T is is the case even if such policy contains elements of uncertainty. If complete certainty was required for the successful implementation of policy we would be unable to achieve most of the economic, security, social, and national objectives of the state. We should always remember that, while human rights are central to democracy, they are not democracy's only component. Alongside the recognition of human rights, we should recognize other proper interests that the political authorities seek to advance.

 Another extreme approach maintains that the rational connection test is satisf ed every time the political branches (legislative and executive) are of the opinion that such a connection exists. Admittedly, such an approach would enable the political branches to fulf ll their proper purposes. Still, this position should also not be adopted. It is not consistent with the place human rights occupy in a constitutional democracy. T is status indicates that human rights may not be limited based on mere speculations that are out of touch with reality, the result of which may be

<sup>28</sup> Ibid . 29 See Emiliou, above note 8, at 27. See also R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (Julian Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]), 417.

that of no contribution – or a marginal contribution, at best – of the means chosen to the realization of the proper purpose. And, while it is true that the will of the majority and its needs are central tenets in democracy, they are not its only tenet. Alongside the public interest are the individual's rights. Such rights may not be limited through mere speculations.

T e conclusion which arises from this analysis is that the rational connection test is not based on the notion that the means chosen realize the proper purpose in complete certainty. 30 However, a marginal contribution alone will not suf ce. 31

### 3. Determining the factual basis required for the existence of the rational connection

T e evaluation of the existence of a rational connection is based on the facts presented to the legislator and the legislator's evaluation based on those facts. T e evaluation is also based on the shared life-experience of a given society, as well as on the knowledge provided by science. 32 Mainly, the test is based on logic and common sense. As Justice Wilson has noted:

> T e Oakes inquiry into "rational connection" between objectives and means to attain them requires nothing more than showing that the legitimate and important goals of the legislature are logically furthered by the means government has chosen to adopt. 33

 At times, the text of the law is insuf cient in order to evaluate the likelihood of the existence of the rational connection. "Rationality requires facts, suitability needs data." 34 Regarding this situation, I have noted that:

> We are required to examine the social reality which the law sought to change. Typical to these cases is the realization that the evaluation of the rational connection, or the "f t," largely depends on future events. T ese are cases where various variables may af ect the actual f t of the means

chosen to the purpose in question, as well as the rational connection between them. T at f t, or rational connection, is then examined according to the results they may achieve in practice. 35

T e burden of proof is on the party arguing that there exists a rational connection. 36 When the state is the one defending the constitutionality of a legislative provision, it is required to present the factual foundation to the court on which the legislator based its evaluations. Obviously, the opposite party may present any factual foundation which appears proper to them. Based on the determined factual foundation, the court will examine the probability of realizing the proper purpose through the arrangements available in the law. Here, the court acknowledges the wide discretion granted to the legislator in these matters. As I have noted elsewhere:

> [T]he judge should beware of applying complex considerations of economic or social policy, which frequently are the subject of controversy, require expertise and information, and may necessitate assumptions and hypotheses that in turn require additional assumptions. T e safe and reasonable way will usually be to leave the matter to the legislature, which can obtain all the relevant information from experts and which can formulate a public policy that suits the issue in its entirety. 37

 As for the policy, economic, and security-based considerations at the foundation of the disengagement, the Israeli Supreme Court (majority opinion) has noted, in the Gaza Coast Regional Council case: 38

> In an issue such as the one before us, the Court should assume that both the legislative and executive branches have weighed the entire spectrum of probability considerations, while consulting experts in all relevant f elds available to them. T ese branches bear the national responsibility for these dif cult decisions. T is is their role in the triangle of the three branches of government. T ey, and not the courts, should decide on these issues. Of course, there will be exceptions – for example, when corruption is proved – where the courts will determine that national policy with such far-reaching implications, such as the disengagement plan, does not advance its purposes. 39

T e Gaza Coast Regional Council case is unique in terms of the wide discretion granted to the legislator. However, even in less extreme cases, the same principle should apply. Indeed, the legislator's discretion in determining its legislative prognosis is wide. 40 T e fact that at times there is a mistake is not suf cient to justify judicial reversal. However, the discretion is not absolute. Although complete certainty is not required for the legislative prognosis, mere speculation is also insuf cient. An appropriate factual foundation should be laid.

### 4. Rational connection and the test of time

 At what point in time is the rational connection tested? 41 When should a rational connection exist between the means chosen by the limiting law and its proper purpose? Should the connection occur at the time of enactment ( ex ante ) or at trial ( ex post )? Should the rational connection test requirement be satisf ed at both times?

T e examination of the rational connection should be continuous. 42 T ere is no determining point in time. Rather, every point of the limiting law's life is relevant; the rational connection must exist throughout the law's entire lifespan. T e issue of constitutionality accompanies the law throughout its existence. 43 Regarding the date of the law's enactment, the law must fulf ll the rational connection test – that is, the means determined by the limiting law, and which limit the constitutional right, should have a rational connection to the purpose the law was designed to achieve. T ere is no need to prove, with complete certainty, that the purpose of the law will actually be realized. All that is required is that the probability of realizing that purpose is not trivial, or theoretical. Such an examination is forward-looking ( ex ante ). T e requirement cannot be that the purpose be immediately realized with the law's enactment, or that the probability of its realization be clear at that point. Rather, the legislative prognosis should be examined as to its future evaluations. T us, even when the legislative purpose is not achieved upon enactment but it is assessed that it will be fulf lled at a time still pertinent to the law's existence, this is suff cient to establish that at that point in time the required rational connection exists. Conversely, if it is that the law's purpose will not be fulf lled

- 41 See Emiliou, above note 8, at 28.
- 42 See ibid ., at 27. For an ex ante approach, see Pulido, above note 9, at 731. 43 Regarding necessity, see below, at 331.
- 

<sup>40</sup> See below, at 405.

either at enactment or in the future, that is suf cient to rule out the existence of a rational connection. 44

 What should the result be when on enactment the law seems to have satisf ed the rational connection test, but later on during its constitutional examination ( ex post ) it turns out that it does not satisfy that requirement and that, in fact, there is no chance it would be relevant to the law's lifespan in the future? In this situation, the correct determination is that rational connection does not exist (from here on in). T e fact that at the time of the enactment an evaluation predicted that the existence of a rational connection does not render obsolete the need to examine whether that prediction is proved correct. If once again it turns out that there is no chance at fulf lling the law's purposes, one should conclude that no rational connection exists. Conversely, should the examination reveal that in the future it is still likely that the prediction be proved correct, we should refrain from the determination that no rational connection exists. Rather, this question can be reexamined in the future. Similarly, if during the examination it is resolved that the law cannot advance its own purposes – either now or at any relevant period in the future – then the court may determine that the law has failed the rational connection test.

 An example for this state of af airs was provided by the Israeli Supreme Court in the case of T e Movement for Quality in Government . 45 In Israel, a mandatory draf to the military is in ef ect for all 18-year-old men and women. T e Israeli Parliament enacted a law postponing military service for religious students who devote their life to study of the Torah. T e law contained a sunset provision, limiting its ef ect for f ve years. 46 T e Supreme Court examined the constitutionality of the law three years into its enactment. It was argued that the law limits the constitutional right to equality, and does not satisfy the requirements found in the limitation clause. T e majority opinion accepted the claim that the law limits the right to equality. Regarding the limitation clause, it was held that the purpose the law was meant to serve was proper. What about the other components of proportionality? T e Court reviewed the test of rational connection, and held:

> It should be examined whether the law satisf es the requirement of a rational connection (or "f t") between the integrated purposes of the law postponing military service and the means used for its fulf llment.

<sup>44</sup> See Emiliou, above note 8, at 26.

<sup>45</sup> See T e Movement for Quality Government in Israel , above note 35. 46 See Law to Postpone Service for Students Devoting T eir Life to Torah Study (2002).

Such an examination should be done, in this context, not as a theoretical exercise but as a practical matter, tested by its actual results. Indeed, as a theoretical question examined at the time of the law's enactment, it is possible that the legislative arrangements may bring about the desired results … But such an advanced examination ( ex ante ) is insuf cient. When the underlying purpose of the legislation is to lead to social change, which is not only a theoretical evaluation but rather is examined throughout the test of life, the f t between the means and ends should be examined through the results obtained … T e test of the service-postponement law is its actual fulf llment, the real social change achieved by the law. 47

 In its opinion, the Court examined the fulf llment of the law's purposes and concluded that, according to the results on the day of the trial, there was no rational connection between the law's purposes and the means chosen for their realization. It was held that "the law's purposes were realized but to a negligible degree." 48 However, the Court was of the opinion that not enough time had passed in order to fully examine the existence of a rational connection. I wrote in my judgment:

> T e law postponing military service deals with a fundamental problem in Israeli society, which cannot be resolved with a stroke of a pen. It deals with a sensitive topic, requiring tolerance and consensus. It seeks to provide solutions that are neither easy nor simple to implement. It was enacted, specif cally, as a temporary measure containing a sunset clause. T e legislature asked for time to examine the f t between the law's purposes and the means chosen to advance them. We are dealing with a complex social issue. A waiting period of f ve years falls well within the legislative discretionary purview. All these factors require us to withhold our conclusions. We have to provide the executioners of this law with the opportunity to f x what they broke. We should enable Israeli society as a whole, and the Haredi faction in particular, to internalize the legislative arrangements set up by the law as well as their intended implementation. All these considerations indicate that we should withhold our judgment for a period of f ve years from the date of the enactment of the law. By then, the legislator should have carefully reviewed the ways of its actual realization. In particular, the legislator would have to have examined whether the time that has passed since this decision was rendered has changed the legislative landscape signif cantly. 49

 Accordingly, the petition was denied; while the Court announced that, "although we have ruled today that the petitions are denied – as at this

point we cannot render a decision as to the law's constitutionality – we also hold that if the current trend continues and no signif cant change occurs in the state of af airs, there is concern that the postponement law will become unconstitutional." 50

## 5. Rational connection: a threshold test

T e rational connection component – much like the proper purpose component – is a threshold test. 51 It is not a balancing test. 52 It does not balance between the proper purpose and the limitation of the right. Rather, it rules out instances where a law limits a constitutional right without advancing the purposes it is designed to achieve. It is based on factual probabilities – and therefore is considered a factual test, of a negative nature. 53 T e rational connection test does not examine the relationship between the purpose and the limited constitutional right; rather, it deals with the relationship between the purpose in question and the means chosen to advance it. In other words, the probability question which the rational connection test is meant to deal with is the probability that the means used by the law fulf ll the public interest, which is at the foundation of the law. T e rational connection test was not designed, however, to provide an answer to the questions relating to the probability that if the means are used the constitutional right will be ef ected, or if the means are not used the public interest will be damaged.

# **C. Isthe rational connection test essential?**

 Is the rational connection test essential? Can we do without it? If the test only rules out the cases where no rational connection exists between the limiting means determined by law and its proper purpose, then there is no real need for it. 54 T e reason is that the necessity test – the lack of a lesser limiting alternative – can solve the same cases, since in this situation the lack of legislation would be considered a less limiting alternative. If there

is a need for legislation – that is, if there is no less limiting alternative (and the necessity test is satisf ed) – then in any case a rational connection exists. Either way, the rational connection test may also be considered part of the "necessity" requirement.

 It seems that the question of necessity of the rational connection test arises only regarding those cases where the means chosen by the limiting law do advance the law's purpose, but only to a very limited extent. In these cases the rational connection test stands on its own: through it we can examine whether the purpose presented as the legislative purpose is, indeed, the real purpose. 55 We will admit it is not that signif cant. Its entire purpose is to provide a quick solution in extreme cases where the incongruence between the means and the purpose is obvious, and by that to expedite the process of constitutional review. 56 Grimm was therefore right when he noted, in relation to the rational connection test, that "its function is to eliminate the small number of runaway cases." 57 Even this perhaps unimpressive contribution to the analytical process should not be discounted.

# Necessity

### **A. Characteristics of the necessity test**

### 1. T e content of the necessity test

 The next component of proportionality is the necessity test ( Erforderlichkeit ). It is also referred to as the requirement of "the less restrictive means." According to this test, the legislator has to choose – of all those means that may advance the purpose of the limiting law – that which would least limit the human right in question. T is test was discussed in the United Mizrahi Bank case:

> A statute limits a fundamental right to an extent no greater than is required only if the legislator has chosen – of all the available means – that which would least limit the protected human right. T e legislator, accordingly, should begin with the lowest "step" possible, and then proceed slowly upwards until reaching that point where the proper purpose is achieved without a limitation greater than is required of the human right in question. 1

T is test of proportionality is based on the premise that the use of the law's means – or the need to use such means – is required only if the purpose cannot be achieved through the use of other (hypothetical) legislative means that would equally satisfy the rational connection test and the level of their limitation of the right in question be lower. T e necessity for the means determined by law stems therefore from the fact that no other hypothetical alternative exists that would be less harmful to the right in question while equally advancing the law's purpose. If a less limiting alternative exists, able to fulf ll the law's purpose, then there is no need for the law. If a dif erent law will fulf ll the goal with less or no limitation of the human rights, then the legislator should choose this law. T e limiting

law should not limit the constitutional right beyond what is required to advance the proper purpose. Consider the following examples:

- (a) In Israel, a recent statute the Civil Torts Law (Liability of the State) 2005 2 – establishes, inter alia , that the State of Israel is not liable in torts for any damage caused by its security forces operating in conf ict areas. T is provision was meant to exclude the damages incurred during combat operations from the scope of regular tort law. T e Supreme Court has held 3 that the statute limits the constitutional right to which Basic Law: Human Dignity and Freedom applies, beyond what is necessary. T is is because it exempts from any liability in tort for damage incurred in a conf ict zone, even for those damages not caused by combat activities. T e Court recognized that the purpose of the law is proper, and that a rational connection exists between that purpose and the limiting statute; still, the necessity test could not be satisf ed. T e Court held that, in order to realize the statute's purpose, the legislator could have opted for a less limiting limitation of the constitutional right so as to provide the state with an exemption from tort liability for combat activities. T e measure adopted by the legislator limits the constitutional right beyond what is necessary, as it exempts the state from any damage incurred in a conf ict zone, including that caused by non-combat activities.
- (b) In Israel, a statutory provision included in the Regulation of Investment Advice, Investment Marketing and Investment Portfolio Management Law, 1995, 4 required a license to manage investment portfolios. T e requirement was applied retroactively to anyone who managed investment portfolios prior to the enactment of the statute. T e license requirement included a mandatory test, applicable to anyone who had managed investment portfolios for less than seven years prior to the statute's coming into force. T e Supreme Court held that this statute limited the constitutionally protected right of freedom of occupation of the veteran portfolio managers and that the limitation was for a proper purpose and satisf ed the rational connection test. Still, the transitional provisions regarding the mandatory test for veteran managers failed to pass the necessity test. T e Court ruled that

the law's purpose could have been fulf lled while limiting the veteran portfolio managers' right to a much lesser extent, while taking into account their accumulated experience. 5

- (c) In the Makwanyane6 case, the South African Constitutional Court examined the constitutionality of a statute recognizing the death penalty. T e Court held the statute to be unconstitutional since it was disproportional. T e Court held, inter alia , that the state failed to lif its burden in proving that the statute's purposes could not be achieved through a life sentence, which limits the constitutional right to life to a lesser extent.
- (d) In South Africa, in the Manamela case, 7 the Constitutional Court examined a statute establishing a reverse onus in cases relating to the acquisition of stolen goods. In particular, the statute provided that anyone accused of acquiring stolen goods should bear the burden of proving that the goods were not stolen. T e Court held that the purpose of the law – the protection of the community from dealing with stolen goods – was proper. Regarding the means used, it was ruled that the necessity test was not fulf lled as its purposes could have been achieved through a less limiting measure, such as limiting the scope to a particular category of high-value property.
- (e) In Germany, food regulations prohibited the sale of certain candies that contained cocoa powder which were primarily made out of rice. T ose regulations limited the constitutionally protected right of freedom of occupation of several candy manufacturers. T e purpose of the regulation was to protect consumers from a mistaken purchase. T e Constitutional Court held that the purpose was proper, and that a rational connection existed between that purpose and the limiting law. Still, the Court held that the means chosen by the legislator were disproportionate in that they were not necessary. T e same purpose could have been achieved through a warning label on the product; a complete prohibition of its sale was therefore unnecessary. T e alternative means – proper labeling – is equal in ef ciency to the means chosen by the legislator in achieving the proper purpose, but the harm that such a measure would cause to the constitutional right would be of a much lesser extent. 8

### 2. T e nature of the necessity test

T e necessity test is based upon the assumption that the law's purpose is a proper one. T us, while examining the requirements of necessity, there is no room for an examination of the constitutionality of the law's purpose. Similarly, there is no room to question the wisdom behind establishing that purpose, or the very need to establish it. T e necessity test relates to the means chosen by the legislator to achieve the purposes and not to the need to achieve those purposes. We assume that the means chosen by the legislator is a rational one; if the means chosen is irrational, there is no necessity in it. 9 T e requirement established by the necessity test, therefore, is that, in order to achieve the law's purpose, rational means should be chosen such that the intensity of the realization is no less than that of the limiting law, 10 and those means limit the constitutional right to the lesser extent. 11

T e main point of the necessity test – which is an expression of the notion of ef ciency, or, more specif cally, of Pareto ef ciency 12 – is that the law's purpose can be achieved through hypothetical means whose

- Centro de Estudios Pol í ticos y Constitucionales, 2007 ), 737. 11 See N. Emiliou, T e Principle of Proportionality in European Law: A Comparative Study (London: Kluwer Law International, 1996 ), 30, 21: "T e judicial standard against which a public measure is tested, is whether it could be substituted by another means which is 'milder' but 'equally ef ective' in achieving the ends pursued. 'Milder' is the measure which causes the least possible adverse repercussions on the legal status of the party concerned. A measure can be considered as 'equally ef ective' when it is suitable to achieve actually and with, at least, equal intensity the desired end." See also J. Rivers, "Proportionality and Variable Intensity of Review," 65 Cambridge L. J . 174, 198 ( 2006 ): "T e test of necessity asks whether the decision, rule or policy limits the relevant right in the least intrusive way compatible with achieving the given level of realisation of the legitimate aim. T is implies a comparison with alternative hypothetical acts (decisions, rules, policies, etc.) which may
- achieve the same aim to the same degree but with less cost to rights." 12 See Rivers: above note 11, at 198: "T e test of necessity thus expresses the idea of ef ciency or Pareto-optimality. A distribution is ef cient or Pareto-optimal if no other distribution could make at least one person better of without making any one else worse of . Likewise an act is necessary if no alternative act could make the victim better of in terms of right-enjoyment without reducing the level of realisation of some other constitutional interest." See also R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]), 105, 398; D. M. Beatty, T e Ultimate Rule of Law (Oxford University Press, 2004 ), 110. Regarding the Pareto ef ciency test, see R. Cooter and T. Ulen, Law and Economics , 4th edn. (Reading, MA: Addison Wesley, 2003 ). For an analysis of the approach according to Pareto's necessity test, see Pulido, above note 10, at 737.

limitation of the protected right would be to a lesser extent. Accordingly, the necessity test does not require the use of means whose limitation is the smallest, or even of a lesser extent, if the means cannot achieve the proper purpose to the same extent as the means chosen by the law. T e necessity test does not require a minimal limitation of the constitutional right; it only requires the smallest limitation required to achieve the law's purpose. At times, even the "smallest" limitation may be harsh. Indeed, the necessity test compares two rational means that equally realize the law's purpose. In this situation, the legislature should select the means whose limitation of the constitutional right is smallest. T e necessity test is triggered only when the fulf llment of the purpose is possible through the use of several alternative rational means, each of which limits the constitutional right to a dif erent extent. In this situation, the necessity test demands that the legislator choose the means which limit the constitutional right to the least extent. 13 In order to properly answer the question of whether the alternative means – which limit the right to a lesser extent – equally advance the purpose as the means chosen by the legislator, an understanding of both the purpose and the probability of its being achieved through the alternative means is necessary. An estimate is insuff cient; the understanding should be of the concrete factual data, as well as of the probabilities and risks involved.

 In Adalah , the Israeli Supreme Court reviewed the constitutionality of the Law of Citizenship and Entry into Israel (Temporary Measure) 2003, which, inter alia , established a blanket restriction on the unif cation of families where one of the spouses was Israeli and the other was a resident of either the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. T e purpose of the statute was to protect national security interests; it was demonstrated to the Court that, on twenty-six occasions, the spouse who entered Israel from the Occupied Territories through the process of family unif cation assisted in the execution of a terrorist act. T e Court held that the statute limited the Israeli spouse's constitutionally protected right to human dignity. T e Court also held that the purpose of the statute was proper, and that the means chosen were suited to achieving that purpose. Was the necessity test met in this case? T e petitioners argued that the proper purpose can be achieved through less limiting means – for example, an individual

<sup>13</sup> See RJR-MacDonald Inc . v. Canada (Attorney General) [1995] 3 SCR 199, § 96: "T e minimal impairment requirement does not impose an obligation on the government to employ the least intrusive measures available. Rather, it only requires it to demonstrate that the measures employed were the least intrusive, in light of both the legislative objective and the infringed right."

review of each resident of the Occupied Territories who requests family unif cation with their Israeli spouse. T e majority rejected the argument, holding that the blanket restriction satisf ed the necessity test:

> We have seen that the law's objective was to reduce, as much as possible, the threat created by the foreign spouses arriving in Israel. With this understanding of the law's purpose, can we conclude that the individual review and the blanket restriction advance that purpose equally? In order to answer this question we should compare the blanket restriction, as is, and the most comprehensive process of individual review possible. However, a process of individual review could never achieve the degree of security achieved by a blanket restriction. Accordingly, in light of the fundamental value of human life that the law is meant to protect, it is clear that the blanket restriction will always be more ef cient – from the standpoint of reducing the security threat to the lowest level possible – than the individual review. Our conclusion, therefore, is that, in the circumstances before us, the individual review does not fulf ll the legislative purpose to the same extent as the blanket restriction. T erefore, there is no requirement in the framework of the less limiting means, to stop at this level and the legislator was allowed to choose the blanket restriction as it did. 14

T is principle is well illustrated in the case of Cotroni . 15T ere, the Supreme Court of Canada examined the constitutionality of a statute which determined the rules of extradition. According to the said law, Canadian citizens could be extradited. It was claimed that this statute was unconstitutional. It was agreed that the statute limited the constitutional right of Canadian citizens to remain in Canada. T e question arose whether extradition meets the requirements of the Canadian limitation clause. T e Court held that the law fulf lls the purpose requirements. T e Court was divided, however, as to the requirement of the existence of less limiting means. T e petitioners argued that, under the circumstances at hand – a Canadian conspiracy to distribute illegal drugs in the United States – less limiting means existed, namely, an indictment against the Canadian citizens in Canada. T e majority opinion, however, written by Justice La Forest, held that, while it is true that this means limits the constitutional right to a lesser degree, it cannot fulf ll the purposes of the extradition. T e use of this means would raise evidentiary problems and therefore may weaken the war on illegal drugs and international co-operation. T e

Minister of Interior (May 14, 2006, unpublished), available in English at http://elyon1.court.gov.il/ f leseng/03/520 /070/a47/03070520. a47.pdf, para. 89 (Barak, P.). 15 See United States of America v. Cotroni [1989] 1 SCR 1469.

dissenting opinion, written by Justices Wilson and Sopinka, emphasized that, since the criminal conspiracy took place in Canada, it was possible to f le the indictment in Canada.

T e majority opinion was correct in this case. T e alternative means that would limit the right to a lesser extent – the indictment in Canada – could not have advanced the law's purposes to the same extent as the more limiting means (extradition). Still, it is possible that the harm incurred by the constitutional right by using the legislative means is disproportionate to the benef t to the public interest caused by the use of alternative means. T is is a serious question, but its examination is part of the next stage of the constitutional review – proportionality stricto sensu . 16

### 3. T e elements of the necessity test

### i. T e two elements of the necessity test

T e necessity test includes two elements. 17 T e f rst is the existence of hypothetical alternative means that can advance the purpose of the limiting law as well as, or better than, the means used by the limiting law; the second is that the hypothetical alternative means limit the constitutional right to a lesser extent than the means used by the limiting statute. If these two requirements are satisf ed, we can conclude that there is no necessity in the limiting law. However, if a hypothetical alternative means that equally advances the law's purpose does not exist, or if this alternative means exists but its limitation of the constitutional right is no less than that of the limiting law, then we can conclude that the limiting law itself is necessary. T e necessity test is met. Each of these elements will be examined separately.

### ii. T e f rst element: the existence of a hypothetical alternative means which equally advances the law's purpose

**a. Te nature of the frst element** T e f rst element of the necessity test examines the question of whether alternative means can fulf ll the law's purpose at the same level of intensity and ef ciency as the means determined by the limiting law. If such an alternative does not exist, the law is necessary and the necessity test is met. 18 An alternative exists only

<sup>16</sup> Regarding that test, see below, at 340.

<sup>17</sup> See Pulido, above note 10, at 738.

<sup>18</sup> See J. Cianciardo, "T e Principle of Proportionality: T e Challenges of Human Rights," 3 J. Civ. L. Stud . 177 ( 2010 ), 179.

if the (hypothetical) means would advance the law's purpose at the same level of intensity as those determined in the limiting law. It is therefore required that the alternative means fulf ll the law's purpose quantitatively, qualitatively, and probability-wise – equally to the means determined by the limiting law itself. 19

### **b. Te necessity test and external considerations**

aa. T e necessity test paradigm T e necessity test presupposes both a law's given purpose and a given limitation of the constitutional right through the means that the law determines. Based on these two assumptions, the necessity test determines that, if alternative means can be used to achieve the law's purpose while imposing a lesser limitation on the constitutional right, those less limiting means should be used. T us, the necessity test functions within the framework of the law's purposes and not by virtue of other purposes.

T e same is true regarding the means. T e necessity test examines the question of whether the law's purpose can be fulf lled through means which limit the constitutional right less – but no more. T e necessity test assumes that the less limiting means has an identical ef ect to that chosen by the law in every respect. Accordingly, the necessity test is not met when the law's purpose can be fulf lled through means whose limitation of the constitutional right is lesser, but requires additional limitations or expenses. T ose cases are discussed within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu . 20

bb. Ef ect on factors external to the limited rightA limiting law is necessary when the use of less limiting means will lead to a limitation of other rights which were not limited by the means set out in the law. 21 Similarly, the limiting law is necessary whenever the cost of the decrease in the limitation of the constitutional right must be borne by a new policy that the state does not favor, or is f nanced by a budget designed to advance other purposes. T e limiting law is unnecessary only in cases where the fulf llment of the law's purpose is achieved through less limiting means, when all the other parameters remain unchanged. T e necessity test cannot be used as a pretext for selecting a less limiting measure when the latter would lead to an expenditure of state funds, a re-ordering of the national budgetary priorities, or to further limitations on other rights of the same

<sup>19</sup> Pulido, above note 10, at 740. 20 See below, at 340. 21 See H. Dreier, GG Grundgesetz Kommentar (T ü bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2006 ), 259.

person or of the rights of others. Writing for the dissent in the Manamela case, 22 Justices O'Regan and Cameron of the Constitutional Court of South Africa have similarly noted:

> T e problem for the Court is to give meaning and ef ect to the factor of less restrictive means without unduly narrowing the range of policy choices available to the Legislature in a specif c area. T e Legislature when it chooses a particular provision does so not only with regard to constitutional rights, but also in the light of concerns relating to costs, practical implementation, the prioritisation of certain social demands and needs and the need to reconcile conf icting interests. T e Constitution entrusts the task of legislation to the Legislature because it is the appropriate institution to make these dif cult policy choices. When a Court seeks to attribute weight to the factor of "less restrictive means" it should take care to avoid a result that annihilates the range of choice available to the Legislature. 23

T e majority in this case – Justices Madala, Sachs, and Yacoob – also adopted the same view:

> T e duty of a court is to decide whether or not the legislature has overreached itself in responding, as it must, to matters of great social concern. As the minority judgment points out, when giving appropriate ef ect to the factor of "less restrictive means," the court must not limit the range of legitimate legislative choice in a specif c area. T e minority judgment also states that such legislative choice is inf uenced by considerations of cost, implementation, priorities of social demands, and the need to reconcile conf icting interests. T ese are manifestly sensible considerations that do not provoke disagreement. 24

T e necessity test is based on the assumption that the only change that should be brought about by the alternative means is that the limitation on the constitutional right would be of a lesser extent. T e rest of the conditions as well as the rest of the operational results should not be altered. T us, the goal advanced by the lesser limiting means should be the same goal at the foundation of the law's limitation. T e f nancial means dedicated to the advancement of that proper purpose should not increase. T e rights limited by the alternative means should be the same rights the original law limited, while the extent of the limitation is diminished.

 What happens when these assumptions are not met? What if the reduction in the limitation of the constitutional right entails a limitation on other human rights of the same person, or a limitation on the rights of

22 See Manamela , above note 7. 23 Ibid ., at 95. 24 Ibid ., at 43.

others not limited by the original arrangement? T e answer to these questions is that they are not controlled by the framework of the necessity test, but rather within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu . 25

 If the purpose of the limiting law can be achieved while reducing the limitation on a constitutional right without additional expenses, one should conclude that the law is not necessary. But, whenever the new means, whose limitation of the constitutional right is of a lesser extent, require additional expense, we can no longer conclude that the means originally chosen are not necessary. T ey are necessary to achieving the law's purpose through the means provided by the legislator, and in order to prevent any additional expense. True, this leads to the further limitation of the human right, a limitation that could have been prevented were the state willing to accommodate the additional expense. But the state refuses. T e issue, therefore, is whether the state's choice of avoiding the additional expense in order to prevent the further limitation of a human right is constitutional. T e necessity test cannot assist us in attempting to resolve this issue; indeed, this discussion should be conducted within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu , which is based on balancing. T e saying "human rights cost money" 26 – which highlights the need to protect human rights even if this entails a f nancial burden – is not meant to refer to the necessity test. It is part of the balancing considerations which apply within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu .

- iii. T e second element: the hypothetical alternative means which limits the constitutional right to a lesser extent
**a. Te nature of the second element** T e second element of the necessity test examines the question of whether the hypothetical alternative limits the constitutional right to a lesser extent than the limiting law. In order to examine the second element, we should compare the ef ect of the limiting law on the constitutional right in question and the ef ect of the hypothetical alternative on the same right. T e requirement is that the alternative means limit that right to a lesser extent. T is extent is determined, among others, by examining the scope of the limitation, its ef ect, its duration, and the likelihood of its occurrence. Such a comparison may lead to a simple conclusion where each component of the alternative limitation limits the right less than the original law. But what happens when by comparison it becomes clear that in a number of parameters it limits

- 25 See Alexy, above note 12, at 400.
- 26 See below, at 340.

the constitutional right more than the original limiting law and in other parameters it limits the constitutional right less? In these cases, we cannot say that the alternative limits the constitutional right in question to a lesser extent. T e result, therefore, is that the law is considered necessary and the necessity test is met. T e decision will be made in the framework of proportionality stricto sensu .

 **b. "Limitation to a lesser extent": an objective test** How can we determine whether the means chosen by the legislator is the less limiting one? Should the test be of a subjective or an objective nature? T e test for determining the constitutionality of the law – as compared to the question of its application to a specif c case – must be objective. T e comparison must be between two types of limitation of the right as viewed by a typical right-holder. Any special circumstances, unique to the right-holder who brought the case before the court, should play no role in the determination of the issue of the "lesser extent." 27 Personal circumstances should not be a factor in determining the constitutionality of a legislative act. Rather, this determination must be based upon objective observations of a typical right-holder. However, the right-holder's personal information may af ect the legality of any sub-statutory state action, such as warrants and administrative actions made by virtue of the law in question.

T e objective test is determined, largely, by the standard of common sense. According to this standard, a blanket restriction on a random freedom (such as freedom of occupation) would constitute a greater limitation on that right than a partial restriction on the use of that right. T erefore, the requirement to close a business during certain hours would constitute less of a limitation than the requirement to shut down that same business completely. A requirement to properly label a product so that it is clear that it is dangerous for consumption constitutes less of a limitation (on the protected right to freedom of occupation) than imposing a complete restriction on the sale of the same product. T e application of the objective test is relatively clear in those instances where the means in question can be found on the same logical spectrum – from the lighter to the harsher limitation on the right. 28 As such, a life imprisonment sentence limits the right to life less than a death penalty, and a f ve-year sentence constitutes less of a limitation than a ten-year sentence on that same right. Imposing

<sup>27</sup> See Emiliou, above note 11, at 31.

<sup>28</sup> Ibid ., at 30. See also P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada , 5th edn., vol. II (Toronto: T omson Carswell, 2007), 146.

a limitation which applies to only part of a country's territory is less of a limitation than an imposition of the limitation obligation on the entire country. A short-term limitation is less limiting than a long-term limitation. A limitation that applies only to some individuals is less limiting than a limitation applicable to all. T ese are the easy cases; the application of the objective test becomes much harder when there is no clear logical spectrum.

T e answer to the objective question – of whether the limitation imposed by the alternative means is of a lesser extent – is a determination of law (rather than fact). It is for the court to provide. 29 T e legislator's belief that the limitation of the means chosen by the constitutional right is of a lesser extent than the limitation of a dif erent means is not determinative. T e court, in making its determination as to the objective question, should refrain from considering trivial ( de minimis ) 30 dif erences between the means. Whenever the court reaches a conclusion that a number of alternatives – including that determined by the law – satisfy the need to limit the constitutional right in a less restrictive fashion, it should leave the legislative choice intact. 31 However, that choice will be examined further on in the framework of the next stage of the examination – that of proportionality stricto sensu .

**c. Complete restriction versus individual examination** T e limitation of a constitutional right is of a lesser extent if it requires an individual examination of the right-holder instead of a blanket restriction of the right's realization. 32 T erefore, acceptance into the police force on the basis of an individual examination would limit the constitutionally protected right to freedom of occupation less than a complete restriction on anyone who is over the age of thirty-f ve to do the same. In the same vein, it was held that an individual examination of prisoners' mail – based on specif c security alerts – limits their right to privacy less than a general provision requiring an examination of all mail received

by prisoners. 33 Also, a general individual examination is more limiting than an individual examination based on advanced information or some sort of categorization. Under this approach, revoking one's passport based on an individual security check limits the person's right to travel less than a total ban which prevents the granting of passports. T e same is true in cases where an exception is determined to the complete restriction at issue. T us, a total ban fails the necessity test if an individual examination fulf lls the law's purpose to the same extent as a total ban. T e same is not true if the individual examination does not fulf ll the law's purpose to the same extent. Consider the following examples:

- (a) A provision of the Canadian Criminal Code provided that, in cases of sexual assault, "if application is made by the complainant," the court "shall" grant an order directing that her identity (or any information that could disclose it) should not be published. T e Supreme Court held that such a provision limits the constitutionally protected right to freedom of expression. 34 T e Court examined whether the provision is proportional. It was argued, in the context of the necessity test, that alternative means – based on an individual examination by the court in each case rather than a complete ban on publication – would limit the right to a lesser extent. T e argument was rejected. T e Court held that the law's purpose was to encourage complainants to come forward and turn to the police while providing them with complete protection from the potential trauma of public exposure. Only a total ban, the Court held, can accomplish such a goal. T e granting of judicial discretion to the court reviewing such matters – although limiting the right to a lesser extent – would not accomplish that purpose, since complainants may then fear that the court will order that their identity be disclosed. As Justice Lamer has noted: "[A] discretionary provision under which the judge retains the power to decide whether to grant or refuse the ban on publication would be counterproductive, since it would deprive the victim of that certainty. Assuming that there would be a lesser impairment of freedom of the press if the impugned provision were limited to a discretionary power, it is clear, in my view, that such a measure would not, however, achieve Parliament's objective, but rather defeats it." 35

- (b) A South African statute prohibited corporal punishments in schools. Parents of children petitioned the Constitutional Court claiming the statute violated their religious freedoms as they had consented to such punishments, which were in line with their religious beliefs. T e Court held that recognizing a new consent exception to the existing statutory ban would damage the law's policy, which was to unify educational methods throughout the country. T e Court further held that creating a constitutionally compelled exception, as requested by the parent-petitioners, would not only hinder the advancement of the statute's purpose but would actually operate directly against it. 36
- (c) In South Africa, a provision of the Drugs and Drug Traf cking Act 140 of 1992 prohibited the use and possession of dangerous drugs, including cannabis. T e ban included an exception for medical uses. T e Constitutional Court examined whether a religious exception should be determined as well. 37T e petitioner in that case had wanted to become a lawyer, but his request was declined by the local law society due to two prior convictions for cannabis use. However, all parties agreed that the petitioner was in possession of the drug for religious reasons (the petitioner is a Rastafarian). He argued that the law in question limits his religious rights disproportionally: the disproportionality stemmed from the lack of an exception to the criminal ban regarding the possession and use of dangerous drugs for religious reasons. T e justices had all agreed on the fact that the criminal ban has a proper purpose in the battle against drugs. It was also agreed that the ban limits the petitioner's freedom of religion. T e question was whether the absolute ban went too far in restricting the religious freedoms of the petitioner. T e justices were divided over whether such an exception would undermine the proper purpose of the prohibition (the prevention of illegal drug use). T e majority held that this purpose could not be achieved through the establishment of the additional exception, since it would be virtually impossible in each case to review whether the user was actually a member of the Rastafari religion and, if so, whether the use was for religious purposes. T e Court further held that without a proper licensing mechanism – unattainable in this case due to the structure of the religion and the lack of recognized institutions – it would not be possible to distinguish between the "island" of Rastafari use and the "ocean" of

use in general. T e majority was correct regarding the necessity test. A dif erent issue is whether the complete ban is proportional according to proportionality stricto sensu .

 **d. Te necessity test and the test of time** T e rational connection requirement must be met both during the enactment of the limiting statute ( ex ante ) and during the constitutional review ( ex post ). 38 Should the same requirement apply to the necessity test? T e answer is yes. T erefore, the necessity test must be satisf ed during enactment as well as during a constitutional review of the limiting law by the courts. 39 T e reason for this approach stems from the understanding that a limitation on the right in question is maintained throughout the law's life. T e justif cation for limiting a constitutional right should be continuous rather than momentary. T us, for example, if a technological breakthrough following the enactment of the limiting statute enables the advancement of its purpose at the same level of intensity but with a lesser limitation of the right, the legislator should take advantage of the advancement. A statute may otherwise lose its constitutionality, since it is no longer necessary.

### 4. T e necessity test and the purpose's level of abstraction

T e necessity test examines the means the law uses to fulf ll its purpose. It is required that the means both advance the law's purpose and limit the right in question less. From that premise we may infer the close relationship between the necessity test and the law's purpose. T e necessity test focuses on the purpose and the ways in which it may be fulf lled. T is focus leads to dif culties when the law has several purposes. T ese purposes may be at the same level of abstraction, or at several levels of abstraction. In both cases, the degree of necessity of the means chosen is derived from the manner in which the purpose is determined. 40

 An example may be the Manamela case, 41 decided by the Constitutional Court of South Africa. Here, the Court reviewed a statute establishing a reverse onus of proof in matters regarding stolen goods. T e Court was divided. T e majority held that the law was unconstitutional since it did

<sup>38</sup> See above, at 312.

<sup>39</sup> Regarding the requirement that the test is ex ante , see Pulido, above note 10, at 734. 40 See S. Woolman and H. Botha, "Limitations," in S.Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa , 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 87. 41 See Manamela , above note 7.

not meet the necessity requirement. T e dissent was of the opinion that the necessity test was met. Commenting on this division, Woolman and Botha 42 explained that this disagreement was caused by adopting a dif erent understanding of the statute's purpose. T e majority adopted a view of the statutory purpose at a high level of abstraction – the statute was meant to create tools to limit the market in stolen goods. Based on this purpose, it was held that the same purpose may be achieved through the use of less limiting means, such that the reverse-onus presumption would apply only in cases of high-value stolen goods. 43 T e dissent, in contrast, viewed the purpose as a warning to the public not to partake in any activity related to the market in stolen goods. In order to fulf ll that purpose there was a need to adopt the means chosen by the legislator – a less limiting means would not be able to fulf ll that goal.

 With this in mind, it is possible to conclude that the higher the purpose's level of abstraction, the more likely it is to f nd alternative means which limit the right to a lesser extent and which can fulf ll the goal at the same level of ef ciency. In contrast, the lower the level of abstraction, the harder it would be to render the means chosen by the legislator unnecessary. 44 In addition, a lower level of abstraction may raise dif cult questions regarding the test of proportionality stricto sensu . T is can be demonstrated through the Israeli Supreme Court case of Adalah . 45 Here, the legislator imposed a complete restriction on the unif cation of families in which one spouse resided in Israel and the other was a resident of the Occupied Territories. T e reason for the total restriction was grounded in national security considerations. Among others, the Court examined the question of whether an individual examination of the security risk – rather than a blanket restriction – would equally advance the law's security purpose while limiting the right to family life to a lesser extent. In order to solve this question, the Court f rst had to determine the statute's purpose. In my opinion, I noted that the statute's purpose was "to reduce, as much as possible, the security risk posed by foreign spouses who choose to settle

- 44 See P. W. Hogg, "Section 1 Revisited" 1 National Journal of Constitutional Law 1, 5 ( 1992 ): "If the objective has been stated at a high level of generality, it will be easy to think of other ways in which the wide objective could be accomplished with less interference with the [fundamental] right. If the objective has been stated at a low level of generality, perhaps simply restating the terms of the challenged law, it will be hard to think of other ways in which the narrow objective could be accomplished with less interference with the

<sup>…</sup> right." See also Woolman and Botha, above note 40, at 87. 45 Adalah v. Minister of Interior , above note 14.

#### Necessity 333

down in Israel." 46 Having determined the statute's purpose in this manner, I concluded that the individual examination could not have advanced that purpose at the same level of intensity as the means chosen by the legislator – a complete ban on family unif cation. I then considered the possibility that the statute's purpose was not to reduce the security risk "as much as possible," but rather to reduce that risk only "somewhat." 47 With that as the provision's purpose, the alternative means – the individual examination – would suf ce. I went on to determine which of those was the purpose designated by the statute, and I concluded that that purpose was to reduce the security risk "as much as possible." Accordingly, I concluded that the law satisf ed the necessity test. I then moved on to examine whether this actual purpose ("as much as possible") satisf ed the test of proportionality stricto sensu . 48

T is example indicates another conclusion pertinent to the necessity test. T e level of abstraction in which the law's purpose should be examined – whether the law has one purpose or several purposes at the same level of abstraction – should be determined in accordance with the actual (real) purpose which underlies the law. 49 T e question is not whether we can theoretically attribute a certain purpose to the law, but rather what was the actual purpose designated by the law. T e court does not choose the law's purpose. T e court, however, may examine the constitutionality of the means chosen by the law to achieve that purpose. When the law has several purposes, such an examination would be carried out in respect of the law's predominant purpose.

### **B. Means "narrowly tailored" to fulfll the law's purpose**

### 1. T e metaphors of the cannon and the sparrows

T e necessity test requires that the means chosen be "narrowly tailored" to achieve the law's purpose. T is notion was already expressed in 1911 by Fritz Fleiner, who famously wrote that the "police cannot shoot a sparrow with a canon" ("polizie soll nicht mit Kanonen auf Spatzen schießen"). 50 Lord Diplock used a similar metaphor when he noted, in one of his cases, that one "must not use a steam hammer to crack a nut." 51 T e Israeli

<sup>46</sup> Ibid ., para. 89 (Barak, P.). 47 Ibid ., para. 90 (Barak, P.). 48 See below, at 340. 49 See above, at 331. 50 F. Fleiner, Institutionen des Deutschen Verwaltungsrechts (T ü bingen, 1928 ), 404. 51 R . v. Goldstein [1983] 1 WLR 151, 155. Regarding this metaphor, see G. Wong, "Towards the Nutcracker Principle: Reconsidering the Objections to Proportionality," PL 92 ( 2000 ).

Supreme Court, in one of its opinions, repeated this metaphor, albeit slightly dif erently, when it asked whether "the legislator has used a cannon to hurt a f y." 52 All of these metaphors are meant to drive home the point that the means should f t the purpose. Whenever the purpose can be fulf lled through the use of less limiting means, this should be done. T ere is no sense in using a hammer when all you need is a nutcracker. 53

T e requirement that the means be "narrowly tailored" to achieve the law's purpose fails in two sets of circumstances. In the f rst, the means does not completely achieve the purpose and there are matters required to fulf ll the purpose that are not covered by the means. T is is the case of underinclusiveness. It is not related to the necessity test. Underinclusiveness may highlight an improper motive on the part of the legislator and thus af ect the purpose component. 54 It may indicate that the principle of equality has been violated. It may af ect the suitability of the means used to realize the law's purpose. 55 Either way, it does not af ect the question of necessity. In the second set of circumstances, the means chosen achieve the law's purpose, but they are not "narrowly tailored" to fulf ll that goal in that they limit the right in question beyond what is necessary. T is is the case of overinclusiveness (or over-breadth). In the words of Justice Ngcobo, in cases of overinclusiveness the legislator has cast too wide a net. 56T is is the same as a cannon shooting a sparrow, or a hammer cracking a nut, all the while limiting once again the constitutional right in question. T is aspect – the lack of being "narrowly tailored" – is pertinent to the necessity test.

- (Barak, P.). 53 Some commentators are of the opinion that this metaphor belongs with the rational connection test. See, e.g., W. van Gerven, "T e Ef ect of Proportionality on the Actions of Member States of the European Community: National Viewpoints from Continental Europe," in E. Ellis (ed.), T e Principle of Proportionality in the Laws of Europe (1999), 37, 61. In some places, I have placed this metaphor within the framework of the third test of proportionality stricto sensu . See Shtanger , above note 52. T e correct "location" of the metaphor is within the framework of the test of necessity. However, the metaphor itself is far from perfect. It does work well to demonstrate the waste of resources (on one side of the equation), but fails to demonstrate the over-damaging ef ect on the right in question

#### Necessity 335

### 2. Overinclusiveness

 Overinclusiveness occurs whenever only a portion of the means, which limit the constitutional right, are required to achieve "full coverage" of the law's purpose; in other words, not all the measures adopted are required to achieve the law's purpose. 57 Instances of overinclusiveness are divided into two groups. T e f rst group includes situations where it is possible to dif erentiate between the means not necessary to achieve the purpose (the "overinclusive" means) and the means required to achieve that purpose. T us, the law's purpose may be achieved without the additional limitation on human rights caused by the "overinclusive" means. In these cases, overinclusiveness leads to the conclusion that the means are not necessary. T e remedy may be the separation of those means necessary to achieve the purpose from those that are not. Here, the necessity test and the restriction on overinclusiveness merge; they are identical. An example of such a case is the South African case of Coetzee . 58 In that case, the Constitutional Court of South Africa reviewed the constitutionality of a provision which allowed for the imprisonment of judgment debtors. It was held that the provision limited the constitutionally protected right to freedom, and that such a limitation was beyond what was necessary since the law did not distinguish between those debtors who are able to pay and those who are not. T e law's purpose was to create an enforcement mechanism for debtors who were able to pay of their debt. It was not meant to enforce a debt on someone who could not pay. In this case, it is possible to dif erentiate between the "overinclusive" means (an imprisonment of a debtor who is not able to pay) and the means necessary to fulf ll the law (imprisonment of a debtor who is able to pay).

T e second group of situations involving overinclusiveness is more complex. Here, separating the necessary means from the "overinclusive" ones is not possible. In other words, there is no way to fulf ll the law's purpose without using overinclusive means. In these cases tension develops between the necessity test and the restriction on overinclusiveness. Which of the two requirements will prevail? 59T e answer is that the necessity test will prevail. As per the necessity test, overinclusiveness is prohibited only where it is not necessary. When the necessary and "overinclusive" means cannot be separated, overinclusiveness becomes necessary as well. In this

<sup>57</sup> See H. P. Monaghan, "Overbreadth," Sup. Ct. Rev . 1 ( 1981 ). 58 Coetzee v. Government of the Republic of South Africa , 1995 (4) SA 631 (CC). 59 Regarding this question in American law, see Fallon, above note 54, at 1328.

situation (overinclusiveness which cannot be separated), the examination of the limitation caused by the overinclusiveness should not be carried out in the framework of the necessity test but rather within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu . 60

 An example of this approach can be found in the Adalah case. 61 To ensure national security and to defend the state from acts of terror, a blanket ban on the unif cation of families was applied on couples where one spouse was Israeli and the other from the Occupied Territories. As a result of the total ban, the right of spouses from the Occupied Territories who pose no threat to the security of the State of Israel was severely limited. However, the Court held that it was impossible to distinguish between innocent spouses and spouses who pose a genuine threat to Israel's national security. T e individual examination was held to be insuf cient. Under these circumstances, the Israeli Supreme Court has held that the means chosen by the legislator, despite being overinclusive, still satisfy the necessity test. T e results of the blanket ban and those of the individual examination were compared, as follows:

> A comparison between the two levels is not the examination required at this stage of the constitutional review. T e question here is not whether the individual examination limits the rights of the Israeli spouse to a lesser extent than the complete restriction; rather, the question is whether the statutory purpose can be fulf lled through the use of the less-restrictive means. If the less-restrictive means fulf ll the purpose to a level lesser than the means originally chosen by the legislator, then that alternative means cannot be considered necessary. T e requirement as to the lessrestrictive means applies only when those means advance the statutory purpose at the same level as the original. T us, at this stage of the constitutional review, the question is not whether the individual examination limits the right of the Israeli spouse less than the blanket ban. Rather, the question is whether the individual examination fulf lls the statutory purpose at the same level as the blanket ban. If the answer is in the af rmative – both means advance the purpose equally – then the legislator must choose this means. Conversely, if the individual examination does not fulf ll the statutory purpose, then the means are unnecessary, the legislator is not obligated to choose it. T e legislator must only select the means which fulf ll the statutory purpose and which limit the constitutional right of the Israeli spouse the least. 62

<sup>60</sup> See below, at 340.

<sup>61</sup> Adalah v. Minister of Interior , above note 14. 62 Adalah v. Minister of Interior , above note 14, at para. 88 (Barak, P.).

 Despite the overinclusiveness of the blanket restriction, it satisf es the necessity test in those cases where the necessary and the "overinclusive" means cannot be separated. In such a case, the necessity test does not require the adoption of partial inclusiveness. Still, the constitutionality of overinclusiveness will be determined within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu .

# **C. Te necessity test: an evaluation**

# 1. T e "heart and soul" of the proportionality test?

 Israeli case law has expressed the opinion that the necessity test or the demand for the least restrictive means constitutes the " heart" of the proportionality test. T e "responsibility" for such an approach is, f rst and foremost, mine. In the United Mizrahi Bank case, I wrote:

> Of all the tests used within the proportionality test, the most important is the second test. T e requirement that the statute limit the constitutional right in question as little as possible lies at the heart of the requirement of proportionality. 63

T is approach is accepted in comparative law as well. As Peter Hogg has noted in the context of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms:

> T e requirement of least drastic means has turned out to be the heart and soul of Section 1 justif cation … [F]or the great majority of cases, the arena of debate is the … requirement of least drastic means. 64

Is the special status of the necessity test justif ed?

### 2. Necessity: an important test

T ere is no doubt that the necessity test is an important one. While the rational connection test examines the relationship between the means designated by the law and its purpose, the necessity test chooses between several rational alternative means, that which least limits the constitutional right. T e necessity test inquires, while examining the law's prognosis and its factual background, 65 whether the law's purpose could have

<sup>63</sup> See United Mizrahi Bank , above note 1, at para. 95. 64 See Hogg, above note 28, at 146.

<sup>65</sup> See J. Rivers, "A T eory of Constitutional Rights and the British Constitution," in R. Alexy (ed.), A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]).

been achieved through the use of less restrictive means to the constitutional right in question. Incidentally, it also examines if what was presented as the law's purpose is the law's true purpose. T is examination has a value-laden aspect. However, the necessity test is not a balancing test. 66 T us, for example, when the examination reveals that the less limiting means may limit another right of the person in question, or the rights of other people, or the public interest, then the necessity test does not help solve the dilemma before the court. 67T e same is true in those cases where the alternative, less limiting means are available, but the advancement of the law's purpose is lesser than that of the limiting law. 68 Here, too, the necessity test is of no assistance to the limited right.

 Despite these "weaknesses" of the necessity test, and despite its limited protection of constitutional rights, the test is important. It is an important threshold test. Courts usually prefer to announce the lack of proportionality without resorting to any balancing tests. In that way, the courts avoid unnecessary conf ict with the legislator, as their decision is perceived as a "factual" matter, without the need for balancing. Indeed, in those cases where the necessity test fails there is no need to continue the constitutional review and to arrive at the test of proportionality stricto sensu . In that sense and to that limited extent, the necessity test may indeed be considered the "heart" of proportionality. On the other hand, we should not try and include in the necessity test things it cannot contain. T ese should generally be lef for the balancing test of proportionality stricto sensu . Judges should be honest with themselves. T ey must speak the truth 69 and the truth is that in many cases the judge reveals that an alternative means that limits the right in question to a lesser extent does exist; but upon further examination it turns out that these means may not achieve the

law's purpose in full, or that in order to achieve those purposes in full the state has to change its national priorities or limit other rights. In those cases, the judge should rule that the law is necessary, and that the less limiting means cannot achieve the intended legislative purpose. T en, the judge must proceed to the next stage of the examination – and determine the constitutionality of the law within the framework of proportionality stricto sensu . 70 T us, although the necessity test may no longer be seen as the "heart" of the proportionality requirement, it can def nitely be considered as playing an important role in its application.

# Proportionality stricto sensu (balancing)

# **A. Te characteristics of proportionality stricto sensu**

### 1. T e content of the test

T e last test of proportionality is the "proportional result," or "proportionality stricto sensu " ( Verhältnismässigkeit im engeren Sinne ). T is is the most important of proportionality's tests. What does the test require? According to proportionality stricto sensu , in order to justify a limitation on a constitutional right, a proper relation ("proportional" in the narrow sense of the term) should exist between the benef ts gained by fulf lling the purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right from obtaining that purpose. T is test requires a balancing of the benef ts gained by the public and the harm caused to the constitutional right through the use of the means selected by law to obtain the proper purpose. Accordingly, this is a test balancing benef ts and harm. It requires an adequate congruence between the benef ts gained by the law's policy and the harm it may cause to the constitutional right. As I have written on this test in Adalah :

> A proper purpose, a rational connection between the statute's purpose and provisions while using the least restrictive means which can still achieve the proper purposes – are all necessary conditions for the constitutionality of the limitation of human rights. T ese are insuf cient conditions. A constitutional regime seeking to realize a regime of human rights is not satisf ed by these. Rather, it also sets up a line which cannot be crossed by the legislator regarding the protection of human rights. It demands that the fulf llment of the proper purpose – by rational means that are least restrictive in achieving the purpose – cannot lead to a disproportional limitation of human rights. 1

Consider the following examples regarding the use of this sub-test:

- (a) A provision in the Law of Citizenship and Entry into Israel (Temporary Order), 2003 2 sets a blanket restriction on the entry of spouses of Israeli citizens residing in the Occupied Territories (Gaza and the West Bank) into Israel. T e reason behind this is national security. 3 T e Israeli Supreme Court held that the restriction satisf es the proper purpose, rational connection, and necessity components. 4 Does the law satisfy the proportionality stricto sensu test? Five Justices (out of the eleven) were of the opinion that the test was not met, since the law "sets a disproportional relation between the measure of additional security in comparison to the former arrangement, which was based on individual examination … and the additional harm to the constitutionally protected right to human dignity that the new measure creates." 5 Five of the remaining six Justices were of the opinion that the relation was proportional. T e eleventh Justice held that the necessity test was not met.
- (b) A provision in legislation relating to the Security Fence in the West Bank ordered the seizure of land – while compensating the owners – for the erection of the fence. T e purpose of the fence's erection was national security. It was held that a rational connection exists between the erection of the fence and these national security considerations. Finally, it was held that no other means would have achieved this national-security-related goal with less restrictive ef ect. However, the Court held that the part of the fence at issue did not meet the proportionality stricto sensu test. As noted in my opinion: "T ere is no proportional relation between the degree of harm to the local residents and the security-related benef ts yielded by the erection of the Security Fence in the precise location ordered by the military commander. T e construction of the fence in that location would undermine the delicate balance between the commander's duty to guarantee national security and his duty to guarantee that the needs of the local residents are met. Our approach is based on the notion that the location chosen by the military commander for the Security Fence – which would separate the local residents from their farmlands – causes extensive harm

to those local residents while violating their rights in accordance with International Humanitarian Law." 6

- (c) Regulations promulgated in Ontario, Canada, following the enactment of the Canadian Health Disciplines Act 7 restricted dentists' advertisements. A dentist who broke this law was convicted and appealed to the Supreme Court. T e Canadian Supreme Court held that the regulations limited the dentist's right to freedom of speech. 8 Regarding proportionality, the Court held that the regulations were promulgated for a proper purpose and that they met the rational connection test. T e Court held that the benef ts in ensuring professionalism and preventing irresponsible and misleading advertising are not proportional to the harm done to the freedom of expression.
### 2. T e nature of the proportionality stricto sensu test

T e proportionality stricto sensu test is a result-oriented test. It equally applies to laws limiting constitutional rights shaped as rules and laws limiting constitutional rights shaped as principles. It applies whether the purpose of the limiting law is to protect another constitutional right or the public interest. Any law limiting a constitutionally protected right must meet the test of proportionality stricto sensu . T is is a test that examines the result of the law and the ef ect it has on the constitutional right. T is test compares the positive ef ect of realizing the law's proper purpose with the negative ef ect of limiting a constitutional right. T is comparison is of a value-laden nature. 9 It is meant to determine whether the relation between the benef t and the harm is proper.

T e moral nature of the test – as well as its importance – is well demonstrated by an example presented by Grimm. 10 Assume a law that allows the police to shoot a person (even if this shooting would lead to that person's death) if it is the only way to prevent that person from harming another's

property. T is law is designed to protect private property, and therefore its purpose is proper. T e means chosen by the legislator are rational, since it advances the proper purpose. According to the provision's own words, it can only be triggered when no other means exist to protect the property without hurting a human life. T erefore, the law meets the necessity test as well. However, the provision is still unconstitutional because the protection of private property cannot justify the taking of human life.

### 3. Proper relation: a balancing test

 At the foundation of the proportionality stricto sensu test is the requirement of proper relation between the benef t gained by the limiting law and the harm caused by it. T e limitation on a constitutional right is not proportional stricto sensu if the harm caused to the right by the law exceeds the benef t gained by it. T is is a balancing test. T e term "balancing" has dif erent meanings in dif erent legal contexts. 11 In this book, "balancing" is an analytical process that places the proper purpose of the limiting law on one side of the scales and the limited constitutional right on the other, while balancing the benef t gained by the proper purpose with the harm it causes to the right. 12

 Comparative law understands proportionality stricto sensu as ref ecting a balance between those two competing principles. T is is the law as set out in rulings in South Africa, 13 Canada, 14 the United Kingdom, 15

Ireland, 16 Germany, 17 Israel, 18 and the other countries that have adopted the concept of proportionality. T e European Court of Human Rights expressed this notion in Sporrong :

> T e Court must determine whether a fair balance was struck between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights … T e search for this balance is inherent in the whole of the Convention. 19

### 4. T e uniqueness of the test

T e f rst three components of proportionality deal mainly with the relation between the limiting law's purpose and the means to fulf ll that purpose. T is examination is conducted against the background of a claim that a constitutional right has been limited. However, the examination's focus is not the limited right, but rather the purpose and the means to achieve it. Accordingly, those tests are referred to as means-end analysis.20 T ey are not based on balancing.

T e test of proportionality stricto sensu is dif erent. 21 It does not examine the relation between the limiting law's purpose and the means it takes to achieve it. Rather, it examines the relation between the limiting law's purpose and the constitutional right. It focuses on the relation between the benef t in fulf lling the law's purpose and the harm caused by limiting the constitutional right. 22 It is based on balancing. Noting the dif erence between the necessity test and that of proportionality stricto sensu , Rivers has written:

> It is vital to realize that the test of balance has a totally dif erent function from the test of necessity. T e test of necessity rules out inef cient human rights limitations. It f lters out cases in which the same level of realization of a legitimate aim could be achieved at less cost to rights. By contrast, the test of balance is strongly evaluative. It asks whether the combination

### **B. Te rule of balancing**

### 1. T e centrality of balancing

 Balancing is central to life and law. 24 It is central to the relationship between human rights and the public interest, 25 or amongst human rights. 26 Balancing ref ects the multi-faceted nature of the human being, of society generally, and of democracy in particular. 27 It is an expression

Planet Earth revolves around the sun 'to balance' between the gravitational forces pushing it towards the sun and the gravitational forces pulling it back to outer space. Each and every one of us is a kind of 'balance' between their father and mother and their respective families. T e same is true for every living organism. T e same is true of the legal universe: Every legal norm represents a balance between interests and forces pulling in dif erent directions. T is is true for all constitutions, for Basic Laws, for ordinary legislation, for regulations – every legal norm, whether general or individual. Every 'law' is ultimately a 'balance.' Every legal norm has its own 'balance.' Part of that 'balancing' is determined by the legislator; the other part is
- determined as per the legislator by the courts." (Cheshin, J.)). 25 Ibid ., at 413 ("T e history of Israeli case law is the history of f nding the right balance between the individual and the general public. T e main contribution of the Israeli Supreme Court to the development of Israeli law, since the establishment of the State of Israel, has been the recognition of human rights and the determination of the proper balance between those rights and the need to guarantee the public peace and safety. Once the Israeli Supreme Court has recognized those (natural) human rights, and granted them a superior legal status, it had to balance between those rights and the needs of the community as a whole. T e Court's most important decisions in all legal f elds – either private or public – emphasized the need to draw a balance between an individual and the public, between the individual and the community as a whole, between human rights
- and the need for public peace and safety" (Barak, P.)). 26 CA 6024/97 Shavit v. Rishon LeZion Jewish Burial Society [1999] IsrSC 53(3) 600, 649 ("We are faced with two conf icting values … How should this Court resolve such a conf ict? T e answer provided to this question, ever since the establishment of the State of Israel, is that the Court should put the conf icting values on either side of the legal scales. It should balance between the conf icting values and principles. It should determine between that balance according to the relative weight of the conf icting values at the point of determination. T is is the way this Court has been working from its establishment and until this very day. T is … balancing … applies in our public law … Indeed, since the establishment of the State of Israel we have been dealing with balancing between conficting values and interests." (Barak, P.)). 27 See above, at 218.

of the understanding that the law is not "all or nothing." Law is a complex framework of values and principles, which in certain cases are all congruent and lead to one conclusion, while in other situations are in direct conf ict and require resolution. T e balancing technique ref ects this complexity. At the constitutional level, balancing enables the continued existence, within a democracy, of conf icting principles or values, while recognizing their inherent constitutional conf ict. 28 At the sub-constitutional level, balancing provides a solution that ref ects the values of democracy and the limitations that democracy imposes on the majority's power to restrict individuals and minorities in it.

### 2. Balancing and validity

T e discussion regarding balancing, followed by the discussion regarding the weight, is a metaphor. 29 T e scales do not actually exist. T e consideration regarding balancing is normative in nature. It assumes the very existence of conf icting principles. T is is meant to resolve those conf icts. T e solution is not by providing a permanent label of "weight" to each conf icting principle, but rather through shaping legal rules – the rules of balancing – that determine under which circumstances we may fulf ll one principle while limiting another. T ose balancing rules ref ect the relation between the conf icting considerations at the foundation of the realization of each conf icting principle. T ey are evaluated according to their relative weight at the point of conf ict. T e solution to such a conf ict is not through upholding the validity of one principle while denying any validity to the other; rather, the balancing approach ref ects the notion that the legal validity of all of the conf icting principles is kept intact. 30 T eir scope is preserved. T e result of the conf ict is not a change in the

Lakof and M. Johnson, Metaphors We Live By (University of Chicago Press, 1980 ). 30 See above, at 87.

principles; it is in the possibility of the realization of the principle at the sub-constitutional level.

 Balancing rules have dif erent roles in the law. In the present context, it is important to distinguish between interpretive balancing and constitutional balancing. 31 In interpretive balancing, the balancing is used to determine the purpose of the interpreted law. It outlines its normative boundaries. 32 Constitutional balancing, in contrast, is designed to determine the constitutionality of a sub-constitutional law. It is not designed to interpret the sub-constitutional law, but rather to determine its validity. Constitutional balancing – and the balancing rules it develops – are meant to resolve the tension between the benef t obtained in the realization of the law's purpose, and the harm caused to the constitutional right. T us, for example, the balancing rules are meant to determine the constitutionality of a sub-constitutional law (a statute or the common law) that realizes the constitutional right to free speech and therefore limits the constitutional right to privacy. Equally, the constitutional balancing rule determines the constitutionality of a sub-constitutional law that limits a constitutional right (such as free speech or privacy) in order to realize a public interest (such as national security). T e conf icting principles exist at the constitutional level and operate at the sub-constitutional level; therefore, the balancing rule should also be found at the constitutional level. 33 T e constitutional rules of balancing are "housed," therefore, within the limitation clause; more particularly, they can be found within the proportionality stricto sensu test. Whenever a country's constitution contains a specif c limitation clause, the constitutional balancing rule can be found within that specif c limitation clause; whenever a constitution does not contain an explicit limitation clause regarding rights conf icting amongst themselves or with the public interest, the constitutional balancing rule can be found within an implied, or judge-made, limitation clause. 34 Either way, the rules of proportionality stricto sensu are found in the constitution. T ey exist at a constitutional level. T ey determine whether a sub-constitutional law that limits a constitutional right satisf es the requirements of the limitation clause. If the answer to this question is yes, then the limitation of the constitutional right is constitutional,

and therefore valid. If the answer is no, then the limitation on the right is unconstitutional and therefore invalid. 35

 A special case is that found in the United Kingdom's Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). 36 Regarding this law, both the right as well as the limiting law are found at the same normative level – this is at the statute level. Ostensibly there is no room to discuss this matter in this context. T e reason for this is that the solution to the conf ict between the right and its limitation could be found in the rules which regulate conf icting laws, according to which the law later in time prevails ( lex posterior derogat legi priori ), unless the earlier law is more specif c ( lex specialis derogat legi generali ). T is solution was denied in the HRA. T e court has been authorized solely to determine if there is an incompatibility between the conf icting laws and, if such laws are incompatible, to give a declaration of incompatibility. 37 Under these legal regimes there is room to apply the rules of proportionality in general, and in particular the balancing element within them. 3839

### 3. T e nature of the balancing

 Whenever constitutional balancing is triggered – whenever a constitutional right is limited by a sub-constitutional law – the balancing rule asks us to place on one end of the scales the purpose that the sub-constitutional law attempts to advance, the probability that the benef t that would be gained from fulf lling this proper purpose would actually be realized, and the benef t that is gained by fulf lling the proper purpose, in accordance with its urgency (the scale of fulf lling the purpose). On the other end of the scale should be the limited constitutional right, the harm it incurs and the probability that such harm would actually occur (the scale of limiting the right). We should establish a normative rule which determines the relative weight of each side of the scale. 40 Based on this weight we could determine which end of the scale is heavier. 41 T us, it is necessary to balance the scale of fulf lling the purpose with the scale of limiting the right. How do we conduct such a balance?

<sup>35</sup> Regarding balancing within the UK Human Rights Act of 1998, see above, at 159. 36 Human Rights Act 1998, c. 42 (Eng.).

<sup>37</sup> See ibid ., section 4(2). 38 See above, at 159. 39 See Kavanagh, above note 22, at 307.

<sup>40</sup> Regarding the scale metaphor, see the opinion of Justice O'Regan of the Constitutional

Court of South Africa in S . v. Bhulwana , 1996 (1) SA 388 (CC), § 18. 41 F. Schauer, "Prescriptions in T ree Dimensions," 82 Iowa L. Rev . 911 ( 1997 ).

 At the center of the rules of balancing – and at the center of proportionality stricto sensu – is the search for legal rules that determine the conditions in which a limitation of a constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law are proportional stricto sensu . No one seriously suggests that such a conf ict should be resolved through the toss of a coin. Everyone agrees that we should adopt a principled, normative approach to the conf ict. T e issue lies with the shaping of the normative approach to solve the balancing problem.

### 4. Balancing based on the importance of the benef ts and the importance of preventing the harm

### i. T e social importance

T e relevant rule according to which the weight of each of the scales should be determined is that of the social importance of the benef t gained by the limiting law and the social importance of preventing harm to the limited constitutional right at the point of conf ict. 42

T e main issue is, of course, how should we determine the social importance of the benef ts gained by the limiting law and the social importance of preventing harm to the limited constitutional right. T e answer is that the determination is not scientif c or accurate. T e balancing between conf icting principles is not conducted through scientif c instruments. Rather, it is derived, inter alia , from dif erent political and economic ideologies, from the unique history of each country, from the structure of the political system, and from dif erent social values. T e legal system at issue should be observed as a whole. T e assessment of the social importance of each of the conf icting principles should be conducted against the background of the normative structure of each legal system. T is kind of balancing should be af ected by the entire value structure of the particular legal system. We should consider the constitutional status of the

42 HCJ 14/86 Laor v. Israel Film and T eatre Council [1987] IsrSC 41(1) 421, 434 (In order to determine this balance, the conf icting values should be given a weight. T ese expressions – "balancing," "weight" – are only metaphors. Behind them stands the notion that not all principles are equally important in the eyes of the community in which they reside. Without legislative directive, the Court should evaluate the relative social value associated with the dif erent principles. Much like you cannot have a person without a shadow, you cannot have a principle without a weight. T e determination of the balance based on weight means the assessment of the social importance of each of the principles at the point of conf ict.) See also Kavanagh, above note 22, at 234; M. Cohen-Eliya and I. Porat, "American Balancing and German Proportionality: T e Historical Origins" 8 Int'l J. Const. L . 263 ( 2010 ).

conf icting principles. Principles found in the constitution are prima facie of greater social importance than those external to the constitution. T at is insuf cient. T e importance of principles – and the importance of the prevention of their harm – is not determined solely by their normative status. Principles at the same normative level can be considered to be of dif erent social importance. T ese kinds of values may be inf uenced by both extrinsic and intrinsic factors. 43 T e extrinsic factors are of a social nature. T ey ref ect society's history and culture. 44 T e intrinsic factors are of a normative nature. 45T ey ref ect the internal relations of the dif erent principles. T us, for example, a right that constitutes a precondition to another right may be considered more important.

### ii. Clarifying the scope of balancing

**a. Generally** On the surface, the task of comparing the benef ts and harm seems almost impossible. How can we compare the benef ts inherent in national security and the harm incurred to the right of freedom of speech? It is appropriate, therefore, at this early stage of the discussion, to def ne the issue more narrowly, or to clarify its scope properly. Such a clarif cation is two-pronged. First, it is important to note that the comparison is not between the importance of fulf lling the purpose of the limiting law and preventing the harm to the constitutional right. Rather, the comparison focuses only on the marginal ef ects – on both the benef ts and the harm – caused by the law. In other words, the comparison is between the margins. Second, in order to conduct the balance properly we must consider the hypothetical proportional alternative to the limiting law. If, indeed, such an alternative exists, then the comparison between the marginal benef ts and marginal harm is made in light of that proportional alternative. Although this alternative was not adopted by the limiting law itself, the lawmaker can still adopt it as an amendment to the limiting law. T ese two clarif cations will now be examined in turn.

### **b. First clarifcation: comparing the marginal beneft to the marginal**

**harm** In determining the balancing we compare the weight of the social importance of the benef t gained by fulf lling the proper purpose and the weight of the social importance of preventing the harm that this fulf llment may cause to the constitutional right. T is comparison focuses on the state of af airs prior to the law's enactment and the changes caused by

the law. Accordingly, the issue is not the comparison of the general social importance of the purpose (security, public safety, etc.) on the one hand and the general social importance of preventing harm to the constitutional right (equality, freedom of expression, etc.) on the other. Rather, the issue is much more limited. It refers to the comparison between the state of the purpose prior to the law's enactment, compared with that state af erwards, and the state of the constitutional right prior to the law's enactment compared with its state af er enactment. Accordingly, we are comparing the marginal social importance of the benef t gained by the limiting law and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right caused by the limiting law. T e question is whether the weight of the marginal social importance of the benef ts is heavier than the weight of the marginal social importance of preventing the harm. T is approach to proportionality was applied by the Israeli Supreme Court in Adalah . 46 Before the legislation of the Law of Citizenship and Entry Into Israel (Temporary Measure) 2003, the unif cation of an Israeli spouse and their spouse from the Occupied Territories was prevented when an individual security check raised questions regarding whether the spouse from the Occupied Territories was a security threat. T e law revoked this arrangement, as under it, at least twenty-six spouses involved in terrorist activities were permitted to enter Israel. In order to remedy this situation, the new law imposed a blanket ban on family unif cation for a period of one year (with an option to extend). When presenting the issue of whether the law's regulatory framework is proportional stricto sensu , 47 I wrote:

> T e issue before us is not the national security of the residents of Israel or the respect of the human dignity of the Israeli spouses. T e issue is not about life, or quality of life. Rather, the issue before us is much narrower. Does the additional security achieved by the transition from the strictest individual examination possible by law of the non-Israeli spouse to a blanket restriction on entry into Israel have an adequate relation (that is, is proportional) to the additional harm caused to the human dignity of the Israeli spouse as a result of such a transition? 48

### In a similar vein, Grimm has noted:

 It is rarely the case that a legal measure af ects a fundamental right altogether. Usually, only a certain aspect of a right is af ected. For

- 
- 46 See Adalah , above note 1. 47 Regarding the necessity component in Adalah , see above, at 321. 48 Ibid ., para. 91 (Barak, P.).
- 

instance, a law may regulate not all speech but, rather, commercial speech regarding certain products and in certain media. T e weight of the aspect of the right that has been regulated in relation to the right at large must be determined carefully. T e same is true for the good in whose interest the right is restricted. Rarely is one measure apt to give full protection to a certain good. Only certain aspects of this good will be af ected in a salutary way. T e importance of these aspects in view of the good at large must be carefully determined, as well as the degree of protection that the measure will render. 49

 Take, for example, a statute limiting the right to freedom of occupation by imposing a ban on the sale of a product that may be dangerous to public health. While determining the proper balancing point between obtaining the benef ts and preventing the harm, the question is not one of what is the balance between the weight of the social importance of the principle of public health and the weight of the social importance of the principle of freedom of occupation; rather, the issue is much narrower in scope: what is the balance between the weight of the marginal social importance of the benef t to public health achieved by imposing the restriction and the weight of the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to freedom of occupation that is caused as a result of the restriction.

T e issue, therefore, focuses on the constitutionality of the weight of the marginal social importance of the benef t and harm. In most cases, the analysis presupposes a state of af airs whose constitutionality is not at issue. From that premise stems the question of whether the change brought by the new law – in the narrow scope in which it occurs – is constitutional. Obviously this narrow scope may become wider if the current state of af airs is unconstitutional and the constitutional argument applies to the existing condition as well. In a case such as this we should once again narrow the scope of the review as much as possible so that it applies to the analysis only from the point where no argument exists regarding its constitutionality.

## **c. Second clarifcation: considering a proportional alternative** A close examination of the comparison of the weight of the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by the limiting law and the marginal

<sup>49</sup> Grimm, above note 10, at 396. See also S. J. Heyman, Free Speech and Human Dignity (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2008 ), 70: "[B]alancing seeks to determine which right has more weight. T is determination should be made at the margin – that is, instead of asking whether freedom of speech or, say, the right to privacy has greater value in general, one should ask (1) how much the value of privacy would be af ected by the speech at issue, and (2) how much the value of free speech would be impaired by regulations to protect privacy."

social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right teaches us that in most cases the scope of the comparison is even narrower. T us far, we have compared the state of af airs before the law was enacted to that state af erwards. However, we must recall that, while examining the necessity test, possible hypothetical alternatives were examined. 50 At times included within those alternatives are alternatives that would be able to gain the main marginal social benef t while causing less harm to the constitutional right. T ese alternatives do not meet the necessity test as they do not fulf ll fully the purpose of the limiting law. 51 T ese alternatives can be reintroduced into the constitutional discussion within the test of proportionality stricto sensu , if one of those alternatives, if enacted into law, can meet the requirements of the proportionality stricto sensu test. Accordingly, the starting point for the comparison in this type of situation is not just the state of af airs prior to the law but also the state of af airs should the hypothetical alternative solution be adopted by law. T us, on the f rst scale – that of "fulf lling the proper purpose" – we place the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by rejecting the possible alternative and adopting the proposed law, while on the scale of "harming the constitutional right" we place the marginal social importance of preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right from rejecting the possible alternative and adopting the proposed law. T e question examined in this scenario is which has the heavier weight on the scales.

 An example of such marginal benef t and harm can be found in the Israeli Supreme Court case of Beit Sourik . 52 T ere, the Court examined the legality of a decision by the Israeli government to erect a Security Fence in the West Bank. T e purpose of erecting the fence was the prevention of the entry of terrorists into Israel or Israeli settlements within the Occupied Territories. T e Court held, f rst, that the order which permitted the fence's erection – which limited the rights of the local Arab residents – had a proper purpose. As for the means, the Court held that there was a rational connection between the fulf lling of the security purpose and the means chosen. In addition, it was held that several alternatives of ered to the Court as to the location of the fence – despite causing less harm to the local Arab residents – could not have achieved the same degree of

security that the order sought to promote. Accordingly, the Court held that the law met the necessity test as well. But doubts arose in relation to proportionality stricto sensu . What comparison should be made here? Is it a comparison between the state of af airs that existed before the issuance of the executive order and the one that existed af erwards, while comparing the marginal measure of security obtained by the fence and the marginal measure of harm caused to the local Arab residents? Or, perhaps the correct comparison was to the alternatives proposed to the Court? True, these alternatives did not satisfy the requirements of necessity, since they did not of er the same degree of additional security as achieved by the proposed fence. Still, it was held that, if that alternative had been chosen by the Israeli government, it would have satisf ed the requirements of proportionality stricto sensu . Accordingly, the Court determined that the proper basis for comparison should not be between the state of af airs ex ante and ex post , but rather between the state of af airs af er the realization of the alternative and the state of af airs af er the issuance of the order. As I wrote in my opinion:

> T e third test of proportionality determines that the harm caused to the individual from the means chosen by the administrative authority to fulf ll its purposes must be proportional to the benef ts brought about by that means. T is is the test of the proportional means (or proportionality stricto sensu ). T at test is usually applied in "absolute terms," that is while directly comparing the benef ts gained by the executive action and the harm caused by it. In some cases the same test may be applied "relatively," that is while comparing the executive action with an alternative measure which could not yield the same level of benef ts produced by the original executive action. T us, the original action would be disproportional according to the third test in cases where a small reduction of the benef ts gained by the original action, such as the adoption of the alternative means, would guarantee a signif cant reduction of the harm caused to the constitutional right by the original means … T e real issue before us is whether the additional advantage to national security gained by adopting the approach expressed by the military commander … is proportional to the harm that adopting such an opinion would cause … Our answer is that the choice made by the military commander as to the route of the separation fence is disproportional. T e disparity between the security measures required by the military commander's opinion and the security measures gained by the alternative route is much smaller than the signif cant disparity that exists between a fence separating local residents from their land and a fence that does not create such a separation, or whose separation is so small that it can be lived with. 53

> > 53 Ibid ., at 840, 851–852.

 It is obvious that this basis for comparison exists only if the alternative itself is proportional. If the alternative itself is not proportional – and no other proportional alternative exists – then we must return to the comparison between the marginal benef t and marginal harm caused by the legislation, without considering a possible alternative.

 What, then, is the role of the alternative? Obviously, it does not render the need to determine an "adequate relation" between benef t and harm redundant. Of course it cannot "bypass" the issues of balancing and weight. T e alternative's importance is that it narrows the scope of the balancing actions. T e issue is no longer how to compare between the social importance of the marginal benef t gained by fulf lling the purpose by means of the law (as compared to the state of af airs ex ante ) and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right caused by the law (as compared to the state of af airs ex ante ). T e required comparison, rather, is much narrower: it is between the alternative and the limiting law. We must ask whether the limiting law is proportional ( stricto sensu ) when compared with the alternative. T e solution to this question takes into consideration only a very limited set of marginal benef ts and the prevention of the marginal harm, therefore making the determination of the weight and the balance much simpler.

 It is understood that the basic premise must be that the alternative is proportional. T e examination of this basic premise requires a comparison between that alternative and the state of af airs before the law came into ef ect. We begin this examination with the test of necessity, where we compare the purpose the law fulf lls and the purpose fulf lled by the alternative law. When the result of this comparison is that the alternative cannot completely fulf ll the original purpose, the examination of the necessity test ends. T e examination may continue within the test of proportionality stricto sensu . Here, we also examine the "advancing the purpose" scale. T us, the question is whether the social importance of the marginal benef ts of the alternative option (compared with the state of af airs before the law was enacted and without a viable alternative) is greater than the social importance of preventing the marginal harm caused by the law within the scale of "harming the right" (compared with the state of af airs before the legislation was enacted and without the existence of an alternative). If the result is that the alternative is not proportional, the alternative should not be considered. If the alternative is proportional, then the issue is whether the limiting law is proportional when compared with the alternative.

 An alternative can only be considered if it stands on its own. It must be practical rather than theoretical, real rather than imaginary. It must advance the same purposes that the law sought to advance, although not completely. T e limitation of the constitutional right should be of a lesser extent than the law's limitation. T ese requirements are not easy to fulf ll. In some cases, no suitable alternative exists; either because it is not practical and real, or because it is not proportional. However, when a proportional, practical alternative is available, it should serve as the basis of the proportionality examination of the limiting law. When this comparison is conducted by the court, it should assume that this alternative will be adopted by the lawmaker. T e court should ask itself if the transition from this alternative to the law is proportional stricto sensu . If the answer is in the negative, then the legislation at issue is unconstitutional. However, despite the unconstitutionality of the law, the legislator is not facing a dead end. T e legislator is not required to return to the drawing board, to its position before the limiting law was introduced. Rather, the legislator can reduce the "damage" of the unconstitutionality. It can do so by legislating the alternative. T at way, benef ts will be gained and the harm reduced in comparison to the situation before the law's enactment. It should be noted that the degree of the benef ts obtained would probably be less than that obtained by the original law. However, this partial fulf llment should satisfy the legislator's policy considerations.

 An argument can be made that the examination of the alternative will make the constitutional review more complicated, since, instead of one examination which focuses on the limiting law and the changes it proposes, despite the situation ex ante , two examinations are now executed: the f rst compares the alternative with the state of af airs that existed ex ante , before the limiting law; and the other compares the limiting law with the alternative. Indeed, this critique does carry some weight. However, the very existence of an alternative option is of great importance. It assists in conducting the constitutional examination within proportionality stricto sensu in that it provides an answer to the question of the proper relation between the benef ts and harm. T is assistance is mainly expressed by answering the questions of weight and importance of the conf icting principles. T is alleviation is derived from the narrowing of the questions to be resolved: the questions of benef ts and harm are "divided" into sublevels, and that, in turn, eases the receipt of an answer to the questions of weight and importance.

### **d. Te importance of the clarifcation**

T e two-pronged clarif cation above does not turn balancing into a factual problem. 54 It cannot negate the value-laden discretion of the balance. However, the scope of the legal issues in question – as well as the principles discussed – is made clearer. T e clarif cation allows us to realize that the value-laden issue before the decisionmaker (be it a legislator, a judge, or the executive branch) is not as "expansive" as the balancing between the general principles of security, liberty, life, privacy, and freedom of expression. Rather, the clarif cation helps us to understand that the balance is much narrower in scope and that it balances between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by one principle (beyond the proportional alternative) and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right (beyond the proportional alternative). T at, in turn, helps us to realize the rational nature of the balancing 55 as well as its structural integrity. 56 In addition, this can assist in responding to critics of the proportionality stricto sensu balancing test. 57 T e limits of judicial discretion are drawn more clearly and therefore contribute to the justif cation of balancing as a judicial measure aimed at protecting constitutional rights and justifying the act of judicial review itself. 58

### iii. T e marginal social importance of the "advancing the purpose" scale

**a. Te purpose** On one end of the scales we f nd the purpose that the law seeks to realize. T is purpose is proper, af er it meets the threshold requirements regarding the proper purpose 59 when determining the importance of the purpose, we should focus on the importance of the marginal benef ts in its fulf llment compared to the situation prior thereto or to the possibility of the realization of an alternative. 60 T us, when the purpose is the protection of human rights, the marginal social importance of that purpose is determined in accordance with the protection that these rights received prior to the legislation and that they received following that law. T e same is true for purposes designed to satisfy the public

<sup>54</sup> For a dif erent opinion, see D. M. Beatty, T e Ultimate Rule of Law (Oxford University Press, 2004 ), 170. See also below, at 477. 55 See below, at 485. 56 See below, at 460. 57 See below, at 481. 58 See below, at 473. 59 See above, at 246. 60 See above, at 352.

interest. T e social importance of these purposes is determined as per the marginal social importance gained by their fulf llment compared with the previous situation or with an alternative. T us, the marginal social importance of fulf lling that purpose is inf uenced by the harm caused to other human rights or to the public interest should the law's purpose not be realized. T e larger the harm incurred, the more important the goal of preventing this harm becomes.

 **b. Te probability of fulfllment** In order to answer the question of whether the marginal social importance of the benef t gained from fulf lling the purpose justif es the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right, we must examine the probability of its realization should the proposed law pass constitutional muster. 61T is probability is conditional on factual data, as well as an evaluation (prognosis) regarding the likelihood of fulf llment of that proper purpose. In Adalah , 62 the Israeli Supreme Court examined this question regarding probability:

> T e proper approach to the issue is at the level of the risks and the probability of their realization, as well as their impact on society as a whole. T e questions that must be raised are those regarding probability. T e question is what is the probability that human lives will be lost should we continue with the regime of individual examinations, compared with the probability that human lives will be lost if we move on to a regime of a blanket restriction, and whether this additional probability is equivalent to the increase in harm caused to the rights of some Israeli citizens. 63

T us, in determining the weight of fulf lling the law's purpose (whether it is the protection of another right or fulf lling the public interest) we should f rst consider the probability of the purpose's actual occurrence. 64 T e weight of an important purpose, whose realization is urgent and the probability of its actual occurrence is high, is not equal to the weight of a similarly important purpose, whose realization is also urgent but whose probability of occurrence is extremely low.

> iv. T e marginal social importance of the "limiting of the right" scale

**a. Te considerations in question** T e social importance of the "limiting of the right" scale is determined by the social importance of

<sup>61</sup> See R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press,

<sup>2002 [1986]), 44.</sup> See also Rivers, above note 51. 62 Adalah , above note 1. 63 Ibid ., para. 110 (Barak, P.). 64 See above, at 308.

the limited right as well as the importance in preventing its limitation. Here, too, the social importance is determined according to the principles underlying the limited right as well as the social importance of preventing this limitation. T e weight of the limitation of the right is not determined abstractly but rather is determined in the context of the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right. At the center of the "limiting the right" scale lies the constitutional right itself. T e weight of the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the right is derived from its social importance and is af ected by the scope of the limitation and the probability of its realization. Each of these considerations will now be examined in more detail.

 **b. Te social importance of the right** Are all constitutional rights equal in their social importance? Are there rights that are more important than others? Should we simply conclude that all rights are equal in social importance since their normative status is the same? T e answer is that we should distinguish between constitutional status and social weight. T e constitutional status of a right is determined through constitutional interpretation. Without a constitutional instruction to the contrary, the assumption is that all constitutional rights enjoy the same constitutional status. 65

 Rights of equal normative status are not necessarily rights of equal social importance. T e social importance of a right – and, as a result, its weight in comparison to other rights – is derived from its underlying reasons and the importance of these reasons within society's fundamental understanding of rights. 66 T e understanding that constitutional rights are not all of equal social importance and weight is accepted in Israeli case law. As noted in the Horev case:

> Regarding the protection of constitutional rights from prospective limitations, not all rights are equal. For example, the right to human dignity is not equal to the right to own property. Moreover, within each right there are dif erent levels of protection for dif erent parts of the right. For example, the protection granted to political speech would be greater than that granted to commercial speech. 67

 A similar approach was advanced by Justice Zamir in the Tzemach case:

> Personal freedom is a constitutional right of the f rst order, it is also a precondition for the exercise of other fundamental rights. A limitation of the right to personal freedom – like throwing a rock into still water – creates ripples which limit other rights; not only the right to freedom of movement, but also the freedom of speech, the right to privacy, the right to personal property and other rights. As Section 1 of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty teaches us, "[f]undamental human rights in Israel are founded upon recognition of the value of the human being, the sanctity of human life, and the principle that all persons are free." Only a free person can fully and appropriately realize their constitutional rights. And personal freedom, more than any other right, is that which makes a person free. T erefore, the denial of personal liberty is an extremely harsh limitation. 68

 A comparative law survey conf rms the assumption that many legal systems accept the approach that dif erentiates between the dif erent rights as to their relative social importance. T us, for example, in American law this dif erentiation forms the basis for the noted distinction between three levels of scrutiny. 69 Similarly, the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa states that, in reviewing the constitutionality of a limiting law, the court must take into account "the nature of the right." 70 According to the approach accepted in South Africa, the rights to dignity, equality, and liberty are considered central to South African society. 71 Several court decisions in New Zealand adopted a similar approach. 72 However, a contrary opinion can also be found in comparative law, according to which all constitutional rights are equal in social importance. T is is, for example, the approach adopted in the constitutional law of both Germany 73 and Canada. 74

 Not all constitutional rights are equal in their social importance. T e social importance of a constitutional right – as well as the marginal social importance of preventing its limitation – is determined by the society's fundamental perceptions. T ese perceptions are shaped by the culture, history, and character of each society. T ey are derived from the constitution's purposes. Such considerations can be dubbed "external" considerations. With these, we can f nd other considerations, of a more "internal" nature. T ese are considerations related to the internal relations between dif erent constitutional rights. T us, for example a right used as a precondition for the realization or act of another right is understood as more socially important. 75 From this premise we may deduce the increased social importance of the right to life, to human dignity, to equality, and to political speech – all of which constitute preconditions to the realization of other rights. T e distinction regarding the importance of a right may also apply within the rights themselves (as opposed to between the dif erent rights). T us, the marginal social importance of preventing harm to the right to political speech is unlike the marginal social importance in preventing harm to the right to commercial speech. From that premise we can also derive the marginal social importance of the social rights which, at their most basic level, are meant to provide minimal living conditions to the members of a given community.

T us, the marginal social importance of a constitutional right is determined from dif erent perspectives. Rights that advance the legal system's most fundamental values and that contribute to the personal welfare of each member of the community 76 dif er from rights that rely upon general welfare considerations as their only justif cation. Similarly, "suspect" rights, which historically have been limited by the majority for improper reasons, dif er from rights that are not "suspect" in that way. 77 T e dif erent perspectives at times suit one another. In other cases, they point in dif erent directions. We must assume that, with time, it will be possible to establish more specif c criteria on this matter.

**c. Te intensity of the limitation of the right** T e weight assigned to the "limitation of the right" scale is derived not only from the marginal social importance of the right, but also from the scope of the right's limitation, its intensity, and its size. T e limitation's acuteness inf uences its weight. A limitation of one right (the limited right) dif ers from a limitation on additional rights (in addition to the limited right); similarly, a limitation on the right's core dif ers from a limitation on the right's penumbra; a temporary limitation dif ers from a permanent one.

 **d. Te probability of the right's limitation** Much as the probability of achieving the proper purpose is an important factor in determining the weight of the marginal social importance of the benef t it involves, the probability of the occurrence of a limitation on the constitutional right is an important factor to consider in determining the weight of the marginal social importance of preventing the harm that may be suf ered by that right. A limitation whose probability of occurrence is high dif ers from a limitation whose probability of occurrence is much lower. In the legal literature, this aspect of the "limiting the right" scale is not emphasized. T e reason for this is that, in most cases, the probability of the realization of the limitation is certain. When the limiting law is legislated, the limitation occurs instantaneously. T is is true in most cases, but not all. In those cases where the occurrence of the limitation is not certain, the amount of uncertainty – in other words, the probability of its realization – may af ect the weight of the right's limitation. A law determining certain conditions in which a constitutional right should not be realized dif ers from a law that provides the executive branch with discretion relating to the statutory authority to limit that same right.

### **C. Te basic balancing rule**

### 1. T e elements of the basic balancing rule

T e fundamental measure for the balancer – whether done by legislators, members of the executive branch, or judges – is the marginal social importance of the competing scales. T e terms used in that process are those of marginal social importance. T e marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by the legislation should be compared with the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the right in question. T e rules of balancing should ref ect such comparison. As noted earlier, in determining the marginal social importance of each side of the scales we should factor in the probability of both achieving the desired purpose 78 as well as the probability of the occurrence of an actual harm to the protected right in question. 79

T e basic balancing rule seeks to determine a legal rule that ref ects all the elements of balancing between a law limiting a constitutional right and its ef ect on the constitutional right. It should ref ect both ends of the scales as well as their relationship. It should apply in cases where both of the scales carry a constitutional right (such as a law limiting the freedom of expression in order to better protect the right to privacy), as well as in cases where the societal benef t scale carries public interest considerations (such as a law limiting the freedom of expression in order to better protect national security interests). T us, such a balancing rule should ref ect the marginal social importance of the benef ts created by the limiting law (either to the individuals involved or to the public at large) as well as the marginal social importance in preventing the harm caused to the limited right in question; it should also consider the probability of the occurrence of each. Such a basic balancing rule would be found within the constitutional limitation clause (either explicit or implicit).

### 2. T e components of the basic balancing rule and its justif cation

 Against this background, it is possible to determine the content of the basic balancing rule: T e higher the social importance of preventing the marginal harm to the constitutional right at issue and the higher the probability of such an additional marginal harm occurring, then the marginal benef ts created by the limiting law – either to the public interest or to other constitutional rights – should be of a higher social importance and more urgent and the probability of its realization should be higher. T erefore, we cannot justify a serious and certain limitation of a socially important constitutional right in the fulf llment of a minimal social benef t, to the public interest or to the protection of other less important constitutional rights, whose probability is low. As Justice Zamir of the Israeli Supreme Court noted in Tzemach :

> T e more important the limited right and the more severe the limitation on that right, the more robust a public interest consideration is required in order to justify the limitation. 80

<sup>78</sup> See above, at 358. 79 See above, at 362. 80 Tzemach , above note 68, at 273. See also the opinion of Lord Bingham in R . v. Ministry of Defence , ex parte Smith [1996] QB 517, 554; opinion of Lord Woolf in R . v. Lord Saville of Newdigate , ex parte A and B [1999] 4 All ER 860, 871.

 Such an approach is on a par with the approach developed by Alexy with regard to the substantive law of balancing:

> T e greater the degree of non-satisfaction of, or detriment to, one principle, the greater must be the importance of satisfying the other. 81

 In the constitutional context, Alexy's approach is focused on the importance of fulf lling the proper purpose and the prevention of the harm to the right. T us, the constitutional balancing rule, as per Alexy, should compare between "the degree of importance of satisfying one principle and the satisfaction/non-satisfaction (non-infringement/infringement) of the other." 82 Later, Alexy opines that the substantive law of balancing "identif es what is signif cant in balancing exercises, namely the degree of intensity of non-satisfactions of, or detriment to, one principle versus the importance of satisfying the other." 83

 Despite the obvious similarities and the inf uence of Alexy's approach on mine, it is important to mention the dif erences between my approach and that of Alexy. Alexy does not consider the marginal social importance of the limited right but only the degree of its limitation. Not so with my approach. My approach considers both the marginal social importance of the proper purpose and that of the limited constitutional right. T e basic balancing rule expresses the society's understanding of the marginal social importance of the principles it seeks to advance, while evaluating the content and urgency of these principles, and the probability of their realization, as well as the marginal social importance and probability of harming the constitutional human rights that same society seeks to protect. T is balancing rule expresses the understanding that, in a democracy, a proper purpose – in and of itself – is not enough to justify the use of any means of having it realized. T is matter was discussed in one of my opinions:

> A review of the third test – proportionality stricto sensu – brings us back to the very foundations on which our constitutional democracy is based and the human rights Israelis enjoy. T ese foundations include the notion that the end does not always justify the means; that national security is not a sacred principle above all else; that the proper purpose of increased security measures cannot justify a harsh limitation on the lives of thousands of Israeli citizens. Our democracy is characterized by the fact that its ability to place a limitation on protected human rights is carefully

- 81 See Alexy, above note 61, at 102.
- 82 Alexy, above note 61, at 105.
- 83 Ibid .

restricted. It is based on the recognition that each person enjoys a wall surrounding them which protects their rights, which cannot be breached by the majority. 84

T e basic rule of balancing thus provides a set of general constitutional criteria; these criteria, in turn, determine the scope – and set up the boundaries – of the state's ability to realize its proper purposes and to limit its constitutional rights. T e basic balancing rule therefore "takes rights seriously" in that the public interest is insuf cient as an excuse to limit a constitutional right. It is required that the public interest be so important that it justif es the limitation of the constitutional right at issue. In that respect, the basic balancing rule can be viewed as a "shield" of constitutional rights. 85 T e basic balancing rule is able to prevent harm to socially important constitutional rights that constitute – to use a Dworkinian term – "trumps." 86 However, the basic rule is a rule of balancing. Dworkin's notion of "rights as trumps" is not based on the concept of balancing; in fact, it is meant to prevent it. T e only claim here is that the same basic balancing rule that is proposed herein may lead to many of the same results achieved by viewing those socially valued rights as "trumps."

### 3. Balanced scales

 What should be the case when the scale is completely balanced? 87 In these cases, the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right is equal to the marginal social importance of the benef t in fulf lling the public interest or protecting another constitutional right. In these cases, does the limiting law satisfy the requirements of the test of proportionality stricto sensu ? T e cases where this has occurred are very few; but what is the solution for such cases?

 It could be argued that the solution is procedural in nature. T e burden of persuasion to prove proportionality, including proportionality stricto

sensu , lies with the party arguing for the proportionality of the limitation as a whole. When the scales are balanced, the conclusion should be that the interested party has failed to lif that burden and we have a proven limitation of a constitutional right while a justif cation for this limitation was not proven. Here, the law must be declared unconstitutional. T is claim is wrong. T e burden of persuasion is relevant to the factual aspect of the case; it does not concern issues of law. Completely balanced scales present, f rst and foremost, a legal issue. T e court already has all the facts at this point. Some of those facts have been proved through standard evidentiary tools. Others were demonstrated through presumptions, including the presumption that the burden of persuasion to show the proportionality of the limiting law (i.e., a proper purpose, rational connection, necessity, and proportionality stricto sensu ) lies with the party arguing in favor of a proportional limitation. Now we face the legal issue: what is the rule of balanced scales?

 At times, one can argue that the solution to the question appears in the very text of the limitation clause. Take, for example, the Israeli limitation clause. According to its wording, constitutional rights cannot be limited unless such a limitation is made by a law that satisf es several conditions. Relevant to our discussion is the condition that the legislation can only limit the right "to an extent no greater than is required." T e argument would therefore be that once the scales are equal, the limitation at issue is "no greater" than is required, since it is "equal to" what is required. According to this line of thought, in Israel, whenever the two ends of the scales are equal in weight the legislation satisf es the requirements of proportionality stricto sensu . Such a "textual" approach raises some dif culties and is therefore doubtful. Take, for example, the limitation clause appearing in Switzerland's Federal Constitution:

> Limitation of fundamental rights must be proportionate to the goals pursued. 88

 Is the proportionality requirement posed by this provision satisf ed whenever the two ends of the scales are balanced?

T e solution is not found within textual arguments. Nor is it found within general doctrines of proportionality. Instead, the solution is found in accordance with the views adopted by each constitutional democracy. For this matter, we should distinguish between two sets of cases. In the f rst set of cases, both scales carry constitutional human rights, and the

88 Federal Constitution of Switzerland, Art. 36(3).

marginal social importance of the benef t gained from the protection of one right is equal to the marginal social importance of preventing harm

caused to the other right. It could be argued that in that state of af airs there is no reason not to leave the limiting law intact, since its limitation of one constitutional right is equal to its protection of another. In this situation, the legislative discretion should remain. T e role of the courts as defenders of human rights is fulf lled. 89

 In the second set of cases, one scale carries the marginal social importance of the benef t gained to the public interest, while the other carries the marginal social importance of preventing harm caused to the constitutional right. In this type of case, is the limitation of the constitutional right for the sake of the public interest justif ed? 90 In one type of constitutional democracy, human rights may gain a special status such that whenever the scales are completely balanced the scale with the human right should prevail. When in doubt, liberty prevails ( in dubio pro libertate ). 91 A dif erent constitutional democracy may determine that human rights may be important but even more so is the public interest. In that type of a democracy, whenever the scales are balanced the scale carrying the public interest prevails. When the scales are balanced, the legislator prevails. 92 In light of the central status occupied by human rights in constitutional democracies, and in light of the court's special role in protecting those rights, the issue of the balanced scales should be resolved in favor of the constitutional rights, that is, in favor of liberty.

### 4. T e basic balancing rule and specif c balancing

### i. Basic and specif c balancing

T e basic rule of balancing provides a general rule which allows for the resolution of situations where on the one hand we encounter a marginal benef t to the public interest or to another constitutional right, and on the other hand we encounter a marginal harm caused to the constitutional right. T is basic rule is applied to the circumstances of each specif c case. T is rule should guide the person conducting the balance on how to

Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006), 83. 90 C. B. Pulido, "T e Rationality of Balancing," 92 Archiv für Rechts- und Sozial Philosophie

resolve the issue of conf ict at the point of friction in a specif c case. T us, alongside the basic rule of balancing there is always specif c or concrete balancing. T ese rules are "sensitive" to the case's facts. 93 T is is an ad hoc balancing. T e basic rule of balancing is based on a generalization with a high level of abstraction. T e specif c rules are based on a low level of abstraction.

 Based on the basic rule of balancing, a legal rule that ref ects the specif c balancing is derived. 94 T is constitutes a derivative constitutional rule. 95 T is would be a rule at a much lower level of abstraction, which would balance the relevant data relating to the proper purpose, its marginal social importance, its degree of urgency, and the probability of its fulf llment within each specif c case; it would also balance all the relevant data relating to the limited right, its marginal social importance, the degree of the harm it is likely to suf er and its probability as derived from the basic rule of balancing within each specif c case.

ii. T e legal status of the specif c balancing rule

T e specif c balancing rule is derived from the basic balancing rule. Much like the basic balancing rule, the specif c balancing rule is a constitutional rule. It is of constitutional status as it is directly derived from the interpretation of the constitutional limitation clause (either explicit or implicit). T e ef ect of the specif c rule of balancing – much like the ef ect of the basic rule itself – is at the sub-constitutional level. 96 It is meant to determine whether a sub-constitutional law, such as a statute or the common law, which limits a constitutional right under certain circumstances, is constitutional. T us, the specif c rule of balancing does not af ect the scope of the constitutional right. 97 If, as a result of its application, the specif c rule ends up protecting the constitutional rights of others, this result does not mean that the rule has widened the constitutional scope of those rights in any way. T e specif c rule of balancing only operates at the sub-constitutional level, where the rights are realized and exercised.

 As its name indicates, the specif c rule of balancing only applies to a specif c set of circumstances. Clearly, it can be reapplied to a similar set

of circumstances. It can also be applied by way of interpretive analogy98 in other cases where circumstances are not identical, but bear substantial similarities to the initial case. T e specif c rule of balancing always stands alongside the basic rule of balancing, and ref ects its fulf llment regarding a specif c constitutional context. T e specif c rule of balancing does not change the scope of the limited right. It af ects its realization. It operates only on the sub-constitutional level. 99

# iii. T e specif c balancing rule and the doctrine of "praktische Konkordanz"

 Much like the basic rule of balancing, the specif c rule of balancing applies both when the limitations on constitutional rights are balanced against other rights or against the public interest. T e discussion of the f rst set of cases – balancing two constitutional rights – has been extensively developed in German constitutional law through the doctrine of " praktische Konkordanz ." 100 According to that doctrine, the importance of both sides of the scale should be recognized. T e weight of the f rst scale (containing the f rst constitutional right) should not overtake the second scale (containing the other constitutional right). Instead, the balance should be conducted while trying to satisfy both rights, so that the limitation on the f rst right is equal to the limitation on the other. T e approach was developed in German constitutional law specif cally to address constitutional rights with no limitation clause of their own. T e German courts realized that the lack of a limitation clause does not create a constitutional vacuum, or "absolute" rights. Instead, the rights can still be balanced against each other. Each of these balances is specif c. It takes into account the circumstances of each case brought before the court. It applies a specif c rule of balancing. T is rule operates in accordance with two basic assumptions. First, there are constitutional rights on both sides of the scale; and second, those constitutional rights are equal in importance.

<sup>98</sup> On interpretive analogies, see above, at 75.

<sup>99</sup> See above, at 89. 100 For a discussion of the doctrine, see T. Marauhn and N. Ruppel, "Balancing Conf icting Human Rights: Konrad Hesse's Notion of 'Praktische Konkordanz' and the German Federal Constitutional Court," in E. Brems (ed.), Conf icts Between Fundamental Rights (Mortsel, Belgium: Intersentia, 2008), 273.

### 5. Principled balancing

T e basic rule of balancing operates at the highest level of abstraction. T e specif c rule of balancing operates at the lowest level of abstraction. T e transition from one rule to another is sharp. T ere is room to consider the recognition of an intermediate balancing rule, between the two existing levels of abstraction. T is balancing rule would also be of a principled nature – a principled balancing. T is will be reviewed at a later stage. 101

# Proportionality and reasonableness

# **A. From reasonableness to proportionality**

 What is the relationship between proportionality and reasonableness? Are the two completely dif erent concepts or do they overlap? Are there aspects of proportionality that do not constitute a part of reasonableness, and aspects of reasonableness that do not constitute a part of proportionality? 1 T ese questions arise where a constitutional right 2 is limited by a subconstitutional law. T e same issues also appear in contexts where no constitutional rights are involved. 3 T e focus is only on the f rst set of cases. T ese arose in many common law countries, where reasonableness was recognized long before proportionality. When proportionality "knocked on the door" of those legal systems, it was met by the concept of reasonableness. 4 Courts across several legal systems have ruled that, in light of the use of reasonableness to review the legality – and the constitutionality – of administrative actions, there is no need to recognize proportionality. T e rationale provided was that, if the two concepts were identical, then reasonableness should suf ce; and, if the two were not identical, reasonableness was preferable. Either way, there was no room for proportionality. T is approach was changed with regard to the constitutionality of statutes limiting constitutional rights. T e proportionality rule is now recognized as per the examination of the constitutionality of legislation which limits constitutional rights. It is also recognized where a sub- statutory law (e.g., administrative actions, regulations, executive orders) limits constitutional rights. T e reason for that is that, if the constitutionality

<sup>1</sup> See N. Emiliou, T e Principle of Proportionality in European Law: A Comparative Study (London: Kluwer Law International, 1996 ), 37; P. Craig, Administrative Law , 6th edn. (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2008 ), 635.

<sup>2</sup> In the UK and New Zealand the question arises when a statutory right is limited by another statute. See above, at 157.

<sup>3</sup> In addition, they appear in several other contexts. See Craig, above note 1. 4

of legislation limiting constitutional rights is reviewed according to the requirements of proportionality, then the constitutionality of any other sub-statutory action that limits constitutional rights in accordance with a statutory authorization should also be reviewed in accordance with the same principle. T is makes perfect sense: if the statute is unconstitutional because its limitation of the human right is disproportional, clearly all other sub-legislative actions authorized by the statute limiting the constitutional right are illegal, as they were executed without proper authorization. If the legislation is constitutionally valid since it is proportional, then the authorization it grants to sub-statutory actions should also be proportional. Either way, the constitutional or statutory validity of the sub-statutory action will be determined in accordance with the principle of proportionality. However, the issue of the proper relationship between the two concepts – proportionality and reasonableness – remains in the context of the limitation of constitutional rights. Does the recognition of the concept of proportionality render the concept of reasonableness redundant, or can the two live side-by-side?

# **B. Te components of proportionality and reasonableness**

### 1. T e components of proportionality

 Legislation limiting a constitutional right is constitutionally valid if it is proportional. Proportionality includes four components: a proper purpose; a rational connection between the advancement of the law's purpose and the means chosen by the law to limit the constitutional right; a necessary relationship between the realization of the law's purpose and the means chosen; and a proportional stricto sensu (balancing) relationship between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by achieving the law's purpose and the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right.

### 2. T e components of reasonableness

### i. When is an action reasonable?

 What is reasonableness? 5 What are its components? T ere is no consensus on this matter. 6 T e conventional wisdom is that reasonableness is determined on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with each case's special circumstances. While this statement is undoubtedly true, what are the circumstances relevant to the determination of reasonableness? How do they af ect the concept of reasonableness? Similarly, the aphorism "an action is reasonable if it was done by a reasonable person" does not advance this discussion. Who is the "reasonable person"? When is a person's behavior "reasonable"? Some argue that the "reasonable person" is the court itself. T is too does not advance the understanding of reasonableness. I have been a judge and have always asked myself about how I should act so that my actions are reasonable. Not all my actions are reasonable. How would I know when I acted "reasonably"? How should I act to ensure my actions were reasonable? Indeed, "reasonableness is not personal; it is substantive. It is not the decisionmaker's reasonableness that renders the decision reasonable; rather, the decision's reasonableness turns its maker into a reasonable person." 7 It has been more than forty years since Professor Stone noted that reasonableness belongs to "categories of illusory reference." 8 Indeed, in many cases we use reasonableness in a circular manner.

 In the United Kingdom, the courts developed the Wednesbury test 9 to help in def ning the proper boundaries of reasonableness within administrative law. In particular, the courts were hesitant to intervene unless the unreasonableness was extreme, "so outrageous in its def ance of logic or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it." 10 But when would "simple" unreasonableness turn into "extreme" unreasonableness?

Moran, Rethinking the Reasonable Person: An Egalitarian Reconstruction of the Objective Standard (Oxford University Press, 2003 ). See also H. Avila, T eory of Legal Principles (Dordrecht: Springer, 2007 ), 105; W. Sadurski, "'Reasonableness' and Value Pluralism in Law and Politics," in G. Bongiovanni, G. Sartor, and C. Valentini (eds.), Reasonableness and Law (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009), 129; B. Schlink, "Der Grundsatz der Verh ä ltnism ä ssigkeit," in P. Badura and H. Dreier (eds.), Festschrif 50 Jahre Bundesverfassungsgericht , vol. II (T ü bingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2001 ), 451. 6

A proper answer to that question cannot be found. T e cases have also resorted, ultimately, to a form of circular reasoning. We are back, then, to square one: when can we conclude that an action is reasonable? What are the components of reasonableness? As noted herein, no consensus has ever been reached on this issue. T e notion of "reasonableness" has many varieties in several contexts, even within administrative law. 11

### ii. Reasonableness as a balance between conf icting principles

 I believe we can advance the discussion regarding reasonableness – and break the vicious cycle – by acknowledging that "reasonableness is not a physical or metaphysical concept. Rather, reasonableness is a normative concept. It is achieved through an evaluative – rather than a descriptive – process. Reasonableness is not bound by deductive logic. Rather, it is determined by the identif cation of the relevant considerations and their balancing in accordance with their weight." 12 Pursuant to Sadurski, we may refer to this form of reasonableness as "reasonableness in the strong sense." 13

T us, we can no longer understand reasonableness as existing "on its own." Rather, "reasonableness is, in all cases, a result of the relationship between all the relevant factors and their proper assigned weights. T e notion of reasonableness assumes a pluralistic approach, which recognizes the relevance of several proper considerations and seeks to balance between them by assigning a 'proper weight' to each within their internal relationships … T is 'proper weight' of the relevant factors is determined in accordance with their ability to advance the objectives that underlie the action (or the decision), when reasonableness is at issue. Indeed, a 'proper weight' is not a natural phenomenon inherent within those relevant factors. It is not determined by a logical deduction either … Rather, a 'proper weight' is an evaluation of to what extent those relevant factors advance the goals that the action (or decision) was meant to achieve." 14 As MacCormick has noted:

<sup>11</sup> See Craig, above note 1, at 618. See also M. Bobek, "Reasonableness in Administrative Law: A Comparative Ref ection on Functional Equivalence," in G. Bongiovanni, G. Sartor, and

C. Valentini (eds.), Reasonableness and Law (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009), 311. 12 CA 5604/94 Hemed v. State of Israel [2004] IsrSC 58(2) 498, 506 (Barak, P.). 13 See Sadurski, above note 5, at 129.

<sup>14</sup> See Ganor , above note 7, at 513–514 (Barak. J.).

 What justif es resort to the requirement of reasonableness is the existence of a plurality of factors required to be evaluated in respect of their relevance to a common focus of concern. 15

T erefore, a decision is reasonable if it was reached af er giving the proper weight to the dif erent factors that should have been considered, and if it properly balances between the relevant factors. 16 At the heart of reasonableness lies the notion of balancing. 17

# **C. Te relationship between proportionality and reasonableness**

# 1. Degree of detailing

T e relationship between proportionality and reasonableness in the context of the constitutional rights is based on the def nitions of these notions. 18 Any change in the def nition of reasonableness would obviously change the understanding of its relationship with the concept of proportionality. Take reasonableness as def ned by the English courts in Wednesbury , a def nition based on the notion of "extreme" unreasonableness. According to this standard, a decision is unreasonable only when it contains "something so absurd that no sensible person could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the authority." 19 Such a def nition of the concept of reasonableness, however, is not structured. It is not founded on consecutive analytical steps. It does not distinguish between the lack of a rational connection, necessity, and balancing. In the words of Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme

Court, when comparing the concepts of reasonableness according to Wednesbury and proportionality:

> [U]nreasonableness rests to a large extent on unarticulated and undeveloped values and lacks the same degree of structure and sophistication of analysis. 20

 In some cases, the Wednesbury version of reasonableness does not even recognize balancing. 21 Such reasonableness is sometimes dubbed reasonableness "in the weak sense." 22 Of en it is undistinguishable from the rational connection component of proportionality. A decision is reasonable if a rational connection exists between its objective and the means chosen to fulf ll it. Accordingly, the way reasonableness should be considered dif ers from the way proportionality should be considered. 23 In the Daly case, 24 Lord Stein raised three ways in which the Wednesbury test dif ers from proportionality:

> First, the doctrine of proportionality may require the reviewing court to assess the balance which the decision maker has struck, not merely whether it is within the range of rational or reasonable decisions. Secondly, the proportionality test may go further than the traditional ground of review inasmuch as it may require attention to be directed to the relative weight accorded to interests and considerations. T irdly, even the heightened scrutiny test developed in R . v. Ministry of Defence, Ex p Smith … is not necessarily appropriate to the protection of human rights. 25

 In his judgment, Lord Stein has noted that the three components of proportionality are criteria "which are more precise and more sophisticated than the traditional grounds of review." 26 He further emphasized:

> [T]he intensity of review is somewhat greater under the proportionality approach … [T]he intensity of the review, in similar cases, is guaranteed by the twin requirements that the limitation of the right was necessary in a democratic society, in the sense of meeting a pressing social need, and the question whether the interference was really proportionate to the legitimate aim being pursued. 27

 With this in mind, one can question whether there is any sense in continuing to rely on Wednesbury whenever proportionality applies. T is question has yet to be determined in English law. 28 T e same is true for other legal systems that adopted Wednesbury , such as New Zealand. 29

T is book will focus on the relationship between reasonableness and proportionality in accordance with the def nition of reasonableness adopted by Israeli law (reasonableness "in the strong sense" 30 ). According to this def nition, what is the dif erence between reasonableness and proportionality in the context of the protection of constitutional rights (the second stage of the constitutional review)? At f rst glance, it seems that proportionality is structured, transparent, and focused on the justif cation for the limitation of the constitutional right. 31 Reasonableness lacks all of these. 32 However, there are no inherent restrictions on the development of the concept of reasonableness – and, indeed, it should be developed in that direction – so that the use of reasonableness be transparent, structured, and focused on the justif cation for the limitation of the constitutional right. 33 T us, for example, it could be argued that whenever no rational connection exists between the means chosen to advance the purpose and the proper purpose itself, those means are unreasonable. Similarly, means would be considered unreasonable if there are other means that can advance the law's purpose to the same extent, while being less restrictive – that is, causing less harm – to the constitutional right. 34 As long as those notions are lef undeveloped, we can also view proportionality as stemming from the concept of reasonableness, and constituting one of its many applications.

### 2. Balancing

it 35 ) shows a signif cant similarity between the two situations where the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by achieving the law's purpose have to be evaluated against the marginal social importance of preventing the harm caused to a constitutional right. 36 In that case, the similarity between reasonableness and proportionality is expressed through the balancing component. 37 As Alexy has noted: "Reasonable application of constitutional rights requires proportionality analysis. Proportionality analysis includes balancing." 38 Indeed, the central component of proportionality is proportionality stricto sensu . 39 At the heart of that component lies the notion of balancing between conf icting principles. 40 T e main component of reasonableness is also the balancing between competing principles. Is there a dif erence between the two? T e "technique" of balancing is identical in both concepts. T e person conducting the balance must place, on one end of the scales, the marginal social importance of achieving one principle, and, on the other, the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the other principle. If such a "technique" would be applied to a conf ict between the principles, then both the manner in which we think about reasonableness and proportionality and the result of the two analyses would be the same. To be precise, the argument is not that reasonableness and proportionality are identical. T e claim is much more limited. It relates solely to a situation where the advancement of a law's purpose will limit a constitutional right. T e argument does not extend beyond those circumstances. But, in such a state of af airs, when we consider the relationship between the means limiting a constitutional right and the law's purpose for which they were chosen, there appears to be no dif erence between proportionality and reasonableness. 41 It is possible that, in other situations, where the limitation of constitutional rights is not at stake, the result would be dif erent. 42

# Zone of proportionality: legislator and judge

## **A. Te application of proportionality to the three branches of government: the issue of judicialreview**

### 1. Proportionality and the three branches of government

 Constitutional human rights and the rules of proportionality limiting them apply to all branches of government. T e Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany provides that "[t]he following basic rights shall bind the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary." 1 A similar provision exists in other constitutions. 2 T us, the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch are all bound by the constitution. T e discussion in this chapter begins with the duties of the legislative branch. In a constitutional democracy, legislation lies with the legislator. T e power to legislate is wide in scope. However, it is not limitless. In a constitutional democracy, the legislator is not omnipotent, but rather has its own limitations. One of the most important limitations arises when a legislator seeks to limit a constitutional right. T e said limitation must satisfy the constitutional requirements of proportionality. 3 T ese requirements limit the scope of the legislative discretion when the legislator limits a constitutional right. Accordingly, we may conclude that the members of the legislative branch want to know, should know, and are entitled to know, the limits of their legislative powers. T is information is not directly related to judicial review. Even if a constitution specif cally orders that the "constitutionality of Acts of Parliament … shall not be reviewed

by the courts," 4 the legislator is still obligated, by its constitutional duty, to enact statutes limiting constitutional human rights in a manner which satisf es proportionality's requirements. T e legislator must, therefore, refrain from disproportional legislation. T e legislator is obligated to protect human rights, 5 to act in accordance with the rules of proportionality, and to maintain legislative restraint – even if the legislation's proportionality is not subject to judicial review, but rather only to public review (through the political process).

T e executive branch must respect all recognized constitutional rights. 6 If its actions can limit those rights, they should satisfy the requirements of proportionality. T e organs of the executive branch want to know, should know, and are entitled to know, the limits of their executive powers. T is is true whether or not there is judicial review of legislation. T e actions of the executive branch at the sub-constitutional level, which limit constitutional rights, must satisfy the requirements of proportionality.

T e judiciary is subject to the requirements of proportionality. 7 Every judge-made sub-constitutional law which limits a constitutional right is bound by the rules of proportionality. T erefore, every development of the common law must be conducted in accordance with the rules of proportionality. 8 While fulf lling its function in conducting judicial review on the constitutionality of sub-constitutional laws (e.g., statutes, regulations, or common law), the judiciary must guarantee that this sub-constitutional law will satisfy the requirements of proportionality.

T e conclusion is as follows. T e rules of proportionality are uniform. T ey apply to each of the three branches of government. T ey do not change in accordance with the branch of government that operates within them. T e rules of proportionality that apply to the legislative and executive branches – branches that operate at the sub-constitutional

level and limit constitutional rights – are the same rules of proportionality that apply to the judicial branch, which operates at the sub-constitutional level and creates new law, or exercises judicial review over the creation of new law by the other branches. T is last activity (judicial review of sub-constitutional laws) is the basis and focus of this book. In this framework, the examination will focus on parliament's legislative activities, rather than on executive regulations or sub-statutory (and sub-constitutional) actions. T is chapter now examines this element of judicial review.

### 2. Proportionality, judicial review, and democracy

 Proportionality is pertinent to judicial activity in several dif erent contexts. T e discussion here is limited to the judicial review of statutes limiting constitutional human rights. T e focus of the discussion is the examination of the scope of judicial discretion, 9 when there is a judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes. Naturally, a precondition for such a discussion is the recognition of judicial review. If judicial review is not recognized by the legal system, there is obviously no point in discussing the scope of a judicial discretion which does not exist. 10

 Judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes is one of the hallmarks of modern democracies. It bloomed signif cantly af er the Second World War. It was perceived as one of the most important lessons of the rise of Nazism to power, and as one of the means of preventing this from ever recurring. 11 However, there is no single model of judicial review, 12 and

- Discretion: Legal Knowledge and Right Answers Revisited (Dordrecht: Springer, 2001 ). 10 Our discussion does apply, however, mutatis mutandis , to cases where both the right and its limitation operate at the sub-constitutional level, but the courts can declare that this
- kind of limitation is incompatible with the right. See above, at 159. 11 A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 229. See also D. M.

the institution of en f nds itself subject to harsh criticism. 13 Every society has to make its own mind up as to the adoption of judicial review, and, if so, according to which model. T e selection of a particular model of judicial review of en ref ects a society's specif c political, historical, and social heritage, as well as its political power struggles. With this in mind, it is common to distinguish between "strong" and "weak" judicial review.14

T is book is not the proper forum to examine fundamental questions relating to judicial review, such as whether the institution of judicial review is appropriate for a constitutional democracy, or what is the proper model of judicial review to adopt. 15 However, it is essential to understand that, once a legal system has chosen – either explicitly or implicitly – to recognize the institution of judicial review of the constitutionality of statutes, the critique leveled at the adoption of judicial review in the f rst place should not emerge again when judicial review is applied. T e opinion that there is no room for judicial review in the system cannot be persuasively argued against the actual exercise of judicial discretion within judicial review once such a concept has been recognized by the legal system. Once a legal system has opted to recognize judicial review, and such review is exercised in accordance with the rules of proportionality, the contours of that institution can no longer be shaped by arguments relating to the preliminary issue of whether judicial review should be recognized by that system in the f rst place. 16 T is conclusion relates, primarily, to the criticism against the "non-democratic" or "counter-majoritarian" nature of the institution of judicial review; specif cally, it was argued that the judicial discretion used by the courts while exercising judicial review should be limited in light of those traits. T e same conclusion applies to those who claim that judges should defer to the legislative branch because they lack a "democratic foundation." T is argument should also be rejected at this stage. Once a society has made a decision – explicitly or implicitly – to

adopt judicial review, its exercise by the courts is a ref ection of the people's will, and thus in ef ect not only embraces basic notions of democracy but actually entrenches them. T e same "we the people" who adopted the constitution also adopted the institution of judicial review. Considerations of "counter-majoritarian dif culty" or "lack of suf cient democratic foundation" should not af ect the actual exercise of judicial review. Rather, judicial review should be exercised in a way that would allow the judges the full ability to inquire whether the other branches – who limited a constitutionally protected human right – have properly followed the requirements of proportionality as prescribed by the constitution's "we the people."

 Accordingly, while examining the scope of judicial discretion in relation to proportionality, there is no room for arguments relating to the democratic nature (or lack thereof) of the institution of judicial review. 17 Much like the member of the legislative or executive branch that must follow the requirements of proportionality whenever a statute limits a constitutional right, the member of the judicial branch must follow the exact same requirements when exercising judicial review of that same legislation. Whenever a statute limits a constitutional right, the legislative, executive, and judicial branches – all founded by the same constitutional document – must respect the same rights and operate in accordance with the same rules as dictated by the principle of proportionality. T e legislator, the member of the executive, and the judge may not relieve themselves from that duty, which is based in the constitution itself, even if they wanted to. 18 Moreover, a possible judicial "fear" that certain judicial review decisions may be "overruled" by new legislation or by a future constitutional amendment should not af ect the application of the rules of proportionality in any given case. 19 Judges must judge, legislators legislate, and constitutional assemblies author constitutions or amend them. If the legislator wishes to change the result of a certain court decision – whether sitting as a legislator or in its special capacity as a constitutional assembly (to the extent such capacity exists) – this is its democratic responsibility. T e existence of one should not af ect the other. Of course, one may criticize judicial review and argue for its abolition. However, so long as judicial review is recognized (explicitly or implicitly), the judges – like the legislators and executives – should be faithful to its existence.

### 3. Proportionality and the separation of powers

### i. Proportionality and discretion

 Every governmental authority must apply the rules of proportionality whenever a sub-constitutional law (such as a statute) limits a constitutional right. Should this premise lead us to the conclusion that the scope of discretion exercised by each of these authorities is equal when it comes to the application of proportionality? 20 T e answer is no. T e components of proportionality – proper purpose, rational connection, necessity, and proportionality stricto sensu (balancing) – do not always lead to the same solution. In many cases, each governmental authority is given the discretion to choose between a number of alternatives. T is discretion exists, naturally, if all the alternatives considered are constitutional. 21 T e scope of the discretion itself, within those constitutional alternatives, may vary from one governmental authority to another. T us, for example, the legislative branch may face a choice between two proportional alternatives limiting constitutional rights: T e f rst advances a less important social purpose while limiting a constitutional right whose prevention is less socially important; the other advances a more important social purpose while limiting a constitutional right whose prevention is more socially important. Let us assume that, when facing such a choice, the legislator chooses one of the two options. T e court now has to determine the constitutionality of that option. In this matter, the court may exercise its own discretion, as for example with regard to the question of whether the prevention of the limitation on the right in question may be more socially valuable than the advancement of the proper purpose. As the example demonstrates, the type and scope of discretion exercised by each of the two branches in this case are dif erent. T e scope of each branch of government is determined in accordance with its proper role within the concept of the separation of powers. As correctly noted by Rivers: "[A] theory of discretion must be co-extensive with the doctrine of proportionality if

<sup>20</sup> T e question was raised by Rivers: see J. Rivers, "Proportionality and Discretion in International and European Law," in N. Tsagourias (ed.), Transnational Constitutionalism:

International and European Perspectives (Cambridge University Press, 2007 ), 107, 108. 21 Regarding the def nition of discretion in general, see Barak, above note 9, at 7. Compare with K. C. Davis, Discretionary Justice: A Preliminary Inquiry (Baton Rouge, LA: Louisiana State University Press, 1969 ); D. J. Galligan, Discretionary Powers: A Legal Study of Of cial Discretion (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986 ); M. Iglesias Vila, Facing Judicial Discretion: Legal Knowledge and Right Answers Revisited (Dordrecht: Springer, 2001 ).

the separation of powers is not to collapse." 22 T erefore, what is the role of each of the governmental authorities in relation to proportionality while adhering to the concept of separation of powers?

- ii. Separation of powers: checks and balances
T e modern concept of separation of powers is based on three elements. First, there is the distinction between the three branches of government: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and the judicial branch. Each branch has its own function. T e main function of the legislative branch is legislation; the main function of the executive branch is execution; and the main function of the judicial branch is judging. T e relationship between each branch and its main function is determined (either explicitly or implicitly) by the constitution. Second, in accordance with the constitutional framework, each branch fulf lls its main function according to its own approach and while exercising discretion without the intervention of the other branches. T is independence in the exercise of discretion does not mean that the other branches estrange the branch exercising its discretion. T e opposite is true: all three branches operate with mutual respect; each also respects the role fulf lled by the others within the constitutional framework and the concept of the separation of powers. T e third element is the notion of checks and balances between the three branches. T e balance points out the interdependence between the branches. T us, for example, in Israel the Committee for the Selection of Judges is made up of nine members, with representatives appointed by each of the three branches of government. 23 T e "check" function indicates the authority to review and supervise the operations of one branch by the others. T ese checks and balances allow each branch to have "independence, with def ned mutual supervision by the other branches." 24 Separation of powers is not based on complete separation and lack of interdependence between the branches; the opposite is true. Separation of powers means mutual checks and balances between the dif erent branches. "Not walls separating the three branches, but bridges that provide checks and balances." 25

T ese three elements of separation of powers are not intended to advance governmental ef ciency. Rather, they are meant to ensure individual

liberty. "T e purpose was not to avoid friction, but, by means of the inevitable friction incident to the distribution of governmental powers among three departments, to save the people from autocracy." 26 "T e separation of powers is not an end in itself. It was not meant to guarantee ef ciency. T e purpose of the separation of powers is advancing personal liberty and preventing the concentration of too much power at the hands of a single governmental branch in such a way that it may trample on such liberty." 27 T e meaning of the principle of the separation of powers is not that each governmental branch can deviate from its authority or execute it illegally, without the other branches being permitted to intervene. Rather, the meaning of the principle is that each branch is free to operate in its f eld as long as it does so in accordance with the constitutional requirements. Separation of powers is not a license granted by the constitution to each of the branches to violate the law.

 Who should determine if the branch in question has operated lawfully? Obviously, each branch, on its own, should review its own actions and ensure that they fall well within its authority. But what is the case when a dispute arises as to the lawfulness of the action in question? How should such a dispute be resolved? Here, the notion of "checks," which characterizes the principle of separation of powers, may provide the answer. According to this notion, 28 whenever a question arises as to the proper interpretation of the constitutionality of an action undertaken by a governmental branch, such a question should ultimately be resolved by the judicial branch. A constitutional democracy does not allow the legislative

or the executive branches the f nal word as to the legality – or constitutionality – of their own actions; indeed, the notion of separation of powers does not grant each branch "absolute power" over its own domain; rather, according to the principle of "checks" that is the hallmark of the modern understanding of the separation of powers, the judiciary is the sole governmental branch entrusted by the constitution with the task of having the f nal word as to the legality – and constitutionality – of the actions taken by other branches of government. 29 Any other solution would seriously impede democracy. T e very existence of the principle of separation of powers requires the creation of a mechanism for resolving questions of the legality and constitutionality of actions undertaken by each branch of government. Such a mechanism for resolving those issues cannot "reside" within either the legislative or executive branches, since such "residence" may grant those branches "absolute powers." It is required, therefore, that the mechanism be external to the governmental branch – legislative or executive – that has allegedly acted beyond its authority or powers, and has committed an illegal or unconstitutional act. T is mechanism must be independent of those branches, and should operate objectively in accordance with one consideration alone – protecting the constitution. T is mechanism is found within the judicial branch. T ere is no better branch to fulf ll the role of checking the other branches. T e independence of the judges; the fact that the judges "represent" no one but the constitution; the fact that they are not politically accountable and their professional training as authorized interpreters of the law – makes the judiciary the most suited to the role of providing "checks" on the other branches of government in accordance with the principle of the separation of powers. Indeed, most constitutions provide the judicial branch (either expressly or implicitly) with the power to resolve disputes and, therefore, incidentally to determine according to which law those disputes should be resolved. It is in this context that Chief Justice Marshall authored his most memorable quote: "It is emphatically the province and duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is." 30

### iii. Discretion of the judicial branch

**a. Discretion** T e principle of separation of powers holds that the main function of the judicial branch is judging. At the heart of judging lies

conf ict resolution. 31 What is the judge's discretion in this case and what is the relation to the legislator's discretion? In this context, judicial discretion is def ned herein as the power – granted to the judge by law – to choose from a number of legal options. 32 According to this def nition, judicial discretion is not a mental or psychological state of mind; rather, it is a legal situation which allows the judge to choose between several legally valid options. T e very existence of judicial discretion, according to my def nition, is not free of doubt: there is a doctrinal dispute about the issue, 33 whose examination is beyond the scope of this book. T erefore, the discussion here begins with the assumption that in certain circumstances the judge is empowered to decide between several alternatives as to the law's content on the issues, as well as regarding its application on the facts of the case. 34

T us, the objects of judicial discretion are the facts, the law, and the application of the law to the facts. 35 T e distinction between law and facts is dif cult, 36 and the issue does not need to be examined here. T e chapter begins with the premise that a fact is anything absorbed by any of the f ve senses, as well as a person's mental state. According to this approach, facts also include evaluations as to the probability of the realization of certain risks or rewards related to the conf ict's resolution. T erefore, the question of the probability that a certain legislative means achieves its desired goal is a factual one. In contrast, the question of whether this probability satisf es the requirements of proportionality is a question of law. T e discussion begins with the judge's discretion regarding facts.

of these facts are "historical," and provide an answer to the question "what happened?" Other facts are "social," and provide answers to questions of social policy at the foundation of the conf ict. 37 Both are presented to the court in accordance with the rules of evidence adopted by each legal system. T e rules of evidence do not always enable a wide enough presentation of the pertinent social facts. It is appropriate that, whenever a court examines the constitutionality of a law, the rules of evidence recognized by that system will provide it with complete information regarding the social aspects of its ruling. T ere is no reason to prevent the social facts available to the legislator from being presented to the court. 38

bb. Polycentric facts Information about the historical facts is fairly straightforward and easy to understand; judges are used to this. In contrast, information about social facts may be more complex and much harder to grasp and to understand; it requires a professional background. Still, this should not prevent it from being presented to the court. If a judge can

learn healthcare issues, engineering standards, and military operations in order to hand down a ruling in private-law cases regarding medical malpractice, negligence in construction, and the negligence of military commanders, they can learn similar matters of healthcare, engineering, and military operations presented in order to prevent such negligence in the future. 39 If members of the legislative body learn this social data from professionals who assist parliamentary committees, judges can also learn those issues through the information presented to them.

 By the same token, the court can learn the issues involved in cases presenting polycentric problems, 40 that is, problems that originate with complex considerations of social or economic policy that require certain assumptions which, in turn, require additional assumptions. If a member of the legislative or executive branch can reach a decision regarding polycentric issues, a member of the judiciary should be able to examine whether or not those decisions are lawful. If a judge presiding over a commission of inquiry can determine f ndings and make recommendations based on polycentric data, he can also rule within the judicial process. If an administrative judge in France, as a part of the Conseil d'Etat, can express their opinions as to a polycentric bill pending before the legislative chamber, they can also rule in accordance with the same law. If a supreme – or constitutional – court can rule on polycentric issues while exercising abstract judicial review, it can do the same while exercising concrete judicial review. 41

cc. Institutional limitations In principle, there is no reason why the same factual framework presented to the legislative or executive branch would not be presented to the judicial branch as well. T e dif culty is not in the judges' ability to digest the facts; it is not personal; rather, it is institutional. 42 T e claim is that the court is not a legislative body. Not all the relevant sides are presented to the court. "T ird parties" that may well

T e court does not have to determine social policy or prioritize social needs. It should examine the constitutionality of these determinations made by the two other branches – the legislative and executive. T erefore, these institutional limitations should not prevent the court from fulf lling its judicial role.

## **c. Te law**

aa. Judicial discretion in determining the law In the context of proportionality, the law manifests itself in three dimensions. First is the scope of the constitutional right. T e means available to the judiciary is constitutional interpretation. 43 Second is the limitation of the constitutional right by a sub-constitutional law. T is limitation is determined by the interpretation of the sub-constitutional law. 44 T ird is the rules of proportionality determined by the constitution. T ese rules are those which arise from the language of the constitutional text (either explicit or implicit). 45 In all three dimensions – interpretation of the constitutional right, interpretation of a limiting law, the application of the rules of proportionality – there may be judicial discretion. Such discretion exists when the judge is authorized to choose between several legal options. 46 Indeed, every interpretive system is based, to a varying degree, on the exercise of judicial discretion. 47 T e construct of the rules of proportionality is also based on discretion. 48

 Judicial discretion is never unlimited. 49 T ese limitations are procedural and substantive. Procedural limitations require the judge to act fairly, objectively, impartially, and equally towards all parties. T e judge should provide reasoning for the court's opinion. 50 Substantive limitations

require the judge to exercise judicial discretion in a rational, coherent, and consistent manner. 51T e judge should always take into consideration that they operate within a given legal system, 52 as well as the need to f t into that legal system. T e judge should take the various institutional limitations into account 53 as well as attempt to reach the best solution possible. Even when judges are behind closed doors and "by themselves," they are always a part of their community, their legal system, and their judicial tradition. 54

bb. Legislative interpretation and judicial discretion How much weight should the judge ascribe to the law's legislative interpretation? What is the proper relationship between legislative interpretation and the interpretation provided by the judge to the same law? 55 T e answer lies with the principle of the separation of powers. T e law's interpretation is for the judge to decide: T e interpretation given by the legislative, or constituent, body to the meaning of legislation or the constitution cannot bind the judge who interprets these.

 interpretation as the other governmental authorities violates the principle of the separation of powers. 56

 Can the judge ascribe some weight to the interpretation provided by other governmental branches while exercising interpretive discretion? If so, precisely how much weight? Can the judge say: "A specif c legal question may have several reasonable (i.e., lawful) interpretations; there is a 'zone of reasonable interpretation.' T e other branch's suggested interpretation lies within that zone. I must choose that particular interpretation, even if I would have chosen a dif erent interpretation"? T e answer to this question is complex. On the one hand, it is clear that the judge cannot disregard the interpretation of other governmental authorities. T e respectful relationship between the branches justif es a review of the interpretation suggested by another branch of government. On the other hand, the judge may not reject his or her own interpretive conclusion in favor of another interpretive view merely because it was proposed by another branch of government.

 According to the rules of administrative law, every decision, which lies within the zone of reasonableness, made by a governmental authority is binding on the judge. T at conclusion is derived from the principle of the separation of powers. T e "zone of reasonableness" is a zone of governmental authority, where responsibility for the governmental action taken – in accordance with the principle of the separation of powers – lies with the state actor who performs it. T is is not the case in relation to the law's interpretive "zone of reasonableness." Here, the principle of the separation of powers requires that the judge – and, within the framework of the judicial branch, the Supreme Court or the Constitutional Court – will determine whether the interpretation appears proper. T e question the court should discuss is not whether the interpretation of ered by the executive branch is reasonable; the question should be what the proper interpretation of the law is.

 In addition to the separation of powers, such a result is also supported by pragmatic interpretive considerations. T e interpreter-judge must

T e Supreme Court of Cyprus has ruled that any attempt by the legislator to appropriate the f nal authority to interpret the law is illegal. See Diagoras Development Ltd . v. National Bank of Greece SA (1985) 1 CLR 581. Any attempt by the legislator to take for itself the f nal authority in interpretation of the law is illegal. See G. M. Pikis, Constitutionalism – Human Rights – Separation of Powers: T e Cyprus Precedent (Leiden, T e Netherlands: Brill, 2006 ), 93.

strive for harmony within the legislative and constitutional frameworks. 57 T e judge must strive for normative unity. T e judge who interprets a single law within the system interprets them all. T e interpretive enterprise aims at achieving normative harmony and uniformity. 58 T is harmony and unity, however, will never be achieved if every single item of legislation stands on its own or is interpreted in accordance with the reasonableness of the interpretation of ered by other governmental branches. In order to achieve such harmony, the laws and the constitution should be seen as one system. T e ultimate responsibility for the law's interpretation lies with the courts. T at responsibility cannot be abandoned, or delegated. Any other approach would lead to anarchy within the system. 59

 In American administrative law, courts follow the Chevron doctrine. 60 According to Chevron , whenever interpretive discretion exists regarding the legislative provision and provided the administrative agency has exercised that discretion reasonably, the court will defer to the agency's statutory interpretation. "[T]he court does not simply impose its own construction on the statute … Rather, if the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specif c issue, the question for the court is whether the agency's answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute." 61 T e literature on Chevron , be it supportive or critical, is rich. 62 According to the approach herein, the Chevron doctrine is misplaced, since it undermines the judicial function "to say what the law is." 63

### iv. Applying the law to the facts

**a. Judicial review** T e core concept of proportionality is the examination of whether a sub-constitutional law (such as statute) limiting a constitutional right is proportional. T e primary decision is made by the

Davis and R. J. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise , 3rd edn. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 1994), 109; C. R. Sunstein, "Law and Administration af er Chevron," 90 Colum. L. Rev . 2071 ( 1990 ); T. W.

legislator and ref ects what appears appropriate to the legislator. T e legislator determines the legislative framework, including the proper purpose, the means, and the limitation of the constitutional right. Judicial review is not meant – and should not be used – to replace this legislative framework with a new judicial framework. 64 Rather, the object of judicial review is much narrower: It is designed to examine the constitutionality of the original framework – that and nothing more. T us, the judge should not be examining a dif erent legislative framework that may appear more appealing to the court; rather, the judge should examine only the legislative framework determined by the legislator. T e basic premise of judicial review is that the legislative function should be fulf lled by the legislator. T us, the court does not substitute the legislator's considerations with its own. T e court does not put itself in the legislator's shoes. T e court does not ask itself what means it would have chosen if it were a part of the legislative body. 65T e court exercises judicial review. It examines the constitutionality of the law, not its wisdom. 66 T e question is not whether the law in question is benef cial, ef cient, or justif ed. T e question is whether the law is constitutional. Both a "socialist" and a "capitalist" legislator may enact dif erent and opposed laws, but both laws would still be proportional. Nationalization and privatization might both occur in this framework. Both market capitalism and a socialist economy may well exist within them. As long as these actions – which limit constitutional rights – satisfy the requirements of proportionality, they are all constitutional.

 **b. Caution in exercising judicial review** Declaring a law unconstitutional due to its disproportional limitation of a constitutional right is a serious matter. A judge would not make such a declaration lightly. Such an act requires respect and judicial caution. T ese requirements are derived from the principle of the separation of powers. However, none of those considerations justify leaving intact a disproportional limitation on a constitutional right. I have elaborated on this issue in one of my opinions:

> Judicial restraint does not equal judicial stagnation. Judicial restraint should not lead to judicial paralysis. T us, when the legislator limits

<sup>64</sup> See R . v. Secretary of State for the Home Department , ex parte Daly [2001] 3 All ER 433

<sup>(</sup>Lord Stein). 65 See Huang v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2007] 2 AC 167 (Lord

Bingham). 66 See T. Hickman, "T e Substance and Structure of Proportionality," PL 694 (2008).

a human right that is constitutionally protected and the limitation is not proportional, the judge has no option but to take a very clear stand. Just as we are not free to render a legislative act invalid merely because we, as judges, would not have enacted that same law were we sitting as members of the legislative branch, nor are we free not to declare a law unconstitutional merely because the legislator was of the opinion that it should be enacted. We, the judges, have a constitutional duty of safeguarding the constitutional criteria by which the constitutionality of a law is measured; we must ensure that those criteria are met in each and every case. 67

**c. Judicial review and judicial "intervention"** In many cases, courts use the term "intervention" to describe judicial activity. 68 T us, the court asks whether it should "intervene" in a certain matter. T e use of the term raises considerable issues. Whether the judge rules that the law is constitutional or unconstitutional, in both cases the court has "intervened." T e key issue, therefore, is not "intervention" or "non-intervention," but rather proportionality versus disproportionality; constitutionality or unconstitutionality. A court that leaves a limitation on a constitutional right untouched must only do so if it believes that the limitation is proportional and not because it prefers not to "intervene" in the legislator's discretion. A court holding that a certain limitation on a constitutional right is disproportional – and therefore that the legislative provision is unconstitutional – does not do so because it is "intervening" in the legislative discretion, but, rather, because it is of the opinion that the limitation is disproportional.

 **d. Judicial review and judicial deference** Courts in several jurisdictions have adopted the notion that they should defer to the decisions made by the executive 69 or legislative branches. 70 T e legal literature on

the issue of deference is vast. 71 Deference would not have been an issue had the accepted meaning of the term "deference" been that the judicial branch must respect opinions issued by the other two branches of government, and treat those decisions with all seriousness and caution. 72 Dyzenhaus dubbed this approach "deference as respect." 73 T ose requirements seem obvious, and are derived from the principle of separation of powers. 74 But the notion of deference includes more than that; it is this "addition" that poses dif culties. T is addition, as explained by

Dyzenhaus, relates more to "deference as submission." 75 Although there is no accepted legal def nition of the term deference, 76 it seems that in the present context – the proportionality of a limitation on a constitutional right – we can def ne deference as a situation where a judge adopts an opinion expressed by another branch of government (either the legislative or executive) regarding the components of proportionality when, without this expression, the judge would not have adopted that opinion. 77 T e three most common justif cations for this deference are: the lack of democratic legitimacy for judging; the lack of institutional capacity; and, f nally, judicial wisdom. 78 None of these justif cations is proper. Judging enjoys full democratic legitimacy, 79 as it is derived directly from the constitution. Similarly, the institutional structure allows the judiciary to receive information regarding the dif erent considerations in the same way this information is presented to other branches of government. Of course, the judge does not set social policy. T at assertion, however, has nothing to do with deference and everything to do with the principle of separation of powers and the scope of the court's authority within that principle. Finally, judicial wisdom cannot replace constitutional duty. T ere is no room for deference (according to the def nition herein). 80 It seems that the notion is redundant in both instances: if the opinion of the other branch – be it the legislative or executive – regarding the components of proportionality is lawful without deference, the judge should act according to it while disregarding deference; if the opinion of the legislative or executive branch regarding the components of proportionality is unlawful without deference, the judge should reject that opinion with

no relation to deference. Either way, the notion of deference should have no place; 81 it has no place when the question is the proportionality of a limitation on a constitutional right. 82 T e relevant question is the constitutionality of the opinion of the legislative or executive branch, and not the issue of deference. Accordingly, there is no room to argue that there are certain categories of cases, like national security or emergencies,83 where the judge should exercise deference to the legislative or executive authority. 84 Once again, should the opinion expressed by the legislative or executive branch fall within the "zone of proportionality," 85 then it should be adopted by the judicial branch. T is is not because the judge deferred his opinion but because the opinion is lawful.

 What is the case when both sides of the scale are of equal weight? 86 In such a case, the determination should not be based on considerations of judicial deference. One possible rule in such situations is that in case of doubt the right should prevail ( in dubio pro libertate ). Another possible rule is that when in doubt the limiting law should prevail. Either way, the rule is not based on the notion of deference.

T e approach that a judge should defer to the legislative or executive branches does not f t a constitutional democracy. It limits the principle of the separation of powers. It is a judicial tool without rules 87 or a proper legal foundation. 88 It provides the judge with discretion where discretion is unwarranted, and denies judicial discretion when it should be exercised.

### **B. Discretion and the components of proportionality**

### 1. T e decision to legislate

- i. Legislative discretion
T e legislator enjoys a very wide discretion in deciding whether or not to legislate. T e scope of such legislative discretion is one of the widest in constitutional democracies. T is expresses the very notion of representative democracy: the peoples' representatives decide whether and when they would like to regulate and whether and when they would like to refrain from doing so. However, this discretion is not absolute. T e authority to legislate is found in the constitution. T e same constitution that grants the discretion may, in certain cases, require that the legislator use it. T e same source which enabled the legislator to refrain from legislating may also require it to legislate. T us, whenever an individual has a positive constitutional right ( status positivus ) vis-à-vis the legislature, a constitutional duty to legislate ( Schutzpf icht ) is imposed on the legislature; and the decision not to legislate may limit such a right. T is argument is discussed in Chapter 15 . 89 In this context, a legislative decision not to legislate – to deny legislation on the issue – is constitutional if such a decision is proportional. However, even when a duty to legislate exists, the legislator still enjoys a very wide discretion within the bounds of that duty.

### ii. Judicial discretion

 As a rule, the courts do not demand that the legislator legislate. Importantly, however, this does not stem from the notion of judicial deference. Similarly, this approach does not render the legislative decision to legislate – or not to legislate – a non-justiciable issue. Rather, it expresses the judicial recognition that the legislative decision not to legislate is constitutionally valid. It ref ects the judicial understanding that no legal right exists for the individuals, and therefore no corresponding duty applies to the legislator, to create laws. However, there is an exception to this rule with regard to positive human rights. T e scope of that exception and the judicial discretion it provides to judges will be discussed in Chapter 15 .

### 2. Determining purposes

### i. Legislative discretion

 A legislator exercising its discretion to legislate must set its legislative purposes. T is is one of the legislator's main functions. T is is the legislator's "national responsibility" in determining the national goals and in def ning the purposes for which legislation is required. T is discretion is limited by constitutional provisions (explicit or implicit) requiring that those purposes be proper. 90T e legislator cannot choose an improper legislative purpose. T is limitation is not too dif cult to uphold. In the majority of cases, the legislator enjoys a wide discretion in determining the legislative purposes. T us, for example, the legislator can enact a law that is required, in the legislator's opinion, for national security purposes. T is is a proper purpose – so long as the proper factual framework was presented to the legislator to justify this conclusion. 91 T e factual framework should also establish the degree of urgency in achieving the legislative purpose, as well as the prognosis of its fulf llment (i.e., the probability it would actually occur). Based on this factual framework the legislator enjoys a wide discretion in determining the legislative purpose, its degree of urgency, and the probability that the purpose is actually achieved. Such a probability – the prognosis of fulf lling the purpose – falls within the legislator's wide discretion. Even if it turns out, at the end of the judicial review process, that the probability of fulf lling the statutory purpose was lower than required to justify such a limitation of the constitutional human right – a question to be examined during the proportionality stricto sensu stage of the review – this would not af ect a judicial determination as to the purpose being proper. T e purpose is proper – and its selection is well within the wide legislative discretion – even if the probability of its occurrence does not justify a limitation on the constitutional right. T e judicial purpose's appropriateness is detached from the issue of its means or the balancing between the purpose's fulf llment and the harm it may cause.

T e wide scope of the legislative discretion in determining the goals is derived from the constitution. In most cases, the constitution sets a wide parameter for legislative activity. From that premise we may also deduce that the setting of social policy should be given, among others, to the

legislator. A useful example was provided in the Israeli Supreme Court case of Stanger . 92 T ere, the Court examined whether the purpose behind the Israeli Bar Law of 1961 93 – the statute regulating the practice of law in Israel – is proper. In my opinion I wrote:

> T ere may be several models that can be used to regulate and supervise the practice of law. T e choice between those models belongs to the legislative branch. Each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. T e role of determining the proper arrangement is the legislator's as part of the notion of the separation of powers. However, this legislative discretion is bound by constitutional restraints. T ese are not politically characterized ideological restraints. A constitution is neither a capitalistic manifesto nor a socialist one … T e legislator (Knesset) is free to choose the model it sees f t when exercising its power to determine the legislation that would apply to the regulation and supervision of the practice of law. However, this freedom has its constitutional limits which should be upheld. 94

 Naturally, each constitution has its own structure. In some cases, the constitution may prefer one social or political viewpoint or another and these preferences may, in turn, impose further limitations on the "regular" legislator. In other cases, the limitations are so burdensome on the legislator that suggestions arise to amend the constitution in order to remove those limitations. At times this may also af ect the scope of existing constitutional rights. Such an amendment is not required to fulf ll the requirements of proportionality. 95 It may, however, face a claim that the amendment is unconstitutional. 96 An examination of this claim is beyond the scope of this book. 97

 In some cases, the constitution, in a special limitation clause attached to a specif c right, determines that the limitation of the right is possible if it was done to advance a special purpose. 98 Can this deny other purposes? Is that a negative solution with regard to other purposes? T e answer to this question is interpretive in nature. When the constitutional provision is interpreted as denying any other purpose, the legislator must examine in each case whether the proposed legislation falls within the zone of purposes which, according to the constitution, can be limited in order to be fulf lled. Without said special limitation, the principal rules apply. According to these rules, whenever the statute limiting the constitutional

right is meant to advance another right (whether constitutional or not), this legislation should be seen as being enacted for a proper purpose. 99 T is is not the case whenever the limiting legislation is aimed at advancing the public interest. In these types of cases the solution varies from one legal system to another. 100

### ii. Judicial discretion

 What is the judge's role in determining the legislative purposes? What is the scope of judicial discretion in those cases? T e judge's role is to examine whether the purposes chosen by the legislator satisfy the constitutional requirements of a proper purpose. 101 T e judge therefore must determine whether the content of the purpose set by the legislation, which limits a constitutional right, satisf es the requirements of the proper purpose, including the urgency requirement. Whenever a constitution is based on specif c limitation clauses, 102 the judge must interpret the constitution's specif c requirements regarding the purposes which justify a limitation on a constitutional right. T e judge must then establish whether the limiting law satisf es these requirements.

T e judge's discretion is directed towards determining the constitutionality of the purpose underlying the limiting legislation. Judicial discretion is not directed at the wisdom of the proposed legislative purpose, or at legislative consistency. T e legislator can exercise its power to legislate laws that are unwise as well as inconsistent as long as they are proportional. Issues of wisdom, ef ciency, consistency, fairness, and morality relating to the legislative purpose are pertinent only if they af ect the law's proportionality. A statute may be proportional even if the solution it proposes is unwise, inef cient, or inconsistent.

T e judge does not determine the legislative purpose. T at is chosen by the legislator. T e judge's role is to review that choice. Policy determinations are the role of the legislator; the constitutionality of the legislator's determination is for the judge to decide. 103 A useful example of this idea was of ered by the Israeli Supreme Court in the case of Gaza Coast

T e Knesset (2006, not yet published), available in Hebrew at http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les/02/270/064 / a22/02064270.a22.HTM ("We may think of several solutions that ref ect several approaches about balance and compromise between the conf icting social purposes. It is the role of the political branches to choose between those solutions. T is is not the role of the judicial branch. T e question before us is not whether other purposes could

Regional Council . 104 In that case, the Court examined legislation that formed the legal framework for the Knesset's decision to evacuate all of the Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip. In particular, the Court examined whether the purpose underlying the relevant legislation – the Law to Implement the Evacuation Plan, 2005 – was proper. T e Court was divided over that issue. T e majority opinion stated:

> T e question before us is not what we would have decided were the issues presented to us as members of the legislative body (the Knesset). We are not authorized to resolve the issue since – as this Court has been ruling ever since it was established, in hundreds of judicial opinions – we do not replace the discretion granted to the legislative (and executive) branch with our own. T e Court's examination does not relate to the wisdom or ef ciency of the legislative (or executive) decision, but only to its constitutionality or legal validity. Accordingly, we cannot rule on "who is right" in the bitterly contested issues before us. T e only question on which we are authorized to, and must, provide an answer is derived from the constitutional framework before us. And the question is this: Whether the purposes underlying the current Knesset Law are proper purposes as required by the constitutional limitation clause. 105

T e Court operates well within its "classic" role. It examines whether the purposes set by the legislator pass the constitutional threshold of proper purpose once a limitation of human rights is considered. As Rivers has noted while discussing the notion of purposes and the limitation imposed by the constitution on their scope:

be of ered, or other compromises made, that would be just as appropriate – or even more appropriate – with regard to the legislative choice. Rather, the question before us is whether the purposes chosen by the legislator – those purposes that ref ect the legislative choice on how to solve the social issue confronting it – are proper … T e question of draf ing ultra-orthodox Yeshiva students is a complex social issue of national implications and the proper forum to resolve that issue is the legislative body. T e Israeli legislator – the Knesset – has established several purposes in that context. It could have established other purposes. But the question before us today is not whether the purposes that the Knesset has established are the most appropriate purposes. T e question before us is whether the purposes established by the Knesset, operating together, fall within the range of options allowed by the legislative discretion. T e question before us is not whether the purposes chosen by the Knesset are wise and valuable. T e question before us is whether those purposes, operating together, fall within the range of proper purposes that the legislator may choose. My answer to this question is yes, regardless of my own opinion as to these purposes. We are dealing with a fundamental social issue; we are facing a complicated social policy issue. T e Knesset has the responsibility for shap-

ing such policy." (Barak, P.). 104 HCJ 1661/05 Gaza Coast Regional Council v. Knesset of Israel [2005] IsrSC 59(2) 481. 105 Ibid ., at 570.

T e function of the court is simply to f lter out those cases in which public bodies limit rights for the sake of public interest incapable ever of justifying that limitation. 106

T is approach is not based on judicial "non-intervention" or judicial deference towards the legislator. Rather, it is derived from the constitution. It is an expression of the principle of separation of powers. T e legislator enjoys wide discretion in choosing the purpose, and the judge's "nonintervention" is an expression of the constitutionality of this legislative choice. An important judicial role is to locate the legislative purpose which underlies the legislation. 107 T e legislator has determined it; the judge has to expose it. 108

### 3. Choosing the legislative means

 Once the legislator has chosen the purposes it wishes to fulf ll through the legislation, it should determine the means to achieve those goals. T e scope of the legislative discretion in selecting these means, however, is narrower than the discretion in choosing the legislative purposes. T is is because, once the purposes are selected, the means that the legislator can select from are limited to only those means that satisfy the requirements of proportionality. T e judicial role in respect of the means is to examine their proportionality. T e court does not examine which means it would have selected to fulf ll the legislative purpose were the judge a member of the legislative body; rather, the court's task is to review whether the means selected by the legislator are proportional – whether they satisfy the tests of proportionality. T e scope of the legislative discretion varies in each of the tests and the same is true for the scope of the judicial discretion. Each of these tests will now be discussed, beginning with that of rational connection.

### 4. T e rational connection test

### i. Legislative discretion

T e rational connection test determines that the means selected by the legislator should f t the purposes chosen – that is, that their use leads to the fulf llment of the legislative purpose. T e requirement is not for the complete and absolute potential of achieving each of the legislative goals,

<sup>106</sup> Rivers, above note 42, at 196. 107 See above, at 249. 108 See above, at 285.

but rather for a contribution to further those purposes – which cannot be marginal. 109 It is required that a factual framework be presented to the legislator from which one may assert the existence of a rational connection. In most cases, this requirement for a rational connection provides the legislator with considerable discretion. 110 Legislation is a forwardlooking institution. It is based on a prognosis of the occurrence of future events, as well as on evaluations of how things may – or may not – occur in the future. Moreover, the legislative purposes may be achieved, in most cases, in several ways; the probability of actually achieving the goals by these ways is not certain, but far from marginal. T e existence of several ways to achieve the same legislative purpose stems, among others, from the existence of a number of variables and the selection of any one of these – in light of the information the legislator has – would still satisfy the requirements of the rational connection test. T e choice between those elements should be lef to the legislator.

### ii. Judicial discretion

 Judicial review examines whether a rational connection exists between the law's purposes and the means selected for their fulf llment. In order to do so, the court examines the factual framework, which served as the legislative prognosis, presented to the legislator. T e court must determine, according to the test of common sense, whether this factual framework establishes the rational connection. In light of the myriad means available to advance the law's purposes as well as the many variables that may be selected by the legislator to do so, it is natural to assume that the scope of judicial discretion in these matters is extremely narrow. 111 Only when the lack of rational connection can be deduced from all of the factual data presented should the court determine that the requirements of the rational connection test have not been met. T erefore, there are very few precedents – in most legal systems – where the court has accepted the claim that no rational connection exists between the legislation and the means selected to advance its purposes. 112

### 5. T e necessity test

### i. Legislative discretion

**a. Te scope of the legislative discretion** T e necessity test requires the legislator to choose, from the variety of means available to fulf ll the legislative purposes, the means that would least harm constitutional human rights. 113 Due to this requirement, the legislator is not free to choose whichever means it considers proper; rather, it can only select those means that fulf ll the legislative purposes while harming the constitutional rights the least. Does the very existence of this legislative duty – which expresses the necessity test – coincide with the notion of legislative discretion? Should we not simply conclude that the necessity test denies the legislator's discretion in selecting the means? 114

T e answer to that question is no. T e denial of the legislative discretion occurs very rarely, if ever. T e reason for that is that the legislator determines the statutory purposes it is interested in fulf lling. T is can be determined according to its discretion, at dif erent levels of intensity. Assuming that both options satisfy the necessity test – the legislator is free to choose between any of them. 115

 Take, for example, the Israeli Supreme Court case of Adalah . 116 T ere, the legislator asserted that the statutory purpose was to mitigate, "as much as possible," the national security threat stemming from the spouses of Israeli citizens who reside in the Occupied Territories. With this assertion in mind, an individual examination could not have satisf ed the necessity test. T e legislator is permitted to determine a dif erent purpose. It can demand that the security threat should only be "somewhat" mitigated; if that were the case, an individual examination would have satisf ed the necessity test. 117T e purpose that the legislator wants to fulf ll is within its

<sup>113</sup> See above, at 317.

<sup>114</sup> Such an approach has been adopted in France in the past, where the court ruled that the necessity test should not be considered part of the judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation. See Decision No. 2007–555 DC (August 16, 2007). Recently, the French Constitutional Court has changed its approach. According to the current approach, the necessity test is now included within constitutional proportionality. See Decision No. 2008–562 (February 21, 2008); Decision No. 2009–580 (June 10, 2009). 115 See Dreier, above note 111, at 259.

Regarding the facts of the case, see above, at 351. 117 See above, at 331.

legislative discretion; and the necessity test operates within that realm of discretion. As Rivers has noted:

> [I]t does not rule out any level of achievement of any legitimate end. For example, it works even in the case of a legislature seeking near-perfect protection for national security, simply asking, given this level of national security, is privacy restricted to the least extent possible? T us it still leaves as much discretion as a legislature could reasonably want. It allows every level of achievement of every permissible end. 118

 Moreover, legislation is always forward looking. Dif erent means may fulf ll it. T us, for example, one legislative means may be more expensive, but quicker to fulf ll the legislative purpose; another may be cheaper, yet slower to achieve the same purpose. T e probability of fulf lling the purpose may also vary between one legislative means and the other. All these factors provide the legislator with considerable discretionary power; only the proper factoring of all the elements can provide an accurate picture as to the actual scope of the harm caused to the constitutional right. It is possible that this factoring may also not lead to a clear decision as to the way the legislator should choose. In this state of af airs the legislator enjoys considerable discretion. T is is the zone of legislative discretion. 119 T us, for example, the regulation and supervision of the practice of law – which limits the (constitutionally protected) right to freedom of occupation of every lawyer – may be done in several ways. T e role may be assigned to either the executive or judicial branch; an independent statutory agency may be established; the agency's structure may be determined in several ways. All these options satisfy the necessity test and the legislator can choose any one of them. 120

 **b. Te least reasonably limiting means** T e necessity test originally held that the legislator must select the means that would harm the constitutional right the least. Chief Justice Dickson of the Canadian Supreme Court used the term "as little as possible" while establishing the necessity test in Oakes . 121 Similar language was adopted in the Israeli Supreme Court case of United Mizrahi Bank : "Other means, whose limitation on

<sup>118</sup> J. Rivers, "Proportionality and Discretion in International and European Law," in N. Tsagourias (ed.), Transnational Constitutionalism: International and European Perspectives (Cambridge University Press, 2007 ). 119 See below, at 415.

<sup>120</sup> See Stanger , above note 92, at 797. 121 R . v. Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103, 134.

the human right is the smallest." 122 Since the Canadian courts f rst exercised the necessity test, however, that standard has been amended to include the reasonableness requirement. 123T us, for example, in Edwards , decided soon af er Oakes , Chief Justice Dickson noted that the limitation should be "as little as reasonably possible." 124 A similar wording of the necessity test was adopted in South Africa. 125 A similar change also occurred in Israel.

 Why was reasonableness added? 126 T e reason behind the addition of reasonableness in the present context is to identify the domain of the legislative discretion. 127 It was meant to acknowledge that, in most cases, there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of the actual achievement of the legislative purposes through the use of the means selected to do so. In many cases, this factual uncertainty prevents the legislator from pointing out a single legislative means that may fulf ll the necessity test. T us, a domain of situations, which fulf ll the legislative purposes with the least harm, is created. Within this domain, the decision to select the preferred means is the legislator's. As Justice McLachlin of the Canadian Supreme Court has noted:

> As the second step in the proportionality analysis, the government must show that the measures at issue impair the right of free expression as little as reasonably possible in order to achieve the legislative objective. T e impairment must be "minimal", that is, the law must be carefully tailored so that rights are impaired no more than necessary. T e tailoring process seldom admits of perfection and the courts must accord some leeway to the legislator. If the law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives, the courts will not f nd it overbroad merely because they can conceive of an alternative which might better tailor objective to infringement. 128

 Indeed, it is not enough to point to the means that would harm the constitutional right less than others. For such a means to satisfy the necessity test it should be shown that use of the less harmful means would not af ect the likelihood that the legislative purpose would ultimately be achieved. Of en such a probability-related, forward-looking requirement

is hard to satisfy due to evidentiary issues. Ultimately, in most instances the decision of which means to select is the result of the evaluation of several options. T ese are part of the legislator's discretion. Below are two instructive examples from the Canadian Supreme Court:

- (a) A Canadian law prescribed that, once convicted of an illegal or corrupt practice pursuant to the Elections Act, a person shall be disqualif ed from running as a candidate for of ce for a period of f ve years. It was argued that such a provision limits the constitutional right to be elected in a disproportionate manner. T e reason for that was that the f ve-year disqualif cation period does not limit the right in the least restrictive manner. T e Canadian Supreme Court assumed a limitation on the constitutional right. As for the necessity test, the Court examined the length of the disqualif cation period and ruled that the period selected by the legislator factored in the assumption that the candidate would not be able to run for of ce at the next election. Furthermore, the disqualif cation period was f xed and did not change from one election cycle to another – a choice that was intended to ensure certainty and to allow for the regaining of public trust in the fairness of the election process. T e Court held that there was no room to intervene in the legislative choice of a f ve-year disqualif cation period. Writing for the Court, Justice La Forest noted that "[t]his court has on several occasions asserted its unwillingness to secondguess the legislature in choosing between acceptable options." 129
- (b) T e Canadian Retail Business Holiday Act prohibited the sale of goods by stores on Sunday. T e act included an exception, according to which stores could open on Sunday if they were closed on Saturday, had no more than seven employees and had less than 5,000 square feet of retail space to serve the public. It was argued that the act disproportionally limited the constitutionally protected right to freedom of religion because, among others, the exception does not apply to all stores closed on Saturday. T e Canadian Supreme Court held that the act limits the right to freedom of religion. Regarding the necessity test, the Court held that the act satisf es its requirements. T e Court closely examined the parameters of the exception and compared them to a hypothetical legislative alternative that would have excluded all stores closed on Saturday. Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Dickson asserted: "I do not believe there is any magic

129 Harvey v. New Brunswick (Attorney General) [1996] 2 SCR 876, § 47.

in the number seven as distinct from, say, f ve, ten, or ff een employees as the cut-of point for eligibility for the exemption. In balancing the interests of retail employees to a holiday in common with their family and friends against the Section 2(a) interests of those af ected the legislature engaged in the process envisaged by Section 1 of the Charter. A 'reasonable limit' is one which, having regard to the principles enunciated in Oakes , it was reasonable for the legislature to impose. T e courts are not called upon to substitute judicial opinions for legislative ones as to the place at which to draw a precise line." 130

 Legislation is not an exact science. T e fulf llment of statutory purposes is always subject to uncertainty. As a result, drawing an exact line is not possible. T ere are a range of possibilities and a zone of legislative discretion. T erein, the legislator can choose from several means, all of which satisfy the requirements of the necessity test. T e choice is for the legislator alone, and the court will not substitute the legislative discretion with its own. 131T is approach is not an expression of judicial deference. Rather, it is an expression of the constitutionality of the legislative discretion and of the lack of judicial discretion.

### **c. "Only an unimaginative judge could not fnd a less restrictive means"** Justice Blackmun's well-known view on this goes as follows:

 [F]or me, "least drastic means" is a slippery slope … A judge would be unimaginative indeed if he could not come up with something a little less "drastic" or a little less "restrictive" in almost any situation, and thereby enable himself to vote to strike legislation down. 132

T is statement is correct as far as it relates to judicial imagination. However, it does not accurately ref ect the necessity test. 133 T is is for two reasons. First, Justice Blackmun does not ask the right question. We have already seen that the question to be asked by the court is not the following hypothetical question: 134 "Are there any other reasonable means that may harm the constitutional right to a lesser degree than the proposed legislation?" Rather, the question that should be asked by the court is a specif c, practical one: "Are there other means that may harm the constitutional

right to a lesser degree, but also fulf ll the legislative purpose to the same extent as the measure chosen by the legislature?" An answer to this question considers the probability of achieving the statutory purpose through the means chosen by the legislator, as well as the factual uncertainty connected to such a situation. Second, Justice Blackmun does not consider the realm of legislative discretion; he also fails to consider the possibility of several reasonable possibilities, the option of choosing from them is provided exclusively to the legislator.

### ii. Judicial discretion

 Of the options available to the legislator, which all satisfy the requirements of the rational connection test, it should choose that option which harms the constitutional right the least. T e legislator should stop at the stage of the normative "ladder" where its purpose is fulf lled, while the right suf ers the least restrictive harm. 135 T e party who argues that their constitutional right has been disproportionally limited bears the burden of showing (pleading) an alternative, which would harm the right less but which would still fulf ll the legislative purpose at the same level of intensity. 136 Once that claim has been raised, the state would bear the burden of persuading the court that such a means either does not exist or, if it does, that it cannot advance the legislative purpose to the same extent. 137 Judicial discretion in these instances is not wide. T e court should examine, based on the factual framework presented to it, whether an alternative exists that would fulf ll the legislative purpose to the same extent as the chosen legislative means, but which would also cause less harm to the constitutional right. T is decision is based, among others, on the prognosis as to the likelihood that the legislative purposes would actually be achieved while using the means chosen. In many cases, such a prognosis is a matter of uncertainty, which in turn enables the existence of several options that are likely to achieve the goal while harming the right to a lesser degree. T e choice between those options is provided to the legislator and not to the judge. 138

 Once an alternative means that would advance the legislative purposes at the same level of intensity as the means proposed by the legislator is presented to the court, the answer to the question of whether such alternative means would harm the constitutional right to a lesser or greater

extent than the means chosen by the legislator is for the court to decide. Indeed, the determination of which option is the least restrictive is the result of judicial constitutional interpretation. 139 Take, for example, a law designed to address public order issues which requires that all retail businesses shut down at a certain hour and which imposes a criminal sanction of imprisonment for failing to do so. T e legislator, in this case, avoided setting a sanction such as revoking a business license, either temporarily or permanently – thinking that the harm of such a measure to the constitutionally protected right of freedom of occupation would be greater than a criminal sanction of imprisonment. T e question of which of the two measures limits the constitutional right the least is a legal question. As such, the f nal answer to it should be provided by the court.

### 6. T e proportionality stricto sensu test (balancing)

### i. Legislative discretion

 As we have seen, the legislator enjoys considerable discretion with regard to the constitutional requirements of rational connection and necessity. What is the scope of the legislative discretion with regard to the test of proportionality stricto sensu ? T e answer is that this discretion is narrower than that of the other sub-tests. T is discretion does not include the ability to determine whether the limitation on the right in question is proportional stricto sensu ; such a determination would be made by the courts. What is lef , then, for the legislator to decide?

 Even before legislating, the legislator should examine whether the legislative purposes can be achieved through proportional means ( stricto sensu ). In most cases, the legislator has several goals and several proportional means to achieve them. T us, for example, the legislator may face the two following proportional options. In the f rst, the increase in the public benef t would not be as great but the harm caused to the constitutional right would also not be as great; in the second, the increase in the public benef t would be greater but at a cost of more harm caused to the constitutional right. Both of these options are proportional ( stricto sensu ). In this situation, the legislator has the discretion to choose between the two options. 140 Naturally, we assume that both options satisfy the requirements posed by the proper purpose, necessity, and rational connection

<sup>139</sup> See above, at 328. 140 Rivers, above note 118, at 108; Rivers, above note 42, at 191; R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]).

tests. Another situation that the legislator may face is where only one legislative option exists – which allows for a certain addition to the public security at a certain cost to the right. In this state of af airs the legislative discretion is limited only to the question of whether it should legislate or not. 141 If the legislator chooses to legislate, this can only be done if that legislative option is proportional stricto sensu .

### ii. Judicial discretion

T e role of the court is to examine whether the legislator's choice is proportional ( stricto sensu ). Once the court reaches the conclusion that the means is proportional ( stricto sensu ), it must determine it as so. T is is not an expression of judicial "non-intervention." Neither is it an expression of judicial deference to the legislator. It is simply a judicial declaration that the legislator has acted constitutionally. If the court has concluded that the means is not proportional, it should so determine it. T is is a part of its role. T e national-constitutional responsibility, as part of the principle of the separation of powers, to review the proper balance between the additional social benef t gained by fulf lling the legislative purpose and the additional harm caused to the constitutional right is ultimately in the hands of the courts. 142T e fact that the legislator was of the opinion that the balance it struck was proportional ( stricto sensu ) does not decide the case. As I noted in one national-security-related case in the Israeli Supreme Court:

> T e question is not whether the route of the Separation Fence is proportional according to the view of the military commander. T e test in this context is not a subjective examination of the views held by the military commander. T e question is not whether the military commander was of the opinion, bona f de , that the harm to the right is proportional. Rather, the test is objective. T e question is whether, according to the accepted legal standards, the route of the Separation Fence satisf es the requirements of proportionality. T is is a legal question, where the court has the professional expertise … T e military commander is the expert on the military nature of the route of the Separation Fence. We are the experts on its humanitarian aspects. T e military commander determines where the fence route should pass, either on the mountaintop or in the valley; this is his expertise. We, the judges, examine whether the harm caused by this route to the local residents is proportional. T is is our expertise. 143

<sup>141</sup> Regarding the legislator's discretion on this matter, see above, at 400.

<sup>142</sup> Jowell, above note 16, at 78, 81. 143 HCJ 2056/04 Beit Sourik Village Council v. T e Government of Israel [2004] IsrSC 58(5) 807, 845.

T is is true for all types of public interest considerations. It applies whether the considerations are of national security or are social or economic. Whatever the considerations involved, the court has to decide – according to its discretion – whether the marginal social importance of the increase in benef ts gained by the public interest is proportional to the marginal social importance of the harm caused to the constitutional right. T e judge is not an expert on national security; then again, once the pertinent considerations have been presented, they become an expert in balancing those considerations against the constitutional right.

### **C. Te zone of proportionality**

### 1. Its nature

 Legislation involves the exercise of legislative discretion. When the act of legislation (or of not legislating) limits a constitutional right, such an act must be proportional. T e requirement of proportionality does not entail the removal of legislative discretion; rather, it merely reduces it. T e legislator still enjoys a very wide discretion as to whether to legislate at all. Once the decision to legislate has been made, the legislator enjoys a wide discretion as to the legislation's purposes. T is wide discretion becomes narrower once the issue becomes the legislative means through which the purposes should be advanced. In this context, the discretion is considerably wide in selecting means that satisfy both the rational connection test and the necessity test – in other words, as long as no other option that fulf lls the legislative purpose while causing less harm to the constitutional right exists. T is discretion becomes narrower once the question becomes the proper relation between the marginal social importance of achieving that legislative goal and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right at issue (proportionality stricto sensu ).

 Accordingly, the constitutional requirement that legislation always be proportional does not eliminate legislative discretion. However, it does limit the scope of the discretion. T is reduction is not signif cant and the legislator still enjoys a very wide discretion as to the proper purposes; a considerable discretion in choosing the rational means which will fulf ll it, and in selecting the means least restrictive to the right. However, the legislative discretion regarding the proportional relation between achieving the purpose and harming the right in question is reduced.

T e conclusion which arises from this analysis is that proportionality recognizes the zones of legislative discretion which satisfy the proportionality requirements. T ese zones become smaller and smaller the further ahead the legislative process moves. T ey are most expansive during the f rst stage – when the legislator must decide whether to legislate or not – and when selecting the proper purpose. Once the purpose has been selected, expansive zones are derived from this for the selection of rational means, and signif cant zones are derived for the selection of means that are least restrictive to the human right. Once this choice is fulf lled, a rather narrow zone is derived from these zones regarding the proper relation between the marginal social importance of fulf lling the legislative purpose and the marginal social importance of preventing harm to the constitutional right.

T ese varying zones of legislative discretion are the areas in which the legislator has the leeway to operate. T is is the zone of proportionality. 144 T is is the zone of legislative discretion. 145 It is the result of the legislative discretion in deciding to legislate, in selecting the legislative purposes and the means that legally limit the constitutional right. As President Beinish of the Israeli Supreme Court has noted:

> When several options are available to the legislator and each may satisfy the requirements of proportionality, the legislator enjoys a legislative leeway dubbed by this Court "the zone of proportionality," in which the legislator may choose whatever option it sees f t. T e limits of this legislative leeway, however, are determined, in each specif c case, by the court in accordance with the nature of the interests and rights at issue. 146

T e zone of proportionality is determined in accordance with the interpretation provided by the court to the proportionality requirements. It is derived from the alternatives made available by proportionality. A legislative action taken outside the zone of proportionality entails a failure to meet the requirements of proportionality as they were interpreted by the court as part of the constitutional limitation clause. Accordingly, the zone of proportionality describes a normative reality determined by the rules of proportionality and which is derived from that reality. We should not understand the zone of proportionality as a reduction in the number of requirements demanded by proportionality. Once a legislative provision

<sup>144</sup> Compare with Gardbaum, above note 3. 145 See Rivers, above note 42, at 182. See also M. Fordham and T. de la Mare, "Identifying the Principles of Proportionality," in J. Jowell and J. Cooper (eds.), Understanding

Human Rights Principles (Portland, OR: Hart Publishing, 2001 ), 27, 83. 146 HCJ 2605/05 Academic Center of Law and Business v. Minister of Finance (2009, unpublished), available in English at: http://elyon1.court.gov.il/f les_eng/05/050/026/ n39/05026050.n39.pdf , para. 46 (Beinisch, P.).

deviates from the zone of proportionality, the law becomes disproportional as it will not satisfy one of the requirements of proportionality. T is is true whether the deviation from the zone of proportionality was signif cant or marginal.

# 2. T e zone of proportionality: legislator and judge

T e boundaries of the zone of proportionality are the lines separating the legislator from the judge: 147 "T e setting of the national policy and turning it into legislation is the role of the legislative branch; the review of the constitutionality of the legislation if it disproportionally limits constitutional human rights is the role of the judicial branch." 148 T e boundaries of the zone of proportionality are an expression of the principle of the separation of powers. T e zone of proportionality is the legislator's kingdom; keeping the boundaries intact is the judge's kingdom. Within the zone of proportionality the legislator is free to choose whether to legislate and what purpose it wishes to achieve, and to select any means it wishes to utilize in order to fulf ll that purpose. T e judge has no opinion about those choices. T e judge's only role is to maintain the boundaries of proportionality and to prevent the selection of disproportional means.

 Within the zone of proportionality, legislative discretion is at its widest when it makes a decision whether or not to legislate and at its narrowest when determining whether the means selected to advance the legislative purpose establish an appropriate relation between the purpose and the limited constitutional right (proportionality stricto sensu ). While maintaining the boundaries of the zone of proportionality, judicial discretion stands in reverse correlation to legislative discretion. T us, judicial discretion is at its narrowest when addressing the legislator's decision as to whether or not to legislate; it is at its widest when addressing the decision whether the means satisfy the requirements of proportionality stricto sensu .

 It is worth once again noting that the notion of the zone of proportionality does not ref ect an approach endorsing "non-justiciability" of legislative determinations, or the deference of the judge to the legislator. Similarly, it is not based on the assumption that a limitation is not proportional but the court will not intervene on the matter. T e opposite

<sup>147</sup> R . v. Edwards Books , above note 124, at 872. See also R. (Farrakhan) v. Secretary of State for the Home Department [2002] 3 WLR 481, 502. 148 Adalah , above note 116, at para. 78 (Barak, P.).

is true: by its very def nition, the notion of the zone of proportionality assumes that any legislative action within its boundaries is constitutional – and it is precisely for that reason that the court "intervenes" by reviewing the legislation and determining that it is constitutional. T e terminology of the zone of proportionality is derived from the notion of the separation of powers. T e court leaves intact only those limitations on constitutional rights that it f nds to be proportional; in those instances, the court does not do so because it wishes "not to intervene" or due to considerations of judicial deference, but because it is constitutional.

### **D. Margin of appreciation**

### 1. Its nature

T e European Court of Human Rights has developed the notion of the " margin of appreciation." T e term was accepted by the European Court of Justice, and from there has "migrated" to Inter-American human rights law and the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. Despite these developments, there is still no consensus in the literature as to the exact nature of the term. Arai-Takahashi def ned it as follows:

> T e term "margin of appreciation" refers to the latitude a government enjoys in evaluating factual situations and in applying the provisions enumerated in international human rights treaties. 149

T e doctrine thus provides a margin of appreciation to the national actors – the three branches of government. It is based, among others, on the notion that, while no agreement exists at the European (or international) level as to the relative social importance of the public interest or of human rights, a certain weight should be accorded to the opinion of the state against which it was argued that its legislation has disproportionally limited a human right protected by international treaties. T us,

Yourow, T e Margin of Appreciation Doctrine in the Dynamics of European Human Rights Jurisprudence (Dordrecht: Martinus Nijhof Publishers, 1996 ); G. Letsas, A T eory of Interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights (Oxford University Press, 2009 ).

for example, in Handyside , 150 the English court convicted Handyside for publishing obscene material; the obscene material consisted of the British version of "T e Little Red Schoolbook," a then-widely publicized guidebook that contained twenty-six pages on sex for schoolchildren. T e European Court of Human Rights examined whether Handyside's right to freedom of expression (which is protected by Article 10(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights 151 ) was limited disproportionally by the English courts. T e question before the Court was whether the restriction imposed by the United Kingdom satisf ed the requirements of Article 10(2)'s limitation clause. T e Court thus examined whether the English legislation was an expression of a "pressing social need" that may justify a limitation on the freedom of expression for reasons of "public morals," as determined in Article 10(2). In answering this question, the Court ruled:

> [I]t is not possible to f nd in the domestic law of the various Contracting States a uniform European conception of morals. T e view taken by their respective laws of the requirements of morals varies from time to time and from place to place, especially in our era which is characterized by a rapid and far-reaching evolution of opinions on the subject. By reason of their direct and continuous contact with the vital forces of their countries, State authorities are in principle in a better position than the international judge to give an opinion on the exact content of these requirements as well as on the "necessity" of a "restriction" or "penalty" intended to meet them … [I]t is for the national authorities to make the initial assessment of the reality of the pressing social need implied by the notion of "necessity" in this context. Consequently, Article 10 para. 2 leaves to the Contracting States a margin of appreciation. T is margin is given both to the domestic legislator ("prescribed by law") and to the bodies, judicial among others, that are called upon to interpret and apply the laws in force. 152

 Based on this view, the court decided that there was no violation of Article 10(1).

### 2. T e margin of appreciation and the zone of proportionality

T e notion of the zone of proportionality examines the constitutionality of a limitation on a human right from a national standpoint. 153 It

determines the framework of factual and normative data from which the legislator may derive a valid limitation on a human right. T e doctrine of the "margin of appreciation" examines the constitutionality of the limitation of a right from the standpoint of the international community. It determines the framework of factual and normative data whose existence allows the international community to provide considerable weight to the factual and normative determinations made by contracting state actors. Against this background, we may consider several of the similarities and dif erences between the two concepts.

 First the similarities. Both concepts deal with the factual and normative data whose existence allows for a limitation on a human right. Both deal, therefore, with the factual data on which the national law is based, as well as the prognosis of their occurrence. Similarly, the two doctrines deal with the relative importance of the marginal social benef t added by fulf lling the law's purposes in relation to the marginal social benef t of preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right.

T e dif erence between the two concepts may be seen, among others, in that the zone of proportionality deals with the factual and normative data that are relevant at the national level. T e margin of appreciation, in contrast, deals with factual and normative data relevant to international law treaties, such as the European Convention on Human Rights. 154 In some cases there are major dif erences between these legal systems. In particular, there are dif erences in the way each legal system balances the marginal social importance of the benef t to the public interest with the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right as part of proportionality stricto sensu . T e zone of proportionality ref ects this balancing as conducted within the particular national legal system. 155 It is derived from the principle of the separation of powers. T e margin of appreciation, in contrast, ref ects the line separating the discretion exercised by the state actor – the legislator, the executive, or the judge – and that of the international judge. It is not related to the principle of the separation of powers, but rather is derived from the special relationship of international law treaties (such as the European Convention on Human Rights) to the national law. Accordingly, the concept of the margin of appreciation would apply in the relations between the national judge and the international judge, while the zone of proportionality is not relevant in examining the relationship between the dif erent courts within a single legal system.

154 Rivers, above note 42, at 175. 155 See above, at 415.

 Against this background of similarities and dif erences between the two concepts, we may ask what is the proper role of the "margin of appreciation" within a national (domestic) legal system? First, the study of the concept is of major importance, as it may explain and clarify much of the international law decisions and rulings that can also apply locally. It may also contribute to the analysis of comparative law. 156 But these contributions conclude the role of the concept of margin of appreciation for the national (domestic) judge. 157 While ruling on domestic issues, the judge should only base his or her decisions on the notion of the "zone of proportionality." At the basis of such a decision is that legal system's notion of the proper balance between the public interest and individual human rights.

# Proportionality and positive constitutional rights

# **A. Positive constitutionalrights**

### 1. T e nature of positive constitutional rights

T e classic approach to constitutional rights contends that their role – as well as their original function – is to protect the individual from acts of government. 1 T ey were originally intended to prevent the government from harming individuals and therefore those rights were dubbed "negative" or rights of "inaction" ( status negativus ). T erefore, the textual expression of these rights has of en included such terms as "there shall be no limitation of …", 2 "Congress shall make no law …", 3 and everyone has the right "not to be deprived of freedom arbitrarily or without just cause." 4

 Over the years it became clear that the understanding of rights as negative was not comprehensive enough. T e need to recognize the double role the government had regarding constitutional rights was emphasized: On the one hand, it should avoid any limitation of constitutional rights; this is the negative aspect. On the other hand, that same government must protect those rights. T at is the positive aspect. T is protection has two main features. First, the government has to proactively ensure that individuals are able to exercise their constitutional rights. T us, for example, the government must protect demonstrators of political speech from a hostile crowd. 5T e second element is the state's duty to prevent other individuals from limiting constitutional rights.

<sup>1</sup> See D. Grimm, "T e Protective Function of the State," in G. Nolte (ed.), European and US Constitutionalism (Cambridge University Press, 2005 ), 138; R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]). 2

 With these understandings in mind, the recognition of positive constitutional rights ( status positivus ) began taking shape. T e content of these rights is the state's duty to actively protect the individual. T us, the wording used to express this new breed of rights included terms such as "entitled to protection …"; 6 "Marriage and the family shall enjoy the special protection of the state." 7

# 2. Positive constitutional rights in comparative law

 Today, the recognition of positive constitutional rights is widespread in constitutional democracies. 8 T e scope of that recognition varies from one constitution to another. T e most extensive recognition – which applies to all constitutional rights – can be found in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa. Article 7(2) of that Constitution states:

> T e state must respect, protect, promote, and fulf ll the rights in the Bill of Rights. 9

"Respect" refers to the state's duty not to violate constitutional rights; this is the negative aspect of the right. "Protect" refers to the protection of the said rights; this is the positive aspect of the right. 10 Finally, "fulf ll" refers to the requirement to exercise the state's duties under the existing framework of constitutional rights; for example, the duty to adopt reasonable legal measures, within the existing means, to advance the fulf llment of several social and economic rights. 11 Germany, too, recognizes positive constitutional rights ( Schutzpf icht ) as applicable to all protected constitutional rights. 12 T erefore, it is possible in both these legal systems to

examine both the negative and the positive aspects of each protected constitutional right.

 In most legal systems, however, there is no complete overlapping of the positive and negative aspects. T e basic distinction between the positive and negative aspects of a right is well recognized by most of those systems, which also recognize several positive rights. T is is the legal situation prescribed by the European Convention on Human Rights. 13 In its decisions, the European Court of Human Rights has recognized 14 a state's duty to investigate homicides; 15 to provide a suspect with explanations for their arrest; 16 to provide legal services to poor defendants; 17 to provide proper gender recognition to those who have undergone sex reassignment surgery; 18 as well as the allocation of reasonable police resources to protect information-gathering organizations from those who attempt, unlawfully and forcefully, to prevent them from fulf lling their role. 19 T e same is true for many other constitutions which recognize social and economic rights, of en framed as positive rights by the constitutions themselves. 20

 Several legal systems interpret their constitutions so as not to include positive rights. T is is the case, for example, in the United States, where the accepted interpretive approach is that the American Bill of Rights includes only negative constitutional rights. 21 T e US Supreme Court has

# 3. T e legal source of positive constitutional rights

- i. T e constitutional text and its interpretation
T e literature on positive constitutional rights is vast. One of the major contributors to this trend is the growing interest in constitutionally protected social and economic rights; these rights, in their very essence, are positive rights. Another reason for the growing interest in positive rights is the growing number of dangers posed to individual members of the community by non-state actors. T us, for example, the dangers stemming from modern technology – such as the collection of personal data by private companies – is sometimes greater than similar dangers imposed by the government itself. Moreover, the growing trend of privatization in economies across the globe of en releases states from their negative duties, in most cases without imposing similar duties on the private actor that replaces them. In order to properly protect individuals against these developments, it is necessary to recognize positive duties on the state in areas where only negative duties have previously been recognized. 24 However, to the extent that we are seeking to provide a constitutional status to those positive duties we must look for their source in the constitution. T is source could be a general constitutional provision, such as the one found in Article 7(2) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa that grants a positive constitutional aspect to all the rights included in the Constitution. 25 But, even without a general constitutional

Rights were not concerned that Government might do too little for the people but that it might do too much to them." (Posner, J.)). State constitutions may include positive rights:

provision, a positive constitutional status may be recognized through specif c provisions, such as Article 4 of Israel's Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty. 26

 What happens when the constitution contains neither a general provision relating to the positive aspect of the rights nor a specif c one? What does the "constitutional silence," in relation to the positive aspect of constitutional rights mean? Take, for example, a provision of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, according to which "all persons are free to leave Israel." 27 Obviously, the provision imposes a negative duty on the state to refrain from preventing anyone from leaving Israel; but does it also impose a positive duty upon the state to actively enable someone to leave?

T e answer to this question is interpretive in nature. As we have seen, 28 in the United States, the Supreme Court concluded that the Bill of Rights should be interpreted as containing only negative rights. T is interpretive conclusion was supported by the expressly negative language of many of the rights in the Bill of Rights (notably, "Congress shall make no law …" 29 ). But what is the answer when the wording – even in the US Constitution – is neutral, such as the right to counsel – "the accused shall enjoy the right … to have the assistance of counsel for his defense"? 30

 When a constitution contains no express provision relating either directly to positive constitutional rights or to the positive aspect of existing negative rights, the next step is to examine whether the constitution contains any relevant implied provisions. 31 T e mere fact that, in some cases, several specif c provisions include an explicit statement relating to the existence of a positive aspect of the constitutional right should not be interpreted as a "negative solution" with respect to the existence of other positive aspects of rights across the constitution. Every right should be interpreted in accordance with its own underlying reasons. 32

T us we return to the question: what is the legal source for recognizing the positive constitutional rights or their positive aspects? One answer is that the constitutional "silence" on the matter is a gap (lacuna) which requires judicial f lling. 33 T is approach would be of no use in those legal

systems where such judicial gap-f lling is not recognized. At times the positive aspects of rights may be derived from the right to equality, such as through af rmative action. 34 But what is the case when these sources are to no avail?

# ii. T e objective nature of values as a source for the positive aspect of constitutional rights

 Constitutional rights are not merely subjective rights vis- à-vis the state. T ey also constitute objective constitutional values, 35 which, in turn, may be used as a source for imposing a duty upon the state to act. 36 T us, for example, the objective value of freedom of expression imposes on the state not only the duty not to limit that freedom but also the duty to actively protect it. Similarly, the subjective constitutional right to life creates an objective value of bodily integrity, from which one may derive the conclusion that the constitutional right to life is not merely a subjective right with a negative aspect but also a right with an objective aspect. 37 Take, for example, the right to privacy. In Israel, according to Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty: "all persons have the right of privacy and intimacy." 38 T e negative aspect of the right demands that the state not take any action which would limit those individual rights. T e positive aspect of these same rights imposes a duty on the state to prevent any limitation on those rights by third parties. T is is especially true whenever the limitation is known to the state, but the state refrains from protecting privacy.

T is approach is interpretive in its essence. It can provide the wording of the constitutional rights with a positive meaning and therefore recognize the positive aspect. T is can only be applied where the wording of the constitutional right is neutral; but what happens when the constitutional text is clearly negative? How can the objective values extract a positive aspect from the negative text? Surely such values cannot create a positive constitutional right whenever such a right does not exist.

# 4. Constitutional positive aspect and constitutional positive right

 Does every positive constitutional aspect mean the existence of a positive constitutional right? Could a positive aspect be recognized without

<sup>38</sup> Art. 7(A) of Israeli Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty, above note 6.

recognizing a positive right? Take, for example, the German Constitutional Court's f rst abortion case. 39 T e German legislator had determined that, as long as the abortion was performed within the f rst twelve weeks of the pregnancy by an authorized physician and with the woman's consent, no criminal responsibility was involved. T e German Constitutional Court ruled that the law was unconstitutional in that it violated the fetus' human dignity. T us, the legislator was required to reenact the law in a way that would guarantee the fetus' human dignity by imposing proper criminal sanctions. T e petition was f led by the members of parliament as part of an abstract judicial review process. 40 T e Court's decision did not state that the fetus enjoys a constitutional right as the decision never dealt with the issue of whether or not fetuses may be the subject of legal rights and duties.

 Is this a case where the state is bound by a constitutional duty while no individual may claim an opposite constitutional right? T e answer is in the negative. Opposite the state's constitutional duty stands the individual's constitutional right. 41 A separate issue is the possible remedies for non-performance of that duty. Would the legislator's duty to legislate and the individual's constitutional right to demand this legislation be recognized? T is issue has yet to be resolved by the German courts. 42 According to my approach, the answer to this question is positive.

 Do these questions – whether a duty exists without a right, or whether there is a duty to legislate – suggest that positive constitutional rights are fundamentally dif erent – "genetically" – from negative rights? T is issue has led to an intense discussion particularly in the context of social and economic constitutional rights. It has been argued that in light of the special nature of the positive constitutional rights – in particular, the direct relationship between the state's duty and the national resources – those rights are not justiciable. 43 T e argument here was that it would be inappropriate for the judges to require the legislator to perform actions

that would change the allocation of national resources. T us, for example, the Constitution of India establishes, 44 in its fourth part, several duties to be imposed on the state; it then states that these duties are not enforceable by any court. 45 T is is not the only approach. Many legal systems do recognize positive constitutional rights – either social, economic, or others – as well as their justif ability. T ose rights suf er no genetic defect. However, they do, at times, justify a special attitude by the state. One of the instances where such a special attitude is required by positive constitutional rights is the application of the constitutional rules of proportionality. T is application will now be discussed.

# **B. Positive constitutionalrights and proportionality's components**

### 1. Positive rights as relative rights

 Positive constitutional rights are, like the majority of negative constitutional rights, relative rights. 46 T us, avoiding a positive constitutional duty – much like imposing a limitation on a negative right – does not automatically render the omission unconstitutional. T e omission is unconstitutional and one could move on to the stage of constitutional remedies, only where the omission is disproportional. Indeed, the two-stage model 47 applies to positive constitutional rights as well. During the f rst stage we examine whether the omission by the state actor limits the constitutional right. If the answer to this question is yes, we proceed to examine, during the second stage, whether the omission was justif ed. T e rules of proportionality determine whether such a justif cation exists.

T e determination that an omission is disproportional in relation to a positive right is reached much in the same way as the determination that a limitation on a negative right was disproportional. First, one has to establish the scope of the positive constitutional right in question. T at task is achieved through the process of constitutional interpretation, and the rules of constitutional interpretation apply. 48 T e positive constitutional

<sup>44</sup> See Constitution of India, Chapter 4, Arts. 36–51.

<sup>45</sup> Ibid . Art. 37 ("T e provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable by any court, but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the State to apply these principles in making laws."). 46 Regarding relative rights, see above, at 32.

<sup>47</sup> Regarding the two-stage model, see above, at 19.

<sup>48</sup> See above, at 45.

right, much like the negative one, is interpreted from a generous viewpoint. 49 T e scope of the positive constitutional right may conf ict with the scope of another constitutional right – whether positive or negative. T e resolution of the conf ict is not through the limitation of the scope of the positive constitutional right; rather, the solution is found at the subconstitutional level (a statute or the common law). 50

T e examination of a limitation on a negative right does not proceed to the second stage unless it is f rst established that the limitation was imposed "by law." T is is an application of the principle of legality: a "chain of authorization" must be established all the way up to the constitution. 51 Do the same requirements apply to positive rights? T e answer to this question is yes. In order for the legislator's omission (in protecting the positive right) to be justif ed, this justif cation must be based upon a legal provision, which is "by law." If the positive rights were limited by the state without any legislative provision, the state would be unable to justify its omission. 52 T us, the limitation clause is able to provide a justif cation to the state's omission only where that omission is not complete (i.e., a complete evasion of the duty to protect the right) but rather partial (i.e., some protection was of ered but, according to the argument, it is insuf cient).

 Assuming the omission limits a positive constitutional right in accordance with a law – and the burden falls on the party so arguing 53 – then the constitutional review moves to the second stage, that of justif cation. Here, the burden lies with the party arguing for this justif cation. 54 T at party must present the factual framework that would allow the court to conclude that the inaction of the relevant state actor, in these circumstances, was proportional. T is issue will now be examined.

### 2. T e proper purpose component

T e examination of proportionality regarding the omission in fulf lling the positive constitutional right begins with the purpose component.

<sup>49</sup> See above, at 69. 50 See above, at 89. 51 See above, at 108. 52 See S. Liebenberg, "T e Interpretation of Socio-Economic Rights," in S. Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa , 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 55; S. Woolman and H. Botha, "Limitations," in S.Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa , 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 60; President of the Republic of South Africa v. Modderklip Boerdery (Pty) Ltd ., 2005 (5) SA 3 (CC); August v. Electoral Commission , 1999 (3) SA 1 (CC). 53 See below, at 437. 54 See below, at 439.

Much like in negative rights, 55 positive rights, too, require that the limitation be done to advance a proper purpose. T e question is whether the reason for not protecting the constitutional right is proper. T is examination is conducted according to the same criteria that guide the examination of a limitation on negative rights. T us, for example, if the only reason of ered for the omission is a desire not to protect the right in question, this is not a proper purpose. But, if the reason was either to protect the rights of others or to protect national security interests – these could serve as proper purposes, so long as the proper factual framework has been laid to establish the degree of urgency of the omission as well as its prognosis. Every legal system has its own proper purpose tests. T us, the prevention of the limitation of a negative right is a proper purpose for not having protected a positive right.

T e legislative omission should be examined in accordance with the proper purpose test only if the omission is "partial" – that is, there is a legislative provision designed to protect the positive right, but this legislation is not suf ciently protective. When no legislation exists, its absence cannot be justif ed. T e move to the justif cation stage – e.g., the justif cation relating to the proper purpose – occurs only when a legislative provision protecting the constitutional right exists, but the claim is that this legislation is not enough and therefore limits the positive constitutional right disproportionally. T e party arguing that the omission is constitutional must show that the avoidance of taking further steps to protect the positive right was for a proper purpose. T e scope of the discretion granted to the legislator in this context is very wide: it applies both to the question of whether to enact further legislation at all, as well as to the question of the proper purpose of the said legislation, and what means should be selected to fulf ll it. 56

T e judicial discretion in these matters is extremely narrow. 57 T is is true both for judicial discretion in examining the question of whether the legislator should have enacted additional legislation at all and in reviewing the issue of the appropriateness of the legislative purposes. T is narrow judicial discretion is not the result of judicial deference to the legislator; 58 rather, the scope of the judicial discretion is directly derived from the wide discretion granted to the legislator. With regard to the negative rights,

- 56 See Grimm, above note 1, at 150.
- 57 See above, at 403.
- 58 Regarding judicial deference, see above, at 396.

<sup>55</sup> See above, at 245.

the limitation can be prevented by simply avoiding such legislation; with regard to positive rights, an elimination of the legislative omission may be obtained in many ways. T e choice between those is in the hands of the legislator, and well within its discretion. 59

### 3. T e rational connection component

T e rational connection test that applies in the context of negative rights applies to positive rights as well. In both cases, the means selected by the legislator must f t the chosen purposes. 60 T ere is no need to prove certainty as to the completion of the purposes. All that is required is to prove more than a minimal probability that the purposes will be fulf lled, even if only partially. 61 In the context of positive rights, the requirement is for a rational connection between the insuf cient legislation (the "relative" or "partial" omission) and the proper purpose underlying the insuf cient legislation. 62 In most cases, this requirement is not too dif cult to satisfy. In some cases, however, avoiding the protection of the constitutional right does not contribute to the fulf llment of the proper purpose. Take, for example, the South African case of Treatment Action Campaign . 63 In that case, decided in the Constitutional Court of South Africa, the state violated its positive duty to take reasonable steps to ensure medical services within its f nancial means. 64T is was expressed, for example, in that the state refused to accept as a gif drugs that could prevent the infection of children with the HIV virus from their mothers. Such an omission, the South African Constitutional Court ruled, cannot satisfy the requirement of a rational connection since it cannot fulf ll, in any way, the proper purpose.

T e legislator enjoys a considerable discretion regarding the rational connection component; this is true for negative rights 65 and positive rights. T e judicial discretion here is extremely limited; this is true for both negative rights 66 and positive rights.

### 4. T e necessity component

T e necessity component imposes on the legislator the duty to select from all the means available to advance the proper purpose – those that would advance that purpose while least limiting the constitutional right. 67 T e necessity test imposes, on the legislator, the duty to choose a hypothetical legislative alternative that would advance the legislative purpose to the same degree, while limiting the constitutional rights less. T is test operates regarding both negative and positive rights. Accordingly, to satisfy this test, there should be no possible alternative which would fulf ll the proper purposes to the same extent while providing better protection to the positive constitutional right. If that additional protection of the positive constitutional right requires the additional limitation of the (negative) rights of others or the limitation of the public interest beyond what is required by the legislator (as stated by the proper purpose), then the test has been satisf ed. Much like negative rights, the same is true for positive rights: the legislative discretion is considerable. It determines the proper means.

### 5. T e proportionality stricto sensu component

 Proportionality stricto sensu is a balancing component. 68 It balances between the marginal social importance to the public interest or another constitutional right gained by fulf lling the legislative purpose against the marginal social importance of the prevention of the harm to the constitutional right. T e basic rule of balancing states that the more important the prevention of the marginal harm to the constitutional right and the greater the probability of its occurrence, then it is required that the marginal benef ts to the public interest or to another constitutional right must be of greater social importance and more urgency and the probability of their occurrence must be greater. 69

T is basic rule of balancing also applies in balancing the fulf llment of the public interest or another constitutional right and the non-fulf llment of the positive constitutional right. T us, in its positive form, the basic balancing rule requires that the more important the marginal protection

- 68 See above, at 343.
- 69 See above, at 362.

of the positive constitutional right and the greater the chances of fulf lling that right, then the requirement that the marginal benef ts to the public interest or to another constitutional right by avoiding the enactment of legislation should be more socially important and more urgent, and the probability of their occurrence greater.

 An example of the application of the proportionality stricto sensu component to positive rights can be found in the German Constitutional Court's f rst abortion case. 70T ere, the Court reviewed a law that provided, among others, that there is no criminal responsibility involved when an abortion is performed during the f rst twelve weeks of the pregnancy, by a certif ed physician, and with the consent of the pregnant woman. T e Court held that the law limited the protection granted by the Basic Law to the life of a person in accordance with Article 2(2) of the Basic Law. 71 T is limitation was meant to enable the pregnant woman to practice her right to freely develop her personality in accordance with Article 2(1). 72 T e Court then balanced the social importance of taking action to protect the life of the fetus and the social importance of allowing the mother to freely develop her personality. 73 T e Court concluded that the protection of the life of the fetus was more important, and therefore ruled:

> In the ensuing balancing process … the decision must come down in favor of the preeminence of protecting the fetus' life over the right of self-determination of the pregnant woman. Pregnancy, birth, and childrearing may impair the woman's [right of self-determination] as to many personal developmental potentialities. T e termination of pregnancy, however, destroys prenatal life. Pursuant to the principle of carefully balancing competing constitutionally protected positions … [the state] must give the protection of the unborn child's life priority. 74

T at decision was later revised. 75 However, the principle regarding the application of proportionality stricto sensu as to the omission of adequately protecting such a right – has not changed.

# T e burden of proof

### **A. Te issue presented**

 A petitioner argues before the court 1 that a constitutional right was disproportionally limited by law. Who bears the burden of proof in this matter? T is issue does not relate to proving the law. Rather, it is related to proving the facts upon which the claim – that the right has been disproportionally limited – rests. T e question relates to issues of the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence. T e constitutional approach is based upon the two-stage model. 2 At the f rst stage, the question examined is, when a constitutional right has been limited, who bears the burden during this stage? Does the burden lie with the party arguing that the right has been limited, 3 or with the party claiming no such limitation has occurred? 4 At the second stage, the question is whether such a limitation is justif ed, and therefore valid. T e answer to that question lies within the rules of proportionality in the limitation clause. Who bears the burden of proof (both the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing the evidence) during this stage? Does it lie with the party arguing for the justif cation, or with the party arguing that no such justif cation exists?

<sup>1</sup> In most cases, issues of burden of proof arise in "vertical-type" litigation where an individual f les a claim against a state actor. However, the same type of issues may arise in more conventional, "horizontal-type" litigation where an individual brings a suit against another individual or a corporation in a civil court. In Israel, the seminal United Mizrahi Bank case was the of the latter type, where a bank was sued in a civil court. See CA 6821/93 United Mizrahi Bank Ltd . v. Migdal Cooperative Village [1995] IsrLR 1. 2

See above, at 26.

<sup>3</sup> Note that the person who makes that argument is most likely the person whose right was limited, but it could also be another person who has standing.

### **B. Te burden of proof: facts and law**

T e burden of proof plays a role regarding the facts. It is irrelevant regarding legal issues. T e court knows the law ( iura novit curia ). One can argue that the "burden of proof" on issues of law rests with the court itself, as in the old Latin saying: "Just provide me with the facts, and I will provide you with the law" ( da miti facta, dato tibi ius ). Further, the court cannot "pass on" its "burden" to any of the parties. T e burden of proof issue is not relevant in the context of whether the limited right is constitutionally protected or not. T is is an issue of law, and therefore the notion of burden of proof does not apply. T e same is true regarding the right's scope and the interpretation of the legislative provision that, according to the argument, has limited the right. Similarly, the burden of proof plays no role in deciding whether a limitation on a right occurred "by law," 5 or whether the purpose, according to which the right has been limited, is proper or not. 6 All these issues are matters of law, relating either directly to the constitutional interpretation of the limitation clause or to the statutory interpretation of the legislative provision that has limited the constitutional right. In matters of legal interpretation, the notion of the burden of proof plays no role. T erefore, the issue of burden of proof is not raised in relation to the interpretation of constitutional provisions relating to proportionality. T e scope of these and similar provisions are a matter for the court.

 When does the notion of the burden of proof become relevant in these matters? T e burden is relevant whenever the application of the law is predicated on a fact. T us, for example, the very notion of a limitation on a constitutional right requires a limitation. T e term "limitation" is a legal term 7 whose interpretation and scope are matters for the court, and therefore there is no application of the burden of proof; the actual events that led to the result of the argued limitation are issues of fact, and, therefore, the burden of proof applies. Similarly, proportionality is a matter of law; therefore, there is no application of issues of the burden of proof. T en again, the events that lead to the conclusion that the limitation has been proportional – these events are matters of facts, where the burden of proof is applicable.

T is chapter does not deal with legal interpretation, but rather with proving facts. In particular, this chapter deals with the burden of proof within these facts. Who bears that burden? Does it lie with the party

<sup>5</sup> See above, at 107. 6 See above, at 245. 7

See above, at 101.

arguing that a limitation has occurred, or with the person arguing that no such limitation has occurred? Does the burden lie with the party arguing for a justif cation of the said limitation, or with the party arguing that no such justif cation exists?

# **C. Te burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence**

T e term "burden of proof" or "onus of proof" is an aggregate term that consists of two separate burdens: the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence. T e burden of persuasion is the burden of one party to persuade the court that the facts presented entitle that party to a right claimed against the other party. T e question of whether that party has lif ed the burden of persuasion is examined at the end of the judicial process. If, at the end of the process, the two ends of the factual scales are completely balanced, then the party who brought the suit has failed to lif the burden of persuasion. T e burden of producing evidence, in contrast, may shif from one party to the next during the judicial process; this is the burden of producing the facts and presenting them to the court.

## **D. Te frststage of constitutionalreview: a limitation of a constitutionalright**

T e f rst stage examines the limitation on the constitutional right. Such an examination requires two separate inquiries. T e f rst relates to the scope of the constitutional right at issue: what are its boundaries, what is included in the right, and what is external to it. T is inquiry relates to the interpretation of the constitutional right in accordance with the rules of constitutional interpretation. 8 T is is an inquiry of a legal nature and the issue of the burden of proof plays no part. T e second examination is whether the law has limited a constitutional right. T is inquiry requires, naturally, the limiting law to be provided with a meaning. T is is carried out through the rules of statutory interpretation. 9 T is too is for the court to decide. However, the second inquiry is not limited to an interpretation of the limiting law. It also contains the issue of the limitation itself, namely, whether the law has actually limited the constitutional right. "Limitation"

<sup>8</sup> See above, at 45.

<sup>9</sup> On statutory interpretation, see A. Barak, Purposive Interpretation in Law (Sari Bashi trans., Princeton University Press, 2005), 339.

in this context means that the owner of the right is unable to exercise the right to its fullest extent, that is, to the extent it would be available should the limitation not occur. 10 T e decision that a limitation actually took place must be based on a comparison between the constitutional text (relating to the right's scope) and the limiting law (relating to the limitation's scope). When the comparison is of an abstract nature – sometimes referred to as an "abstract review" – these are the only components of the comparison. In many constitutional democracies, however, most of the judicial comparisons are not merely abstract; rather, they are of a concrete nature – these are concrete reviews, based on the occurrence of a concrete (alleged) limitation. 11 T is concrete limitation, in turn, is based on a specif c set of facts. Who, then, bears the burden of proof (i.e., both the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence) regarding the existence of facts which establish the existence of a concrete limitation on a constitutional right? T e answer is that, during the f rst stage of the constitutional review, the burden of proof lies with the party claiming that such a limitation has occurred. As Justice Ackerman of the South African Constitutional Court has noted:

> T e task of interpreting … fundamental rights rests, of course, with the courts, but it is for the applicants to prove the facts upon which they rely for their claim of infringement of a particular right in question. 12

Similarly, I noted in the Israeli case of United Mizrahi Bank :

 It seems that there is no dispute over the proposition that at the f rst stage of the constitutional review – establishing that a limitation on a constitutional human right has occurred – the burden of persuasion lies with the party arguing that such a limitation has occurred. T e presumption is that the legislative provision is constitutional … T e party seeking to refute that presumption bears the burden of doing so. 13

<sup>10</sup> See above, at 101.

<sup>11</sup> On abstract review, concrete review, and the comparison between them, see L. Favoreu, "Constitutional Review in Europe," in L. Henkin and A. J. Rosenthal (eds.), Constitutionalism and Rights: T e Inf uence of the United States Constitution Abroad (New York: Columbia University Press, 1990); A. Brewer-Carias, Judicial Review in Comparative Law (Cambridge University Press, 1989 ); V. Ferreres Comella, Constitutional Courts and

(Cape Town: Juta Law Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–), 3–7. 13 See United Mizrahi Bank , above note 1, at para. 84.

T is approach 14 is based on the view that the party initiating a claim against another should prove his argument. It may, of course, be based on the special approach regarding the presumption of constitutionality that applies on every law; 15 that presumption places the burden of proof on the party arguing that the limitation of their constitutional right exists.

# **E. Te second stage of constitutionalreview: justifcation of the limitation of a right**

# 1. T e elements which make up the justif cation of the limitation of a right

T e second stage of the constitutional review focuses on the existence – or lack thereof – of a justif cation for the limitation on the right. T e basic approach is that human rights found in the constitution are not "absolute"; rather, they are relative. 16 T ey may be limited. T is limitation is constitutional only if it has a legal justif cation. T e justif cation is found in the rules of proportionality, which are a part of the limitation clause. 17 T e question we now face is who bears the burden of establishing the different components of proportionality. T is question relates only to the factual aspects of these components. T e question did not create many dif culties in most legal systems. It has been established that the burden of proof (both the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence) lies with the party arguing for the justif cation. 18

# 2. Comparative analysis

- i. Canada
T e human rights in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms are usually formulated in absolute terms. T us, for example, Section 2 of the Charter reads:

<sup>14</sup> P. W. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada , 5th edn., vol. II (Toronto: T omson Carswell, 2007), 117; S. Woolman and H. Botha, "Limitations," in S.Woolman, M. Bishop, and J. Brickhill (eds.), Constitutional Law of South Africa , 2nd edn. (Cape Town: Juta Law

Publishers, looseleaf, 2002–). 15 Regarding that presumption, see below, at 444.

<sup>16</sup> See above, at 27.

<sup>17</sup> Regarding the limitation clauses, see above, at 141.

<sup>18</sup> See below, at 439–444.

Everyone has the following fundamental freedoms:

- (a) freedom of conscience and religion;
- (b) freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, including freedom of the press and other media of communication;
- (c) freedom of peaceful assembly; and
- (d) freedom of association.

T e relative nature of those rights, that is, the constitutional ability to lawfully limit them, stems from the general limitation clause appearing in Section 1 of the Charter:

> T e Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society.

 By virtue of this constitutional structure – rights phrased as "absolute" and the general limitation clause which turns them into "relative" rights – the Canadian case law has deduced the notion of a two-stage constitutional review. It is agreed that the party arguing that a limitation has occurred bears the burden of proof during the f rst stage. But who bears the burden during the second stage of the constitutional review? T e question was raised and decided in the Oakes case. 19 As Chief Justice Dickson wrote:

> T e onus of proving that a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter is reasonable and demonstrably justif ed in a free and democratic society rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation . It is clear from the text of Section 1 that limits on the rights and freedoms enumerated in the Charter are exceptions to their general guarantee. T e presumption is that the rights and freedoms are guaranteed unless the party invoking Section 1 can bring itself within the exceptional criteria which justify their being limited. T is is further substantiated by the use of the word "demonstrably" which clearly indicates that the onus of justif cation is on the party seeking to limit. 20

Oakes is good law in Canada in that respect; all Canadian courts act according to it. 21 T e same approach is followed in New Zealand. 22

# ii. South Africa and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights

T e Bill of Rights of the 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South African is based upon the two-stage doctrine. Who bears the burden during the second stage? T e South African Constitutional Court has ruled that the burden of proof – both the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence – lies with the party arguing for the existence of a justif cation. 23

 A similar approach was adopted by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights of 1966. 24 According to Article 12 of the Siracusa Principles on the Limitation and Derogation of Provisions in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1984), the "burden of justifying a limitation upon a right guaranteed under the Covenant lies with the state." 25

# iii. European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms

T e European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 26 is mostly based upon the two-stage doctrine. T us, for example, Article 8(1) (right to respect for privacy and family life), Article 9(1) (freedom of thought, conscience, and religion), and Article 10(1) (freedom of expression) def ne the rights included therein. T e concomitant provisions – Articles 8(2), 9(2), and 10(2), respectively – are special limitation

T e weighing up exercise is ultimately concerned with the proportional assessment of competing interests but, to the extent that justif cation rests on factual and/or policy Considerations, the party contending for justif cation must put such material before the Court."

clauses stating that those rights may not be limited unless such limitations are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society; the special limitation clauses also prescribe the special social values that should be protected in the case of such limitations (such as the "interests of public safety," "the protection of public order, health or morals," or "the protection of the rights and freedoms of others").

 According to the accepted view, once the party has met the burden of proof as to the limitation of the right (f rst stage), the burden is shif ed to the other party to justify this limitation, in accordance with Articles 8(2), 9(2), and 10(2) (second stage). 27 In that respect, the distinction between the burden of persuasion and the burden of production of evidence plays no role.

### iv. England

 In 1998, the United Kingdom adopted the Human Rights Act. T e Act incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms into UK law. T e Act states (in section 4) that, whenever a court is satisf ed that a provision of primary legislation is incompatible with a Convention right, it may make a declaration of incompatibility. T e Act goes on to establish a review process based on the two-stage doctrine. T e burden lies, f rst, with the party arguing that their right was limited. Once that burden has been met, the burden of justif cation shif s to the party arguing that such a limitation is compatible with the provisions of the Human Rights Act. 28

### **F. Te burden of persuasion during the second stage: on the party claiming the existence of a justifcation forthe limitation**

### 1. T e burden of persuasion and the status of human rights

 In the absence of explicit legislative provisions, the rules relating to the burden of persuasion are based on case law. T ey are designed to provide an answer to the question of who should bear the consequences of not

<sup>27</sup> See Kokott, above note 4, at 230, 232.

<sup>28</sup> See M. Supperston and J. Coppel, "Judicial Review af er the Human Rights Act," 3 Eur. Hum. Rts. L. Rev . 301, 326 ( 1999 ); M. Fordham and T. De La Mere, "Identifying the Principles of Proportionality," in J. Jowell and J. Cooper (eds.), Understanding Human Rights Principles (Oxford: Hart Publishing, 2001 ), 27; A. Kavanagh, Constitutional Review under the UK Human Rights Act (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 254; A. Lester and D. Pannick, Human Rights Law and Practice , 2nd edn. (London: Butterworths, 2004 ),

persuading the court, at the end of the proceedings, of the correctness of the claim. T e examination of this case law through a comparative perspective shows that no universal rule has been adopted in this context. Moreover, according to Wigmore, a universal rule regarding the burden of persuasion is not merely non-existent, but also cannot exist:

> T e truth is that there is not and cannot be any one general solution for all cases. It is merely a question of policy and fairness based on experience in the dif erent situations. 29

 Similarly, James, Hazard, and Leubsdorf have agreed that no a priori test exists in that context; the burden is determined according to considerations of policy, fairness, and convenience. 30

 In examining the issue of the burden of persuasion regarding the justif cation of a limitation of constitutional rights, the decisive factor is the protection of human rights. Indeed, constitutional democracies are designed to protect human rights 31 and the protection of human rights is the function of constitutions in general and the bill of rights contained therein in particular.

T e realization of this duty is expressed in dif erent ways. One way is to impose the burden of persuasion to justify a limitation on a constitutional right on the party arguing for the existence of this justif cation. T us, if at the end of the day the scales are balanced, and the facts presented for and against a justif cation are of equal weight, all that remains is the constitutional limitation itself. If, indeed, the main purpose of a constitutional democracy is the protection of human rights, this concern should also be ref ected in the case of a factual tie. T us, at the end of the day, once the factual scales are balanced, the court should rule against the limitation on the right and not in its favor. 32

 Alongside this fundamental notion of judicial policy are several other considerations of fairness and convenience. T e factual data used to justify the limitation of constitutional rights are found, in most cases, with governmental authority which is the typical respondent in these types of cases. T e legislative branch is presented with – or at least should be

91: "Where the right is not absolute but is subject to exceptions, it is for the respondent to

show that there is a justif cation for a prima facie breach." 29 See J. H. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (Boston: Little Brown & Co. 1981 ),

<sup>§§ 2487–2488. 30</sup> See F. James, G. C. Hazard, and J. Leubsdorf, Civil Procedure , 5th edn. (Foundation Press, 2001 ), 421; J. W. Strong (ed.), McCormick on Evidence , 6th edn. (West Publishing Co., 2006 ), 565. 31 See above, at 218. 32 See above, at 365.

presented with – those factual f ndings that may justify the limitation in a concrete case on a human right. T e individuals directly harmed by that limitation – and who claim that their right has been unduly limited – have no appropriate tools, in most cases, to gather that information and to present it to the court.

### 2. T e counter-argument: the presumption of constitutionality

- i. T e burden of persuasion: on the party arguing against constitutionality
T e foundation on which the approach that the burden of persuasion relating to the justif cation of the limitation on a constitutional right lies with the party arguing in favor of such justif cation rests with the notion that in a constitutional democracy, constitutionally protected rights are of the utmost importance. Against this argument one may argue that the constitution itself is equally important. T e importance of the constitution may be expressed, among others, by the presumption of constitutionality. According to that presumption, every legislative provision is presumed to be validly enacted within the powers granted by the constitution. Such a presumption is also the reason behind the unanimously accepted notion33 that during the f rst stage of the constitutional review – when the argument that a right has been limited is presented – the burden of persuasion lies with the party arguing that a limitation has occurred. T e claim is that such constitutional logic should not stop at the f rst stage; it should also apply to the second stage, in which the justif cation claim is raised. T e argument, then, is that the presumption of constitutionality should apply to all stages of the constitutional review. Accordingly, there is no point in distinguishing between the limitation-on-the-right stage and the justif cation-for-that-limitation stage; both stages should be treated as one for the purposes of the burden of proof. Is that the correct approach?

- ii. On the presumption of constitutionality
 It is of en said that constitutional democracies adopt the presumption of constitutionality. 34 T e presumption applies in several contexts. T e

<sup>33</sup> See above, at 437.

<sup>34</sup> See J. Eliot Magnet, "T e Presumption of Constitutionality," 18 Osgoode Hall L. J . 87 ( 1980 ); H. Burmester, "T e Presumption of Constitutionality," 13 Fed. L. Rev . 277 ( 1983 ); A. S. Butler, "A Presumption of Statutory Conformity with the Charter," 19 Queens L. J . 209 ( 1993 ).

most important of these is the interpretive context. 35 T us, the presumption of constitutionality is a part of the objective purpose of each legislative provision. 36 Accordingly, a presumption is that the law's purposes do not conf ict with the constitution. 37 If the interpreter faces two plausible interpretations, according to which one is constitutionally valid and the other is not, the interpreter must choose the constitutionally valid interpretation. As Justice Lamer of the Canadian Supreme Court has noted:

> [T is] Court … should not … interpret legislation that is open to more than one interpretation so as to make it inconsistent with the Charter and hence of no force or ef ect. 38

 Another context where the presumption of legality applies is in the constitutional review of legislative provisions, in particular those cases where the legal issue may be resolved through the interpretive process. Here, the approach is that in those cases where the court can resolve the legal issue through interpretation it should do so rather than use the more extreme measure of declaring the law unconstitutional. T is preference is based on the presumption of constitutionality. 39T is interpretive approach leads to a situation where the constitutionality of the legislative provision remains intact – or, in other words, the law is "saved" – through use of the interpretive process. 40

T e third context in which the presumption of constitutionality is said to apply is that of a burden of persuasion in relation to facts demonstrating the unconstitutionality of a law. Here, too, there is no dispute as to the application of the presumption with regard to demonstrating the facts on which the limitation on the constitutional right is based. T e only doubt is in relation to the application of the presumption to proving the facts on which the justif cation for such a limitation is based. Should the presumption apply in this context?

### iii. T e presumption of constitutionality and the justif cation of the limitation of constitutional rights

T e presumption of constitutionality cannot be properly used to justify the imposition of the burden of persuasion with the party arguing against

<sup>35</sup> See Hogg, above note 14, at 117.

the existence of a justif cation for the limitation on a constitutional right. T e reason for that is the central status of the protection of human rights within a constitutional democracy. T is central status should justify the conclusion that the presumption has fulf lled its role once the burden of persuasion has been imposed on the person arguing that a limitation occurred during the f rst stage of the review. It is not appropriate – from the standpoint of the constitutional protection of human rights – to continue to impose that burden on the same party, now arguing that no justif cation exists for the limitation it proved earlier. 41 T is is even more so in cases where the law in question preceded the constitution, and the presumption of constitutionality is artif cial in the context of evidentiary burdens. T e presumption of constitutionality is, therefore, the presumption of the non-limitation of the constitutional right; it does not apply to the matter of the justif cation of the limitation.

 As we have noted, the presumption of constitutionality's existence is undisputed. It is the scope of the presumption's application that raises doubts. T e presumption of constitutionality is judge-made law. T erefore, whenever it is not appropriate to apply the presumption, it should not be applied. One of those situations is whenever a limitation on a constitutional right is at issue. In these cases, the person arguing that the limitation is constitutionally justif ed must present the court with the factual framework upon which such an argument is based. In contrast, the presumption may well be applied to justify the imposition of a burden on the party arguing that their constitutional right has been limited, such that this party would be required to present the factual framework supporting this claim to the court. Once such a factual framework has been established, the burden has been lif ed. Now the burden shif s to the party arguing that a justif cation exists for imposing such a limitation; that party must present the court with the factual framework upon which such justif cation rests. T e presumption of constitutionality would be of no support at this stage. It has already been rebutted. It may only be of assistance during the f rst stage. Once that stage has been exhausted, so has the presumption.

<sup>41</sup> See Hogg, above note 14, at 120: "In Charter cases, the constitutional contest is between a government and an individual, who asserts that a right has been violated. In that context, it is not appropriate to tilt the scale in favor of the government. T ere should be no special obstacle placed in the way of an individual who seeks to vindicate a Charter right."

## **G. Te burden of producing evidence during the second stage: on the party arguing that the limitation is justifed**

### 1. T e basic approach

T e basic approach is that, during the second stage of the constitutional review – the stage relating to the justif cation for limiting the constitutional right – there is no point in distinguishing between the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence. Both burdens lie with the same party – the one arguing that the limitation has been justif ed. T is approach is based on the central status of human rights, as well as on the access advantage the state enjoys to the factual data that may justify the means chosen and on the state's special status as a party to the legal proceedings within public law.

## 2. T e burden during the second stage and the status of human rights

 Once the burden has been lif ed during the f rst stage of the constitutional review, and the party arguing that a constitutional right has been limited has presented the court with a proper factual framework to support that claim, it is appropriate that the party arguing that a justif cation exists for such a limitation should be required to bear the burden of proof. In this context, there is no point in distinguishing between the burden of persuasion and the burden of producing evidence. 42 T is approach is based, f rst and foremost, on the constitutional value of protecting human rights. If we are interested in providing this value with the proper treatment, it is necessary that the party that has limited the constitutional right justify that limitation. T e imposition of the said burden – be it the burden of persuasion or the burden of producing evidence – on the person claiming the lack of a justif cation devalues the constitutional protection of those rights.

T is general argument, which applies both to the burden of persuasion and to the burden of producing evidence, is reinforced due to the following claim, unique to the burden of producing evidence when the defendant is the state. T e state, which legislated the law limiting the constitutional right, possesses all the information required to present a factual framework to the court justifying the limitation. We may therefore

42 See above, at 437.

reasonably assume that the state was in possession of that same information at the time the legislation was adopted. In any event, it cannot be disputed that the state enjoys much better access to the information than any party claiming that their right has been limited. T erefore, we should not demand that the party – whose constitutional right has been limited and who has presented the court with the factual framework supporting that claim – now brings evidence to persuade the court that such a limitation has no justif cation. Of en that party has no access, within their available means, to information that may support the existence – or non-existence – of such a justif cation. Furthermore, in most cases the justif cation – if it exists – was made with the full knowledge of the state, which limited the constitutional right, since the limitation was based on that justif cation in the f rst place. Accordingly, it is appropriate that the burden of producing evidence of the justif cation of the limitation be imposed on the state that has limited the constitutional right. 43

### 3. T e burden of producing evidence and the burden of the claim that there is no less limiting alternative (necessity test)

T e necessity test requires that no less restrictive means exist such that they would advance the legislative purpose to the same extent while limiting the constitutional right less. 44 Who should bear this burden? Several Justices of the Israeli Supreme Court have opined that the burden in this matter should lie with the party arguing that less limiting alternatives exist. 45 T us, for example, President Shamgar wrote in the case of United Mizrahi Bank :

> T e party claiming the existence of less severe alternatives beyond the margin of possibilities adopted by the legislation bears the burden of producing the evidence … [T]he State presents the path chosen by it, and of course the considerations underlying that choice. However, it does not have to, and cannot, of its own initiative, present the endless range of other possibilities that could have been pursued to achieve the same objective. T is is something that is completely unfeasible. T e party asserting the

<sup>43</sup> See Woolman and Botha, above note 14, at 44: "One obvious ground for placing the burden of justif cation on the state where it seeks to uphold a law that limits a right is that the state will of en possess unique, if not privileged, access to the information a court requires when attempting to determine whether a limitation is justif ed." See Chaskalson, Marcus, and Bishop, above note 12, at 3–7. 44 See above, at 317.

<sup>45</sup> For a discussion of the necessity, see above, at 317.

existence of another course of action, which is less grave, fairer, more reasonable, and which can justify the intervention of the court to invalidate the conditions authorizing the legislation, as these arise from section 8, bears the burden of producing the evidence, and if he does not point out the existence of such alternatives, we will be compelled to conclude that the path chosen by the legislature does not exceed the proper extent. 46

 In the context of the necessity test we should distinguish between the burden to make a claim – the burden of pleading – and the burden to produce evidence to substantiate the said claim. 47T e proposition that the party arguing that their rights were unduly limited should also identify the alternative means that may advance the legislative purpose to the same extent while restricting the constitutional right less is acceptable. Indeed, the state should not bear the burden of dealing with the "inf nite set of possibilities by which that same legislation may have been carried out." T us, the party arguing that a proper alternative exists should point to "a clear and certain alternative"; if that were not the requirement, we may be facing incomprehensible situations. However, we should not conclude that the party arguing for the existence of an alternative should also bear the evidentiary burden of producing the evidence to establish such an alternative. Rather, the burden of producing the evidence – as opposed to the burden of pleading – should be imposed on the party arguing that there is no possibility of advancing the proper purpose to the same extent with the proposed alternative, an alternative that, according to the claim, limits the constitutional right less. T is information is usually at the hands of the state; it has already been examined by the state and established the legislative provision that limited the constitutional right. T us, the state is the one that should be tasked with the burden of presenting that information to the court.

## 4. T e burden of producing the evidence and the unique nature of the judicial process in constitutional matters

T e judicial proceedings relating to a private-law dispute are characteristically dif erent from the judicial proceedings relating to a public-law

<sup>46</sup> See United Mizrahi Bank , above note 1, at para. 85. 47 For a similar distinction in a dif erent context, see F. James, "Burdens of Proof," 47 Va. L. Rev . 51, 59 ( 1961 ): "It is of en said that the party who has the burden of pleading a fact must prove it. T is is in large part true … though not infallible … T e burden of proof does not follow the burden of pleading in all cases. Many jurisdictions for example require a plaintif to plead non-payment of an obligation sued upon but not to require him to prove it." See also R. Belton, "Burdens of Pleading and Proof in Discrimination Cases: Toward a T eory of Procedural Justice," 34 Vand. L. Rev . 1205 ( 1981 ).

dispute. In a typical private-law dispute, two private parties stand before the court; both may argue that their rights have been breached by the other party. While the parties to the judicial process must act in good faith towards each other, no special duty – such as a duty of loyalty or heightened good faith – is owed by one party to the other. T e situation is dif erent in a public-law dispute. Here, on one side stands an individual claiming that his right was unduly limited by the state; while on the other side stands typically the very same state actor which applied the limitation, and which is now arguing before the court that the limitation is justif ed and therefore legally valid. T e state, unlike a private actor, has both a duty of loyalty and a heightened level of good faith towards the citizens it is meant to serve. T e individual, too, has duties to the state, including the duty to act fairly in some situations; however, the individual's duties – and their scope – are dif erent, and are of en lesser in scope than the special duties the state has towards individuals. 48 Justice Sachs of the Constitutional Court of South Africa expressed this unique position of the state as a party to constitutional litigation involving the constitutionality of the limiting statute: 49

> [T]he Constitution requires candour on the part of government. What is involved is not simply a matter of showing courtesy to the public and to the courts, desirable though that always is. It is a question of maintaining respect for the constitutional injunction that our democratic government be accountable, responsive and open. Furthermore, it is consistent with ensuring that the courts can function ef ectively, as section 165(4) of the Constitution requires … T e notion that "government knows best, end of enquiry", might have satisf ed Justice Stratford CJ in the pre-democratic era. It is no longer compatible with democratic government based on the rule of law as envisaged by our Constitution … [F]ar from the foundational values of the rule of law and of accountable government existing in discreet categories, they overlap and reinforce each other. Openness of government promotes both the rationality that the rule of law requires, and the accountability that multi-party democracy demands. In our constitutional order, the legitimacy of laws made by Parliament comes not from awe, but from openness.

T is dif erence may be manifested through the issue of the burden of production of evidence. Due to the special duty owed by the state to its citizens and the general duty of fairness (or a higher level of good faith)

<sup>48</sup> See A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006), 222. 49 Matatiele Municipality v. President of the Republic of South Africa , 2006 (5) SA 47 (CC), paras. 107, 109, 110.

owed by the state to the public, the result should be that the burden of persuasion, relating to the facts justifying a limitation on a constitutional right, be placed with the state rather than the private party to a publiclaw proceeding. Indeed, if the information relating to the existence – or non-existence – of a justif cation for the limitation is at the hands of the government, it should also be its duty to present that information to the court. T is duty can be derived, in this context, from general principles of public law. 50

T e special nature of the public-law dispute is also expressed in other parts of the proceedings, in particular those relating directly to the judge's role. T e judge's role in deciding a private-law dispute dif ers from that of deciding a public-law dispute. 51 One expression of this special role of the courts, in the context of the burden of producing evidence, can be seen in those instances where the factual framework presented to the court during the second stage of the constitutional review (the justif cation of the limitation of the right stage) is incomplete. T is situation may exist for many reasons. T us, for example, the public authority may be negligent in presenting the factual framework justifying the limitation. T e state may – in breach of its obligation – intentionally refrain from presenting the entire factual framework as it would like the court to declare the legislation unconstitutional. If the burden of producing evidence would, in these instances, lie with the party arguing that their rights were unduly limited, it is more than likely that that party would not be able to lif that burden due to f nancial or other limitations. In these cases – and in many others – the court f nds itself in a situation where a proper factual foundation to prove a limitation on a right was laid, but an insuf cient factual framework was presented to justify that limitation. In this type of situation, how should the judge rule?

T e special character of the proceedings af ects the court's behavior. In the framework of the proceedings the constitutionality of a legislative provision is determined. T is is an extremely signif cant determination. T is determination applies to parties well beyond those involved in the specif c controversy before the court. It also af ects the rule of law, as well

<sup>50</sup> See M. Taggart, "Proportionality, Deference, Wednesbury," New Zealand L. Rev . 423

<sup>( 2008 );</sup> Chaskalson, Marcus, and Bishop, above note 12, at 3–25. 51 See HCJ 6055/95 Tzemach v. Minister of Defence [1999] IsrSC 53(5) 241, 268: "I am doubtful that precedents relating to the burden of proof that originated in criminal law and private law cases should apply in the same way to public-law disputes." See also A. Chayes, "T e Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation," 89 Harv. L. Rev . 1281 (1976); O. M. Fiss, "Foreword: T e Forms of Justice," 93 Harv. L. Rev . 1 ( 1979 ).

as the notion of the validity of the administrative (or executive) action in that system. It af ects the scope of the protection of ered by the legal system to the constitutional rights. For all those reasons, it would not be proper for the court to rule on constitutionality based merely on the requirements of the burden of proof (be it either the burden of persuasion or the burden of producing evidence). As Justice Zamir of the Israeli Supreme Court has noted:

> If the petitioner was successful in raising a substantial doubt as to the validity of the state actor's considerations, or the reasonableness of the administrative decision itself, but could not produce enough evidence such that the court would be able to conclusively determine that the decision was legally valid or invalid, the court is not obligated to deny the petition merely due to lack of evidence. Instead, the court can initiate and require the state to provide answers to several additional questions, or to produce certain evidence – all as deemed necessary by the court. T is evidence may include af davits, documents, or other exhibits. T is is one of the main dif erences between a public-law dispute and a civil-law or a criminal-law dispute. T is dif erence stems, f rst and foremost, from the nature of the administrative process: Such a process deals with a decision adopted by a state actor – a public agency operating on behalf of the people and for the people; therefore, the people have a principled right to know both the facts and the reasons that led to the decision. Second, this dif erence stems from the very notion of the rule of law: In an administrative proceeding, the court should not only rule on a dispute between two parties, but also in order to protect and maintain the notion of the rule of law. According to this notion, if a substantial doubt is raised as to the legal validity of an administrative decision such a doubt must be examined in order to make sure that no legally invalid decision remains on the books. From here, we can also derive the dif erence in the attitude towards the burden of proof between administrative proceedings and civil-law or criminal-law proceedings. In an administrative proceeding, more than in a civil-law or criminal-law proceeding, the court may intervene in order to further establish the factual framework presented to it, such that it would be able to rule as to the validity of the administrative decision. For that reason, in an administrative proceeding, once a substantial doubt has been raised during the initial phase as to the validity of the decision, the subject of the burden of proof, in most cases, does not arise during the next phases of the proceedings. 52

 Accordingly, if the state is a party to the proceedings and it refrains from presenting the court with a full factual framework as to the justif cation of the limitation on a constitutional right, the court can use its own powers to

52 See Tzemach , above note 51.

demand the production of this evidence by the state. 53 T e constitutionality of the legislation should not be determined by the state's omission to produce evidence to justify it. 54 With this is mind, it is easy to understand the court's willingness to examine some of the facts on its own, including social and legislative facts, 55 as well as the court willingness to use judicial notice. 56

 What should the court do when, at the end of the proceedings, af er exhausting all the procedural options available to it in order to receive the maximum factual data, the court is still not presented with enough factual data to rule on the matter? What should the court do when all the possible factual data has been presented to it, but, af er reviewing all the facts, the factual scales are balanced? In both of those types of cases, due to the central role of the limited human right, the court's decision should be against the party claiming a justif cation for the limitation of the human right. 57 When a justif cation is not fully established, the limitation on the right is not constitutional.

 Justice Zamir of the Israeli Supreme Court has noted that, whenever the factual framework presented to the court is "so feeble that the court cannot establish any concrete f ndings on it as required to rule on the issue of the validity of the administrative action," 58 then, in those cases, the issue of the burden of proof should be inf uenced by the special nature of the administrative proceeding:

- 53 See Khosa v. Minister of Social Development , 2004 6 SA 505 (CC), para. 18: "Even in those cases where the view is taken that there is nothing to be said in support of challenged legislation, a court, in order to exercise the due care required of it when dealing with such matters, may well require the assistance of counsel. In this case it should have been apparent to the respondents that the declaration of invalidity of the impugned legislation could have signif cant budgetary and administrative implications for the state. If the necessary evidence is not placed before the courts dealing with such matters their ability to perform their constitutional mandate will be hampered and the constitutional scheme itself put at risk. It is government's duty to ensure that the relevant evidence is placed
- before the court." (Mokgoro, J.). 54 See Woolman and Botha, above note 14, at 44: "[T]he Constitutional Court has, on a number of occasions, stated that the failure by the government to of er any support for
- a limitation does not relieve a court of the duty to inquire into its justif ability". 55 See Hogg, above note 14, at 806; K. C. Davis, "Facts in Lawmaking," 80 Colum. L. Rev . 931 (1980); A. Woolhandler, "Rethinking the Judicial Reception of Legislative Facts," 41
- Vand. L. Rev . 111 ( 1988 ). 56 Regarding the doctrine of judicial notice, see S. L. Phipson, Phipson on evidence , 15th edn. ( 2000 ), 33. Regarding judicial knowledge in the process of the constitutional review of the law, see Hogg, above note 14, at 808. 57 See Moise v. Greater Germiston Transitional Local Council , 2001 (4) SA 491. 58 See Tzemach , above note 51, at 268.
- 
- 

T e issue of the burden of proof may be inf uenced by considerations of the rule of law, by the presumption of constitutionality, by the social importance of the limited right and the scope and the size of the limitation at issue, by the ef ciency of the administration and by other publicinterest considerations. 59

 It seems that, if at the end of the day the court is not convinced that there exists a justif cation for the limitation of the right, then the court should hold that the limitation could not satisfy the requirement posed by the proportionality tests; therefore, the limitation is unconstitutional. Neither the presumption of constitutionality nor the presumption of legality applies at this stage of the review. T e administration's ef ciency, as well as other public interest considerations cannot produce, in and of themselves, a valid justif cation for a limitation on a constitutionally protected right, or even impose the burden of showing such a justif cation on the party arguing that their right was unduly limited. However, such considerations may af ect the remedies for such a limitation; those remedies are outside the scope of this book.

# Proportionality's importance

17

### **A. Proportionality and its critique**

 Since the end of the Second World War, proportionality has been widely received. It is now a part of many a legal system. 1 It is a manifestation of the migration, or transplantation, of laws. T is trend has also continued into the beginning of the twenty-f rst century. Indeed, we now live in the age of proportionality. As balancing is found at proportionality's foundation we can also say that we live in the age of balancing. 2 However, proportionality is of en highly criticized. In particular, the criticism is aimed at the component of proportionality stricto sensu . T e latter is based on balancing between conf icting principles. T is balancing is contested. Although in our private lives we are constantly balancing between conf icting principles, there are many critics of this balance when it is conducted by the courts and aimed at the review of the law's constitutionality. T is part of the book will examine the various arguments in favor of proportionality and against it, while reviewing some of its possible alternatives. 3 At the examination's foundation are proportionality stricto sensu and the balancing at its core. T e arguments presented here, therefore, apply equally to constitutional and interpretive balancing. 4 I am not of the opinion that proportionality is the only necessary condition, or even a conditio sine qua non , to the existence of a constitutional review. I am not of the opinion that the only rational way to reach a judicial decision is through proportionality. Further, I do not believe that, if we forego the notion of proportionality, the result would be that all constitutional rights would be absolute. Instead, my approach is based on the argument that,

of all the options available to ensure human rights in a pluralistic, democratic society, proportionality is the best available option. T e approach herein to proportionality, in other words, is a proportional approach.

### **B. Te emphasis on the need forrational justifcation**

 Proportionality – and the act of balancing at its foundation – emphasizes the need to rationally justify a limitation of a constitutionally protected right. 5 It also requires a constant examination of this justif cation's existence. It establishes, in ef ect – to use Mureinik's term – a "culture of justif cations." 6 Democracy is based on human rights. Any limitation on human rights requires a legal justif cation. 7 As Justice Ackerman of the Constitutional Court of South Africa has well observed:

> In reaction to our past, the concept and values of the constitutional state, of the "regstaat", and the constitutional right to equality before the law are deeply foundational to the creation of the "new order" referred to in the preamble. T e detailed enumeration and description in [the general limitation provision] of the criteria which must be met before the legislature can limit a right entrenched in [the Bill of Rights] emphasize the importance, in our new constitutional state, of reason and justif cation

when rights are sought to be curtailed. We have moved from a past characterized by much which was arbitrary and unequal in the operation of the law to a present and a future in a constitutional state where state [or private] action must be such that it is capable of being analyzed and justif ed rationally. 8

 Indeed, the theory behind proportionality is not intended to merely categorize a case into a group which solves the problem. Rather, proportionality is aimed at a constant review of the existence of a rational justif cation for the limitation imposed on the right, while taking into consideration each case's circumstances.

T is justif cation is not merely a matter for the courts to ref ect upon. Each of the three branches of government must consider this justif cation as well. 9 Accordingly, before a law limiting a constitutional right is enacted, the members of the legislative body must be persuaded that the limitation is justif ed. T e same is true for the executive and judicial branch's decisions. Proportionality establishes a uniform analytical framework for any state action that may af ect constitutional rights. Even if there is no judicial review or if this review is limited in nature, there is still a need for a rational justif cation of a limitation of a constitutional right. 10 Proportionality ensures constitutional uniformity in the search for a justif cation for the limitation placed on a constitutional right. However, proportionality fully acknowledges the dif erent scope of discretion provided to each of the three governmental branches. 11 Moreover, the scope of the said governmental discretion varies from one branch to another and may also change in accordance to the proportionality component at issue. T us, for example, the widest discretion regarding the purpose component is given to the legislative branch. 12 On the other hand, the widest discretion regarding the balance between the marginal social importance in fulf lling the purpose and the marginal social importance of preventing harm to the constitutional right in relation to proportionality stricto sensu , given to the judicial branch. 13

 Proportionality is a framework based on a structured method of thought. It determines the information which should be considered which includes the proper purpose of the limiting law, its rational connection to the means used by the law, the law's necessity, and the marginal social importance of the purpose of the limiting law as compared

to the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the right. Proportionality is based on the reasons underlying each constitutional right, as well as the justif cations for their limitation. T ese reasons and those justif cations in and of themselves, however, are extrinsic to the concept of proportionality. Proportionality is unable to resolve those issues. Indeed, the answers to those questions may be found elsewhere in the laws of each legal system. T e governmental branch conducting the balance in each particular case – be it the legislative, executive, or judicial branch – may learn about those issues from sources extrinsic to the concept of proportionality itself.

 Due to its limited scope and structured nature, proportionality should not be identif ed with any "right-wing" or "lef -wing" social theories. 14 Proportionality should not be seen as being in favor of, or against, any liberal or communitarian doctrines. 15 Rather, proportionality is a "tool." It is a legal construction. It is a legal methodology. 16 Proportionality's focus on the issue of the rational justif cation of the limitation of the right serves the notion of a constitutional democracy well.

### **C. Te need forstructured discretion**

### 1. T e importance of structured discretion

 Proportionality is based on the notion of structured discretion. 17 A person applying proportionality must think in stages. 18 First, they must distinguish between questions relating to the right's scope and those relating

<sup>14</sup> See J. M. Shaman, "Constitutional Interpretation: Illusion and Reality," 41 Wayne L. Rev .

<sup>135, 154 ( 1995 ). 15</sup> See S. Shif rin, "Liberalism, Radicalism, and Legal Scholarship," 30 UCLA L. Rev . 1103 ( 1982 ); compare with Kumm, above note 5. See also R. F. Nagel, "Liberals and Balancing," 63 U. Colo. L. Rev . 319 ( 1992 ). See below, at 467. 16 See above, at 394.

Weinrib, "T e Postwar Paradigm and American Exceptionalism," in S. Choudhry (ed.), T e Migration of Constitutional Ideas (Cambridge University Press, 2006), 84, 96; P. Craig, Administrative Law , 6th edn. (London: Sweet & Maxwell, 2008 ), 637; Kavanagh,

above note 7, at 255. 18 See M. Fordham, "Common Law Proportionality," 7 Judicial Review 110, 112 ( 2002 ).

to the justif cation of limits on its realization and its protection. 19 Next, during the stage of justif cation of the limitation of the right and its protection, they should distinguish between the threshold question regarding a proper purpose 20 and questions relating to the means selected to advance that purpose, 21 as well as the relation between the fulf llment of the purpose and the harm caused to the constitutional right. 22 In other words, once the threshold requirement of proper purpose has been satisf ed, the focus shif s to the three sub-questions relating both to the rational connection of the means selected by the legislator to advance its proper purpose, the necessity of the law, and the balance struck between the advancement of this purpose and the harm caused to the right in question. T e f rst two questions – the "suitability" of the means and their necessity – are related to the relation between the proper purpose and the means chosen to advance it. T e third question – that of proportionality stricto sensu – is related to the balance between advancing the purpose and limiting the constitutional right. T e balance is performed according to the basic balancing rule 23 and the specif c balancing rule. 24 On the basis of those components, the justif cation of limiting a constitutional right should be analyzed.

T e structured nature of the discretion involved in proportionality has many advantages. 25 For one, it allows the person conducting proportionality analyses to think analytically, not to skip over things which should be considered, and to consider them in their time and place. 26 Proportionality also encourages the use of comparative-law analysis, since it can easily demonstrate whether a proper basis for comparison exists. 27 While these advantages apply to any exercise of proportionality's structured discretion by the three branches of government, they particularly apply in the

context of exercising legislative discretion. Indeed, the structured nature of proportionality's discretion is predominantly designed to assist members of the legislative body to "think constitutionally," as required by the constitutional nature of legislative action. T us, while considering legislation intended to limit a human right, the legislators must examine whether such legislation satisf es the requirements posed by the limitation clause. T e same is true for an executive action that may limit a constitutional right. Finally, the structured nature of the discretion may assist the judges in "thinking constitutionally," as required by the constitutional nature of the judicial task in a constitutional democracy. While in most instances the structured nature of the discretion is mentioned in the context of judicial activity, it is important to note that proportionality in general, as well as the structured nature of its discretion in particular, is available to anyone required to act proportionally. T is is f rst and foremost the legislator. Beside the legislator stands the judge, who is assisted by discretion's structured nature while dealing with human rights in general, and while determining the proportionality of their limitation in particular.

### 2. Transparency

T e structured nature of the discretion exercised by proportionality provides additional advantages. One of those is transparency. 28 A person reviewing a decision obtained based on structured discretion – be it a legislative decision to legislate, or a judicial decision as to the constitutionality of legislation – can both recognize and follow the stages and the reasons leading to the decision. T e decision is no longer a "closed book." Rather, everything is out in the open – on the face of the decision. Accordingly, it should be fairly easy to identify the legislator's considerations; it would be possible to know why a law has been enacted and why specif c legislative measures were adopted. It becomes possible to examine the reasons behind the legislation, as well as the factual framework underlying it. T e

Rev . 1, 20 ( 1997 ); M. Sachs, GG Verfassungsrecht II Grundrechte (Berlin: Springer, 2003 ), 71; V. C. Jackson, "Being Proportional about Proportionality," 21 Const. Comment . 803, 830 ( 2004 ); F. M. Cof n, "Judicial Balancing: T e Protean Scales of Justice," 63 N. Y. U. L. Rev . 16 ( 1988 ); T. Poole, "Tilting at Windmills?: Truth and Illusion in the Political Constitution," 70 Mod. L. Rev . 250, 268 ( 2007 ); for a critique of this approach, see V. C. Jackson, "Ambivalent Resistance and Comparative Constitutionalism: Opening Up the Conversation on 'Proportionality', Rights and Federalism," 1 U. Pa. J. Const. L . 583, 621 ( 1999 ).

same is true for the judicial branch. T e process of judicial decisionmaking becomes open to the reader. T e reasons at the decision's foundation are provided, as well as their relative weight. T us, those decisions are better explained and understood. Moreover, it becomes much easier to properly criticize those decisions. It can be expected. 29 As Sadurski has observed:

> A judge engaged in the act of weighing and balancing of competing constitutional goods discloses the elements of his reasoning to the public. It is, to use an admittedly imperfect analogy, as if a cook in an elegant restaurant f rst revealed to the customers all the ingredients and then showed the guests, step by step, all the stages of the preparation of the dish before it lands on their tables. 30

T is transparency may point out both dif culties faced by the judge in obtaining the result at issue; it also demonstrates the thought-process behind the decision, eliminating any notion of a "mechanical" approach in reaching it. All these enhance the public's trust in the courts as well as in democracy itself.

T e said transparency is important in a democratic system. It allows for the understanding of the decision's foundation. Understanding yields appreciation, even when the result is disputed. Transparency is the basis for educated public discourse, as well as for a constitutional dialogue between the legislative and judicial branches. 31 It allows for informed criticism of the decision. It prevents conf icts of interest and the consideration of irrelevant or unethical issues – if the decisionmaker is exposed to them. It leads to faith in the decisionmakers' integrity. Of course, transparency cannot guarantee that these results can be achieved in all cases; it is always possible to hide one's ulterior motives so that even transparency cannot expose them. However, transparency is a major contribution to the notion of fairness and integrity in the decisionmaking process. T at contribution, in and of itself, is of major value.

## 3. Appropriate considerations in proper context

 Another advantage of ered by the structured nature of proportionality's discretion is that appropriate considerations are taken into account in

<sup>29</sup> London Regional Transport and another v. T e Mayor of London and another [2001]

EWCA Civ. 1491, §§ 57–58. 30 W. Sadurski, "'Reasonableness' and Value Pluralism in Law and Politics," in G. Bongiovanni, G. Sartor, and C. Valentini (eds.), Reasonableness and Law (Dordrecht: Springer, 2009), 129, 139. 31 See below, at 465.

their proper context. Even without discretion's structured nature it can be guaranteed that only the relevant considerations be taken into account. T e structured element ensures that those pertinent considerations are weighed in their proper context. 32 T ey guarantee, therefore, that considerations relating to the public interest or to the rights of others are considered only during the second stage of the analysis – regarding the justif cation of the limitation on the constitutional right – and not during the f rst stage – when determining the scope of the right. 33 T ey ensure that considerations of proper purpose are taken into account only as an independent, threshold requirement rather than during the examination of the means required to fulf ll as well as to harm the constitutional right. 34 T ey ensure that the balancing between the conf icting principles will occur only during the last stage of proportionality, during the examination of proportionality stricto sensu . 35

T e importance of allowing for the appropriate considerations in the proper context is signif cant. Take, for example, the right to family life vis-à-vis the interest of national security. 36 If the two collide "too early," it is quite certain that the national security interest would prevail, since in general the notion of life is superior to the notion of family life. But, if we properly distinguish between the interpretive matter of whether the right to family life constitutes a part of the right to human dignity (the issue of the right's scope) and the matter of justif cation whether the balance between fulf lling security and preserving family life (the issue of proportionality stricto sensu ), then a proper framework is established to examine the balance between them. Such a framework does not provide a general and permanent answer to the issue of the balance between national security and the right to family life. But such a framework would be able to resolve the issue at hand, which is the appropriate balance between the marginal social importance of the security measure of imposing a blanket restriction on family unif cation (compared with a proportional alternative) and the marginal social importance of preventing the separation between spouses of the same family, or between those spouses and their children. Instead of a general discussion examining which is constitutionally superior – life or family life – we are provided with a much more specif c discussion, examining the proportionality of the marginal social importance gained by the interest of national security following

the imposition of the blanket restriction as compared with the marginal social importance of preventing harm caused to those family members who are the subject of such blanket restriction.

### 4. A dialogue between the legislature and the judiciary

 A structured and transparent discretion fosters open dialogue between the legislative and judicial branches. 37 Prior to the adoption of a bill, the legislator must ensure that there is a justif cation for limiting a constitutional right. It must be satisf ed that its purposes are proper, that the means selected to advance those purposes are proper, and that the limitation of the constitutional right is proportional. In that context, the legislator must examine the factual framework that serves as the basis of its assertion 38 that the means selected are rational 39 and that they are necessary to advance the proper purpose. 40 T e legislative branch is aware of the need

to balance between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by the legislation and the marginal social importance of preventing harm to the constitutional right. T e basic balancing rule 41 directs the legislative discretion.

T ese data are presented to the judiciary when it convenes to consider the constitutionality of that same legislation. T e opinion produced by the court expresses the judge's thought process. It highlights the data which lead it to the decision that the law's purpose is proper or not. It explains how conclusions were reached regarding the other component of proportionality. When the conclusion is that the legislation is unconstitutional, the reasons behind that conclusion are clear.

T e court's ruling that the legislation is unconstitutional is not the end of the road. T e dialogue between the two branches – which began with the legislation and continued with the determination that the legislation is unconstitutional – persists. T e matter is then returned to the legislator. T e transparency of the judicial decision allows the legislator to understand what should be done to continue fulf lling that law's purposes. T e legislator has several options. First, assuming the court declared the purpose to be improper, it can modify the legislative purpose accordingly. T at, in turn, would require the selection of new means to advance that purpose. Second, should the court approve of the purpose but declare the means disproportional, the legislator may select other, more proportional measures to advance it. T e legislator may choose other ways. In any event, all these options are open to the legislator because now, af er the judicial opinion has been produced, it is fully aware of what is constitutionally valid and what is not.

 If the legislator continues to insist on its original opinion, and sees no room to change it, the dialogue does not come to a close. T e option available for the legislator is to take steps to amend the constitution. 42 Most constitutional rights are not "eternal." T ey can be amended. T e dialogue between the legislator and the judge now moves on to a higher constitutional level, regarding constitutional amendment. At times, the constitution amendment is politically complex, and at other times it is easily obtained. T is dif culty or ease cannot harm the basic idea at the dialogue's foundation. When a constitutional amendment is not possible

(legally or politically), the option of a new constitution becomes relevant. An interesting question is whether in such a case the dialogue comes to an end.

T us, proportionality encourages an open dialogue between the different branches of government. 43 We are no longer dealing with two separate monologues or with a dialogue between deaf participants. Rather, we come across an interaction between the dif erent branches of government, such that each branch is fully aware of, and fully comprehends, the actions taken by the other. In that way, each branch is encouraged to be more considerate of the other. All this is due to the fact that all three branches operate according to the framework of a uniform normative method, well recognized by each branch and common to all.

### **D. Proportionality and human rightstheories**

### 1. Proportionality as a vessel for human rights theories

T ere are many theories regarding human rights and their limitations. 44 Most of those theories can be found within proportionality. T e concept of proportionality is not based upon – or committed to – any particular human rights theory. Rather, it may serve as a vessel for many – even opposing – theories about human rights. T e reason for that relates to the very nature of the concept. Proportionality is an analytical and legal tool. It is fed by extrinsic data. T rough dif erent degrees of intensity relating to the requirements of proper purpose, rational connection, necessity, or proportionality stricto sensu , one is able to incorporate most current human rights theories into the concept of proportionality. However,

proportionality is not "neutral." It is meant to protect both the human rights and the public interest at the same time. It allows the imposition of certain restrictions on constitutional rights, but ensures that those limitations are properly justif ed. 45 Accordingly, proportionality is not equally suitable to all theories of human rights. T ere are some theories that are more compatible with proportionality than others. T us, for example, proportionality is well suited to Alexy's theory of principle-shaped rights. As we have seen, 46 according to Alexy, a principle always strives for optimal realization, in accordance with the available factual and legal possibilities – that is, in accordance with the rules of proportionality. T e relationship between Alexy's theory of constitutional rights (shaped as principles) and proportionality is therefore both direct and necessary. 47 Proportionality is also compatible with communitarian approaches to human rights. T ese theories are based on the recognition of a proper balance between individual rights and the public interest. 48 But is proportionality compatible with liberal approaches? I turn now to examine this question.

### 2. Proportionality and liberalism

### i. T e general argument

 In an important article, Kumm examines the extent to which proportionality provides a proper response to the issue of the right's structure in accordance with liberal theories. 49 In general, liberal theories in the present context represent the notion that individual rights are principally superior to the public interest; accordingly, a special justif cation is required to limit those rights to support that interest. In that respect, Kumm examined one of proportionality's common criticisms, according to which it does not adequately accommodate this liberal theory. As Kumm writes:

<sup>45</sup> See above, at 166. 46 See above, at 38. 47 See above, at 39. 48 See M. J. Sandel (ed.), Liberalism and its Critics ( 1984 ); M. J. Sandel, Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1996 ); S. Mulhall and A. Swif , Liberals and Communitarians

<sup>(</sup>Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell, 1996 ). 49 M. Kumm, "Political Liberalism and the Structures of Rights: On the Place and Limits of the Proportionality Requirement," in G. Pavlakos (ed.), Law, Rights, and Discourse: T e Legal Philosophy of Robert Alexy (Portland, OR: Hart Publishing, 2007), 131, 141. Compare with R. Mullender, "T eorizing the T ird Way: Qualif ed Consequentialism, the Proportionality Principle, and the New Social Democracy," 27(4) J. L. & Soc'y 493 ( 2000 ).

 Liberal political rights are widely perceived as having special weight when competing with policy goals. T e idea is expressed, for example, by Ronald Dworkin's conception of rights as trumps and the corollary distinction between principles and policies, or by what Rawls calls the "priority of the right over the good", or by Habermas' description of rights as f rewalls. Ultimately these ideas can be traced back to a theory, perhaps most fully developed by Immanuel Kant, grounded in the twin ideals of human dignity and autonomy viewed as side-constraints on the pursuit of the collective good. Yet nothing in the account of rights as principles prioritises rights. Rights and policies compete on the same plane within the context of proportionality analysis. 50

 Kumm then analyzes this liberal criticism, while distinguishing between three approaches of prioritizing rights over the public interest. He examines each of these and its relation to proportionality. We will follow in Kumm's footsteps.

### ii. T e prioritization of rights and the approach of liberal antiperfectionism

 Liberal approaches to human rights are based on the notion that no individual should be forced to adopt a certain way, directed by the government, to pursue his or her own happiness (the "good life"). T e determination as to those issues should be lef in the hands of the individual. T at is the basis of the notion that the state cannot enforce a certain type of the "good life" on its citizens; in fact, the state's views in this context should be irrelevant. In any event, such views by the state should never be used in order to justify a limitation placed on individual rights. Due to its "negative" character, this notion is also known as the concept of "excluded reasons."

 Kumm indicates 51 that this perception of liberalism is not in conf ict with the concept of proportionality. In fact, proportionality endorses such a perception in presenting the requirement for a proper purpose. 52 Simply put, excluded reasons may not be used to form a proper purpose. While the protection of the rights of others is always a proper purpose, the mere protection of the public interest does not satisfy, in and of itself, the threshold requirement of a proper purpose. 53 T us, exceptional reasons are required to justify a limitation on human rights for reasons relating to

<sup>50</sup> Kumm, above note 49, at 141–142.

<sup>51</sup> Ibid ., at 143. 52 See R. Alexy, "T irteen Replies," in G. Pavlakos (ed.), Law, Rights, and Discourse: T e Legal Philosophy of Robert Alexy (Portland, OR: Hart Publishing, 2007 ), 333, 341. 53 See above, at 256.

the public interest, and the nature of those exceptional reasons is determined by the rules of proportionality. T e reasons themselves are derived from considerations extrinsic to proportionality itself. 54 To the extent that a constitutional democracy would like to adopt this liberal antiperfectionist approach, it may well do so through the concept of proportionality. Accordingly, the tests of proportionality would only be applied in their proper context; therefore, the notion of "excluded reasons" not only does not contradict proportionality, it actually complements it.

- iii. T e prioritization of rights and liberal anticollectivism
 According to this aspect of the liberal approach, the individual right should be prioritized over the collective good. Such prioritization does not necessarily translate into turning the public interest into an excluded reason. Rather, the public interest is a relevant consideration, but the right should also be given a proper weight, ref ecting the centrality of the notions of both human dignity and autonomy in the system.

 According to Kumm, 55 this liberal concept is also entirely compatible with proportionality. 56 T e public interest – the "common good" – is also a legitimate consideration within proportionality; however, that consideration alone cannot suf ce to provide a justif cation for a limitation of a constitutional right. T at is for two reasons. First, proportionality requires special circumstances in order to consider the public interest as the justif cation for the limitation. Second, the public interest is never considered on its own, as proportionality also requires that the means selected to advance that interest comply with the other components of proportionality. Both of these requirements af ect the weight accorded to considerations of the public interest whenever it conf icts with a constitutional right. Again, the actual content of these requirements is determined by considerations extrinsic to proportionality itself; yet proportionality ultimately ref ects what a democratic society would deem as fair and appropriate considerations.

## iv. T e prioritization of rights and liberal anticonsequentialism

 In contrast with the previous two liberal concepts, Kumm admits that proportionality is incompatible with the concept of anticonsequentialist

- 54 See Shif rin, above note 15, at 1211. 55 Kumm, above note 49, at 148.
- 
- 56 See Alexy, above note 52, at 341.

liberalism. 57 T is is because proportionality, ultimately, is built upon a consequentialist method of thinking. It does not support a mere deontological view of rights. T us, proportionality places certain boundaries on the limitation of rights even in those cases where such limitations are meant to achieve desired consequences. According to the Kantian notion of deontological rights, the saving of three lives cannot be justif ed by sacrif cing the life of a fourth; such a conclusion may not always be achieved when using proportionality analysis.

### v. Deontological concepts and proportionality

 Kumm is correct in noting that proportionality is not a solution for a liberal deontological approach. Proportionality is based on a balance which compares the relative values of principles while considering the consequences of either advancing or limiting them. A deontological approach, in contrast, does not take consequences into account. 58 It is theoretically possible to argue – as Alexy has done 59 – that deontological approaches also conduct a balance, but that the right's end of the scales would always be granted inf nite weight such that it would always prevail over the end of the scales consisting of achieving the legislative purpose. T is is an admission that proportionality cannot really operate in a deontological environment. Indeed, proportionality may only be operable when the right in question is relative, that is, when it is not protected to the fullest extent of its scope. 60 Whenever a right is absolute – which is the essence of the anticonsequentialist concept – there is no room for proportionality. Similarly, there is no place for proportionality whenever the public interest is perceived as absolute. Indeed, proportionality can only operate when the weights of the conf icting principles at issue are larger than zero and smaller than inf nity. It is only between those two extremes that proportionality can properly conduct a meaningful balance. But, in the extreme cases, beyond that range, proportionality cannot be utilized; the only solution to these cases may be found outside the concept of proportionality. A separate question is whether a liberal deontological concept can apply such that it would not be indif erent to the consequences in any given case. 61 T us, for example, would a deontological approach not

- 58 Ibid ., at 153. 59 See Alexy, above note 52, at 344.
- 60 See above, at 32.
- 61 See Kumm, above note 49, at 154.

take consequences into account even in a case of a fatal catastrophe? If the answer to this question is that it would, then proportionality – and the act of balancing on which it is based – may be said to be compatible with deontological approaches as well. T is would not be the case if deontological approaches would refuse, under all circumstances, to take consequences into account. If that is the case, then there is no alternative but to admit that proportionality is incompatible with this particular liberal concept.

### **E. Proportionality, democracy, and judicialreview**

### 1. Proportionality and democracy

T e legal source of proportionality is found (directly or indirectly) in the constitution. 62 By basing itself on this notion, proportionality gains not only a legal source for its constitutional status but also a substantive justif cation for its operation. If proportionality is derived from democracy and the rule of law (including the formal and substantive meanings of the terms), then democracy and the rule of law are also the justif cations for the concept of proportionality. 63 Indeed, democracy, the rule of law, and human rights are inseparable. Without democracy and the rule of law there are no human rights, and without human rights there is no democracy and rule of law. 64 T is relationship between democracy, the rule of law, and human rights is based on the understanding that when a number of legal conditions are met, the limitation of human rights is not undemocratic. Hence, here one may also derive the notion that human rights are not absolute. 65 T e limitation of human rights is compatible with democracy and the rule of law if there is a proper justif cation for limiting a constitutional right, namely, a proper balance is struck between the rights on the one end and the reasons for their limitation on the other. Note that it is not claimed herein that proportionality is the only way to determine the proper balance between the public interest and constitutional rights. Nor is it claimed, at this stage, 66 that proportionality is the best way in a democracy to determine the proper balance between individual rights and the public interest. All that is argued at this stage is that there is a meaningful,

inherent connection between proportionality and democracy and the rule of law, and that this is enough to establish proportionality's key role in a constitutional democracy.

### 2. Proportionality and judicial review

 Most democracies recognize judicial review of the constitutionality of a law limiting a constitutional right. 67 In most cases, such recognition is the result of an explicit constitutional provision. 68 In rare cases – such as in the United States 69 and Israel 70 – the recognition is the result of the judicial interpretation of implicit constitutional provisions. T e justif cation for judicial review on the constitutionality of legislation – much like the justif cation for proportionality itself 71 – can be traced back to the notion of democracy itself. According to that approach, if the constitution is democratic, then the judicial review found (explicitly or implicitly) in the constitution is also democratic. 72T at same view also holds that democracy does not manifest itself solely through majority rule. Democracy, rather, also consists of the recognition of human rights. T us, when the court holds that a legislative provision is unconstitutional due to its undue limitation of a human right, it actually fulf lls the constitution and democracy. 73

book. I will examine two responses to those claims, one by Kumm 76 and the other by Beatty. 77

### 3. Kumm's approach

 Kumm emphasizes proportionality's uniqueness. He does not concern himself with the interpretation of the constitutional right. His theory does not examine – as the accepted approach in the United States does – the specif c case's belonging to a predetermined category. Proportionality is unique in that it examines the justif cation of the limitation of a constitutional right in a given case:

> Courts engage public reason, reasons that can serve to justify acts of public authorities that place burdens on people without their explicit consent. 78

T is way of thinking is dubbed by Kumm as the Rational Human Right Paradigm (RHRP). 79 According to Kumm's approach: 80

> Both judicial review of legislation and electoral accountability of the legislator give institutional expression to co-original and equally basic commitments of liberal-democratic constitutionalism. An equal right to vote gives expression to a commitment of political equality. A right to contest decisions by public authorities before gives expression to a commitment of liberty as non-domination not to be subject to laws that you might not reasonably have consented to. Both are central pillars of constitutional legitimacy.

### According to his approach:

 Judicial review is not just a legitimate option. Liberal democracy without judicial review would be incomplete and def cient. 81

### Kumm f nds an interesting relationship between Socratic contestation and thinking according to proportionality. According to his approach:

T e point of judicial review … is to legally institutionalize a practice of Socratic contestation. Socratic contestation refers to the practice of

<sup>76</sup> See M. Kumm, "Democracy Is Not Enough: Rights, Proportionality and the Point of Judicial Review" (New York University Public Law and Legal T eory, Working Papers. Paper 118, 2009 ); A. Harel and T. Kahana, "T e Easy Core Case for Judicial Review" 2 J. Legal Analysis 227 ( 2010 ). 77 M. Beatty, T e Ultimate Rule of Law (Oxford University Press, 2004 ). 78 Kumm, above note 76, at 3.

<sup>79</sup> Ibid ., at 6. 80 Ibid ., at 4. 81 Ibid ., at 6.

critically engaging authorities, in order to assess whether the claims they make are based on good reasons. 82

 According to my approach, there is a deep relationship between democracy and human rights and the judicial review of a law's constitutionality. T rough judicial review the individual's right is protected vis-à-vis the majority's power. As such, judicial review fulf lls the constitution. Just as the constitution is based on the limitation of the majority's power, so is judicial review. Just as the constitution is countermajoritarian so is judicial review. Kumm's approach that at the constitution's foundation are the majority and the individual's powers is accepted herein. One of these is expressed in elections. T e other is expressed by the courts. 83 Kumm writes: 84

> T e question is not what justif es the "Countermajoritarian" imposition of outcomes by non-elected judges. T e question is what justif es the authority of a legislative decision, when it can be established with suf cient certainty that it imposes burdens on individuals for which there is no plausible justif cation. T e judicial practice of Socratic contestation, structured conceptually by the RHRP and the proportionality test, and institutionally protected by rules relating to independence, impartiality and reason-giving, is uniquely suitable to give expression to and enforce this aspect of constitutional legitimacy. Constitutional legitimacy does not stand only on one leg.

### 4. Beatty's approach

### i. T e approach presented

 In his book, T e Ultimate Rule of Law , 85 Beatty argues that proportionality guarantees judicial objectivity and provides the main justif cation for the exercise of judicial review. Judicial objectivity is ensured by proportionality by turning legal questions – which have a wide judicial discretion – into factual questions. As Beatty puts it:

<sup>82</sup> Ibid ., at 4. 83 See S. Freeman, "Constitutional Democracy and the Legitimacy of Judicial Review," 9 Law and Philosophy 327 ( 1990 ); J. Raz, "Rights and Politics," 71 Ind. L. J . 27 ( 1995 ); Harel, "Rights-Based Judicial Review," above note 75; Eylon and Harel, above note 75; Harel and Kahana, above note 76; see also Kavanagh, above note 7, at 338. 84 Kumm, above note 76.

<sup>85</sup> D. M. Beatty, T e Ultimate Rule of Law (Oxford University Press, 2004 ).

 [P]roportionality of ers judges a clear and objective test to distinguish coercive action by the state that is legitimate from that which is not. When they stick to the facts, the personal sympathies of the judges towards the parties in the case never come into play. 86

### Beatty elaborates:

 With its focus on the particulars of each act of government, proportionality transforms questions that in moral philosophy are questions of value into questions of fact. It stimulates a distinctive kind of discourse that operates, in Habermas's terms, in an intermediate zone between facts and norms. In deciding whether a law on abortion, or sex discrimination, or housing, or health care, is constitutional or not, everything turns on the facts. Whether a state can legitimately punish women who abort their fetuses, or treat people dif erently on the basis of their religion or sex, or withhold resources they need to survive, depends entirely on the factual details of each case. Strict abortion laws can be justif ed in societies such as Ireland whose religious traditions equate pre- and post-natal life. Some forms of discrimination may be tolerated in the home that could not be practiced on the street. T e resources each person can legitimately claim from the state vary directly with the af uence of their communities and the number of people who are in need. 87

### ii. A critique of Beatty's approach

 Beatty's book made an important contribution to the understanding of human rights as well as of judicial review on legislation limiting those rights. 88 It clarif es the important role played by proportionality in protecting human rights. It emphasizes the centrality of proportionality in the f eld of human rights protection, and supports the recognition of judicial review on the constitutionality of limiting legislation.

sensu . It is not factual in any way. True, this test is also based on a factual framework; but its main f ndings are legal. It is based on balancing. Indeed, the determination of whether the advancement of the social purpose may be properly balanced against the harm to the human right ref ects a value-based determination as to the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by fulf lling that social purpose as well as the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right. T ese determinations are not factual. T ese are legal determinations. 90 Value-based judgments do not provide the judge with full, unbounded discretion; in fact, judicial discretion is well bounded, and in some cases extremely so. However, I cannot accept the argument that the judge has no element of discretion in making a determination on those issues. 91 Proportionality cannot guarantee complete objectivity. In fact, each of proportionality's components entails an element of judicial discretion which must be exercised with an element of judicial subjectivity. But proportionality limits judicial discretion. It emphasizes the justif cation requirement, the structured nature of judicial discretion, its transparency, the need to realize the basic balancing rule and the concrete balancing. All those signif cantly limit the scope of the judicial discretion and its subjective aspects. As Justice Breyer wrote in Heller in reference to proportionality:

> [A]pplication of such an approach, of course, requires judgment, but the very nature of the approach – requiring careful identif cation of the relevant interests and evaluating the law's ef ect upon them – limits the judge's choices. 92

T e judge is no longer required to determine which interest is more important – human dignity or national security. 93 Proportionality clarif es and redef nes the legal issues requiring judicial determination. T at legal issue is the balance between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by the public interest and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the right due to the said limitation in solving the fact that the judges cannot exercise complete discretion;

nor can they consider any consideration they see f t. T e judges cannot impose their own values upon the society in which they operate. T ey should balance between the dif erent interests in accordance with what they view as the best interests of the society of which they are a member.

 Even when discretion is used, in exceptional cases, subjectively, 94 this subjectivity is meant to achieve the proper balance and not to advance one's personal worldview. Although this judicial subjectivity 95 is recognized, it

However, it is essential to remember that the subjective considerations part is very small. Most of the judge's work is dictated by a complex framework of objective considerations. T ese originate in the founding documents and have been determined in case law as well as being shared by all judges. T e decision is always value-laden. T at does not mean that said judgment is subjective. Most value-laden judgments are objective, and pre-determined by the legal system's most fundamental values. A professional judge may well arrive at those value judgments while properly dif erentiating between the objective considerations and his own subjective approaches. T is is the way judicial decisions have been made throughout history. T e dif culties involved in producing a judicial decision, the 'opinionated' nature, in some cases, of the decision, or the need for a subjective determination in some cases – do not deny the special status gained by values and principles in the system, as well as the need to balance between them at the point of conf ict. We no longer wish to return to the period of the jurisprudence of pure notions ( Begrif sjurisprudenz ) in which the conclusion appeared, seemingly independently, from objective considerations. We prefer a jurisprudence of principles ( Interessenjurisprudenz ) and jurisprudence of values ( Wertungsjurisprudenz ), where an 'opinionated' decision is required … We prefer substance over form.

# T e criticism on proportionality and a retort

# **A. Te scope of the criticism on proportionality**

 Proportionality is under constant attack. 1 T e criticism against proportionality is primarily aimed at its balancing component, proportionality stricto sensu . T is balancing has been referred to as "the enfant terrible of modern judging." 2 T e criticism on judicial balancing does indeed abound. 3 T e criticism can be divided into two main categories. 4 T e f rst is internal criticism, examining proportionality from within. T e second is external criticism, examining proportionality from a larger legal context. Each of these critiques will be referred to individually. T is chapter strives to provide a satisfactory retort. In any event – and that, at the end of the day, is the very basis of my replies – the suggested alternatives are no better. In fact, their defects exceed those of proportionality.

### **B. Internal criticism**

### 1. T e nature of the internal criticism

T e internal criticism on proportionality can be described from two separate viewpoints. 5 T e f rst focuses on the lack of standards by which proportionality stricto sensu can be determined; the second focuses on the non-rational nature of the balancing component on which proportionality stricto sensu is based. A closer look, however, reveals that these two viewpoints are, in fact, two dif erent aspects of the same argument. According to this claim, the balancing act – on which proportionality is based – is nothing but a manifestation of intuition and improvisation. 6 It has neither consistency nor coherence. 7 It lacks accuracy. In fact, it is based on a false sense of a scientif c method which stems from the unsuccessful use of balancing and weight metaphors. 8T ese arguments will be addressed in turn.

### 2. T e lack of a standard by which proportionality can be examined

### i. T e issue of incommensurability

T e main point of this line of criticism is that in order to balance between competing principles they should be based on a common denominator. T is common denominator is impossible to f nd since the conficting principles do not have a common denominator. T ey are incommensurable. 9 T erefore, the entire edif ce of balancing rests on a false premise,

Rev . 1168 ( 1998 ). See also F. Schauer, "Commensurability

and is therefore destined to fail. 10 In referring to balancing, Justice Scalia has noted:

> [T]he scale analogy is not really appropriate, since the interests on both sides are incommensurate. It is more like judging whether a particular line is longer than a particular rock is heavy. 11

 According to this approach, for the balancing to be successful there must be a hierarchy of principles. Alas, this hierarchy simply does not exist. 12 All attempts to establish one have failed. 13 In this situation there is no room to conduct any kind of balancing. T e balancing metaphor remains empty, with no substantial content.

### ii. A retort

 I accept the premise that in order to conduct a balance, a common denominator is required. 14 T is common denominator does not have to be quantitative. All that is required is that a shared basis for evaluating the result of the balance exists. 15 T e development of the common law is nothing but the continuous historical process of balancing between

competing principles. If this balancing is possible within the conf nes of the common law, there is no reason to assume it is not so in constitutional law. At the foundation of the constitutional balance lie the marginal social importance in fulf lling one principle and the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to another principle. 16 Accordingly, whenever the two ends of the scale contain constitutional rights, a balancing is carried out between the marginal social importance gained by the protection of one constitutional right and the marginal social importance gained by preventing more harm to the other constitutional right. When the public interest is on one side of the balance (such as national security or public safety) and on the other side we f nd a constitutional right (such as freedom of expression or human dignity), the comparison is between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by advancing the public interest and the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by preventing the harm to the constitutional right. T us, a shared base – or a common denominator – exists; it is in the form of the marginal social importance in fulf lling the public purpose and the marginal social importance in preventing the harm to the constitutional right. T e question is whether the marginal social importance of the benef ts to one constitutional principle is important enough to justify the marginal social importance in preventing the harm caused to the other. T is contextual presentation of the issue provides the common denominator – the relative social importance – required to conduct the balance. T e metaphors of balancing and weight thus receive substantive content. 17

foundation. 19 It is not based on any rigorous criteria. 20 In addition, it lacks an objective component and instead relies entirely on subjective considerations of the person conducting the balance (be it a legislator, judge, or a member of the executive branch 21 ). T erefore, similar cases receive dif erent solutions and therefore the notion of balancing is arbitrary. 22

### ii. A retort

T e argument that proportionality lacks a rational basis has not been lef unanswered. T e answer is that balancing is carried out in accordance with rational standards. 23 Of course, the act of balancing may in some cases confer a limited measure of discretion upon the person conducting it (be it the legislator, the judge, 24 or a member of the executive branch). But, the very existence of the element of discretion does not render the act irrational. 25 So long as the discretion operates within well-def ned rational standards, the decision reached through them is rational. Indeed, the rationality of the act of balancing is derived from the existence of a rational justif cation for the balancing act and cannot be denied merely through discretion's existence. As Kumm has argued, 26 proportionality

ref ects a rational human right paradigm: it imposes on public authorities the burden to justify a limitation on a constitutional right in terms of public reason. It provides a structure for the assessment of public reasons. Kumm points out that reasoning about rights means reasoning about how a particular value relates to the exigencies of the circumstances. It requires general practical reasoning as it applies to a particular context.

T e rational justif cation for the balancing act is found in the basic rule, according to which a proper balance compares between the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by fulf lling the public interest or protecting another constitutional right and the marginal social importance of the benef ts gained by preventing the harm to the constitutional right as a result. 27 T e said balancing is not based upon logical syllogism. T e lack of syllogism does not mean a lack of rationality. Subjective components of exercising discretion do not deny rationality.

T ere are those who claim that the concept of balancing presents itself as (or at least creates a fa ç ade of having) scientif c accuracy; while it is actually based on judicial subjectivity. 28 T is argument cannot be accepted. 29 As for the "fa ç ade," it should be noted that it was never argued that the act of balancing is scientif c, or that it completely eliminates judicial discretion. Rather, the judicial discretion exercised in the process of balancing is always limited and is never arbitrary. 30 T us, even where subjective elements are used, these operate within limited conf nes and only in order to achieve proper purposes. 31 Moreover, judicial discretion must fulf ll general principles of judicial coherence and judicial consistency. It must respect the principle of stare decisis . It must ref ect the fundamental values of the legal system. 32 It is transparent and open to criticism and review by the legal community. In fact, balancing brings – rather than confusion – a sense of order and method into constitutional law analysis. It forces the judge to identify the relevant principles and to provide a justif cation for the right's limitation. It requires the judge to deal with the marginal social importance. It forces the judge to expose, both to themselves and to others, their train of thought. It allows for both independent, internal criticism as well as external review. 33

T e act of balancing is not merely a judicial technique. It is also a mental process. It is an expression of the complexity of human nature, as well as the complexity of human relations. T e law is not an "all or nothing" approach. T e law is a complex system of principles, which in some cases all point in the same direction while in other cases are in a state of conf ict and require judicial resolution. T e rule of balancing expresses this complexity. 34

### **C. External criticism**

### 1. Too wide a judicial discretion

### i. T e nature of the criticism

T e argument here is that proportionality – and, in particular, the balancing conducted within proportionality stricto sensu – provides the judge with too wide a discretion. 35 As a result, judicial certainty is damaged 36 as there is no way to predict the results in advance. 37

### ii. A retort

 I agree that, in some cases, there is no possibility of conducting a balance without a component of judicial discretion. 38 T ere is no way to solve this conf ict without judicial discretion. T e critique should prove that the discretion exercised by judges in a balance is wider than that granted to them in the proposed alternatives for resolving conf icts between competing principles. T at is not the argument of ered. A more adequate argument would show that the use of this seemingly too wide a discretion leads to negative ef ects. T is kind of proof was not given and it is unlikely that it

Government," 100 Harv. L. Rev . 4, 34 (1986). 35 See M. V. Tushnet, "Anti-Formalism in Recent Constitutional T eory," 83 Mich. L. Rev . 1502, 1508 ( 1985 ); I.

exists. Indeed, even the American model – based on categorization 39 – is based on judicial discretion. 40 It was never demonstrated that such categorization reduces the discretion, or that it leads to more judicial certainty, or provides a better opportunity to predict the results. As noted, proportionality makes transparent legal decisions. Categorization tends to be less transparent. T e reasons underlying the categorical choice are typically not made explicit. Today, most constitutional democracies use balancing, and there is no proof that their judicial discretion is wider than that used by American judges. Finally, it was never demonstrated that the legal certainty in the United States is greater than that of ered by those countries using balancing.

### 2. Insuf cient protection of constitutional rights

### i. T e nature of the criticism

 Several commentators, ref ecting dif erent opinions, have criticized proportionality for not providing enough protection to human rights. 41 One type of criticism derives from an understanding of rights which is critical to the concept of balancing. According to that criticism, rights should not be balanced away based on proportionality considerations. T ere are those, like Dworkin, who deem rights to be "trumps," which prevail over policy relating to the public interest. 42 According to this view, only in extreme and special circumstances, which require a unique justif cation, can a right be limited. Habermas views rights as f rewalls, which protect the individual from the community. 43 T ese approaches are quite suspicious of the concept of proportionality. In fact, they view proportionality as a tool for limiting human rights rather than as an instrument designed to protect them. 44 T e second type of criticism claims that, even

if on the level of political morality proportionality provides the right kind of structure, courts are likely to cave in under pressure if their only ground to resist public authorities claiming that something is necessary and appropriate in the face of majority public policy concerns is a highly indeterminate proportionality structure. It is frequently argued that the categorization used in the American model provides more robust protection to human rights than the two-stage proportionality model which distinguishes between the scope of the right and the extent of its protection. T is argument rests on the assumption that, whenever the protection of the constitutional right depends on a specif c balancing process, considerations relating to the public interest will usually prevail over individual (or minority) rights. 45 T is argument is said to apply primarily during times of national emergency, 46 but may also apply during quiet periods when an individual right conf icts with the public interest. As Niemmer has noted:

> It is too much to expect that our judges will be entirely untouched, consciously or otherwise, by such strong popular feelings – feelings that have more than once reached a point of national hysteria – when they come to engage in the "delicate and dif cult task" of weighing competing interests. T us at the very time when the right of freedom of speech becomes crucial, the scales may become unbalanced. 47

 Gunther even went so far as to suggest that balancing is equal to "abdication of the judicial responsibility for the protection of civil liberties," 48 whereas Webber claimed that judicial balancing limits the very idea of a constitution. 49

### ii. A retort

 Regarding the f rst type of criticism, my answer is that there is nothing in the methodology of proportionality which contradicts a liberal antiperfectionist or anticollectivist democratic tradition. 50 Proportionality is a legal framework that must be f lled with content. It allows for dif erent

levels of protection, according to the principles and values of each legal system. T us, for example, each system determines its own content with regard to the threshold test of the proper purpose. T is could establish a high standard (as in Canada 51 ) or a low standard (as in Germany 52 ). T e same is true for the threshold requirement of the rational connection test and the necessity requirement; dif erent levels may be established by different countries. T e balancing, which is performed as part of proportionality stricto sensu , ref ects the importance that each legal system ascribes to the marginal social benef ts gained by fulf llment of the proper purpose and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right in question. 53 T is marginal importance varies from one legal system to another and from one period to the next. T ere is no reason to assume a priori that this justif cation is "weaker" in systems that have adopted proportionality. Indeed, the component of proportionality stricto sensu may well incorporate the notions of "rights as trumps," or "rights as f rewalls." As for the second type of criticism, it requires a comparison between the protection of constitutional rights under proportionality and their protection under proportionality's alternatives. T is comparison will be carried out in Chapter 19 , mainly by comparing proportionality to the American categorization. T e conclusion there is that the claim that human rights are better protected in the United States than in legal systems where the proportionality regime applies is without merit.

### **D. Lack of judicial legitimacy**

### 1. T e nature of the criticism

 According to this argument, balancing between competing interests is the legislator's job. 54 Accordingly, a judge performing that task is "trespassing" on legislative territory. 55 T e judge, according to this argument,

<sup>51</sup> See above, at 281. 52 See below, at 529. 53 See above, at 350.

<sup>54</sup> See Shaman, above note 15, at 155; Webber, above note 1.

Porat, "Why All Attempts to Make Judicial Review Balancing Principled Fail" (Paper presented at the VIIth World Congress of the International Association of Constitutional Law, Athens, June 14, 2007 ); C. Ducat, Modes of Constitutional Interpretation ( 1978 ), 119.

turns himself into a super-legislator, 56 thus violating the principle of the separation of powers. 57 Hence, one may deduce the need to avoid judicial balancing or that it should be conducted, if at all, only in the most extreme of circumstances. 58 In essence, this argument is about judicial democratic "def ciency." Another argument, in the same vein, is that the court lacks the institutional capacity to conduct the balance. T e judge's point of view – due to the inherent nature of the judicial process – is too narrow. His ability to deal with empirical data is limited. 59

### 2. A retort

T e formal reply to the argument about the lack of judicial legitimacy in conducting the balance is that the authority to exercise judicial review, as well as the authority to balance between competing principles (within the limitation clause), is anchored in the constitution. T e court did not take on this authority for itself. It was granted to the court by the constitution (either explicitly or implicitly). In the same manner by which the constitution conferred upon the legislator the power to legislate, it also provided the judge with the authority to review that legislation. 60

 In addition to this formal answer, there is another, more substantive reply that directly deals with the assumption at the criticism's foundation – that the very nature of the institution of judicial review is undemocratic. T e substantive answer, therefore, focuses on this basic premise of the criticism. T is expansive topic cannot be fully examined within the conf nes of this book. Chapter 17 provides a partial examination of the subject. In essence, judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation is an expression of the democratic nature of the constitution. From the said democratic character of the constitution, as well as from the legislator's duty to fulf ll the constitution's provisions, stems the judiciary's role as the constitution's defender and a protector of human rights, such that those rights would not be unduly limited by the legislator. 61 According to

- 58 See Dennis v. United States , 341 US 494, 525 (1951). 59 See Porat, above note 35.
<sup>56</sup> See Ducat, above note 22, at 130.

Disagreement (Oxford University Press, 1999), 255. 61 See J. Paul Muller, "Fundamental Rights in Democracy," 4 Human Rights Law Journal (1983); S. Gardbaum, "A Democratic Defense of Constitutional Balancing," 4(1) Law and Ethics of Hum. Rts . 77 ( 2010 ).

my approach, proportionality generally and balancing in particular are an important judicial tool for protecting a democratic constitution. T e legislator, too, conducts balancing while adopting legislation. By doing so, the legislator is looking to ref ect the very balanced approach adopted by – and inherent to – the constitution. However, it would be inappropriate to provide the legislator with the last word on the constitutionality of the balance it has conducted. T is is the foundation for the institution of judicial review. According to that notion, the institutional structure of the court, its independence, and its distance from day-to-day political pressures, put judicial balancing closer than any other type of balancing to the balancing required by the constitution. 62 Further, the court is fully equipped, both professionally and ethically, to perform the task. In that context, as noted earlier, there is no room for judicial deference. 63 Finally, I could not f nd any other approach – other than proportionality (and its balancing core) – that would be able to guarantee both the appropriate status of the legislature and the appropriate status of human rights in the system. 64 Accordingly, the real issue is not whether we should adopt proportionality or another method to review legislation's constitutionality. T e real question is whether to have judicial review of the law's constitutionality or to have no review at all. T e real matter is not whether proportionality – with balancing at its core – is an appropriate method. T e only relevant question is whether the institution of judicial review is proper. To that question the reply is a resounding "yes." Judicial review protects and defends democracy, by both the formal and substantive meanings of the term, and protects human rights. 65T e power of the legislature to legislate is not absolute. It is subject to the limitations imposed by constitutional human rights. T e courts protect those rights through judicial review. Kumm has emphasized that the constitutional legitimacy of the legislature is enforced not only through the people's vote, but also through the judicial review of independent judges. 66

# Alternatives to proportionality

 Proportionality is a legal tool designed to resolve conf icts between constitutional rights, or conf icts between constitutional rights and the public interest. It is not the only tool designed to provide such solutions. Other legal tools also seek to provide solutions to these conf icts. T is chapter will review some of these alternatives, particularly the alternative referred to as "categorization," which is frequently used by American courts. Before categorization is reviewed, however, several other alternatives are presented.

### **A. Non-categorization-based alternatives**

### 1. Absolute rights

### i. T e nature of the alternative

 Webber proposed an alternative to proportionality. 1 According to his approach, the scope of constitutional rights is determined as per their interpretation. T is scope is supplemented by limitations constructed by the legislator. T ose limitations are a part of the constitutional right. T ey do not limit it. Rather, they determine its content in accordance with the community's views at a given time. T ese views are expressed through legislation, which expresses the people's will. T e legislator operates in accordance with the limitation clause. According to this clause, the legislator must demonstrate the justif cation for the right as it exists in a free and democratic society. T e legislator, in other words, is the one to determine the boundaries of the right. Once these boundaries are set (in accordance with the right's proper interpretation and the limitations set by legislation), the right becomes absolute. T us, neither proportionality nor the balancing at its core has a place. Indeed, the legislator is not bound

<sup>1</sup> See G. C. N. Webber, T e Negotiable Constitution: On the Limitation of Rights (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 1087, 1088.

by proportionality. Accordingly, the role of the judicial branch is to examine whether or not the use of legislative discretion was arbitrary.

 At the core of Webber's approach is the notion that a constitutional right's content ref ects a continuing process. T is content expresses the ongoing negotiation between members of society, as ref ected by limitations imposed on the right by the legislator from time to time. T ose legislative limitations thus become a part of the right. T e judicial role, to the extent it exists, is very limited. T us proportionality and the notion of balancing are "foreign" to this concept of a democratic process.

### ii. Assessment of the alternative

 Webber's alternative – as well as his negative approach to proportionality and balancing – is predicated on his own view of constitutional rights. T is view, however, seems unfounded. T e accepted and proper view considers constitutional rights as a shield to protect individuals from the tyranny of the majority, as ref ected by the legislator. Webber, in contrast, views the scope of constitutional rights as determined by the legislator – the very same body that expresses that type of tyranny of the majority. T e limitations on the power to legislate, according to Webber, are limited. It seems that, according to Webber, there is no room for a constitutional bill of rights; there is no real need to limit the legislative power regarding human rights; there is no need for judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation limiting constitutional rights; and therefore, obviously, there is no need for proportionality – or the balancing at its core – to set boundaries for the limitations of constitutional rights. Webber's approach not only presents an alternative to proportionality, it is an alternative to the entire accepted notion of constitutional rights.

 Webber's perception of the constitution – as an ongoing process of negotiations between society's members, which is determined by the legislator – renders the constitutional bill of rights devoid of its powers to protect the individual from the tyranny of the majority. What appears to be a right at the constitutional level is, in fact, a right operating at the subconstitutional level. T e tasks of both interpreting the scope of the right and setting its limits are provided to the legislator, and to the legislator alone. T e cancellation of the accepted two-stage approach (a constitutional level and a legislative level) creates a single level that, in fact, is of a sub-constitutional level. And, while it is true that the legislator is not permitted to change the wording of the constitutional right, it is otherwise permitted to act as it pleases.

 Webber's approach is unique, and very original. A similar approach was not found in any constitution or in the comparative literature. Even systems that do not accept the concept of proportionality, such as the United States, do not grant the legislator as wide a discretion as Webber advocates. Similarly, neither Habermas, Nozik, nor Dworkin – all brought forward by Webber in support of his criticism of proportionality – have ever adopted Webber's approach. Clearly, any legal system that would adopt such an approach is seriously risking undermining the constitutional nature of its rights. T erefore, Webber does not of er any real alternative to proportionality and balancing; instead, he presents an alternative to the constitutional nature of the bill of rights.

T ere is a close connection between Webber and Waldron's approaches. 2 T ey both deny judicial review of a statute's constitutionality. As already mentioned in Chapters 16 and 17 , judicial review is proper. However, Webber's approach is more extreme than Waldron's. It seems that Webber provides the legislator with powers (through the interpreting of the scope of constitutional rights) which according to Waldron require a constitutional amendment. Waldron does not oppose what he refers to as weak judicial review as it exists in his opinion in England (through a declaration of incompatibility), 3 which it seems that Webber opposes. Webber's approach is therefore characteristically extreme. It does not take human rights seriously. Nor does it take democracy seriously, as it does not protect the individual's right vis-à-vis the public – a protection found in democracy's foundation.

 Webber's approach is based on the notion of absolute human rights. T is absolutism operates vis-à-vis the judicial branch. It does not operate vis-à-vis the legislator. T e legislator is authorized to limit those rights. Webber emphasizes time and again his notion that the legislator's

2 See J. Waldron, "T e Core of the Case Against Judicial Review," 115 Yale L. J . 1346 ( 2006 ). See also R. Bellamy, Political Constitutionalism: A Republican Defense of the Constitutionality of Democracy (Cambridge University Press, 2007 ). 3

 See Waldron, above note 2, at 1355. See also A. Kavanagh, Constitutional Review under the UK Human Rights Act (Cambridge University Press, 2009 ), 416, who argues that under the UK Human Rights Act judicial review is of a strong form. See above, at 160. Waldron noted that judicial review of legislation in Canada is not proper despite the existence of the override clause: Waldron, above note 2, at 1356. T is approach has been criticized: see J. Goldsworthy, "Judicial Review, Legislative Override, and Democracy," 38 Wake Forest L. R . 451 (2003); D. Dyzenhaus, "T e Incoherence of Constitutional Positivism," in G. Huscrot (ed.), Expounding the Constitution: Essays in Constitutional T eory (Cambridge University Press, 2008), 138, 140. T is criticism is justif ed. T e justif cation or criticism of constitutional review is related to the legislator's power and not to his ability, or lack thereof, to use the said power.

limitations constitute a development of the right rather than its limitation. T is distinction, however, renders the dif erence between the development of and the limitation of a right nearly superf uous. It seems that, in most cases where courts have declared legislative provisions unconstitutional for their disproportional limitation of a constitutional right, Webber would have understood these as the development of the constitutional right. T e absoluteness of the constitutional right according to Webber is trivial at best. 4 Such a view, in practice, is not that dif erent from that which considers every constitutional right as absolute if the courts have agreed that its limitation was proportional.

### 2. Protecting the core of the constitutional right

## i. T e nature of the alternative

 While Webber's "absolute rights" alternative to proportionality seeks to turn all rights into absolutes, the "protection of the right's core" alternative views only the right's "core" as an absolute. Anything within that "core," according to this alternative, cannot be limited. T is is protected to the full extent of its scope. Proportionality applies only to what is not included in the core. T e historical origin of this approach can be found in German law. 5 Article 19(2) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany reads (in its of cial translation):

> In no case may the essential content ( Wesensgehalt ) of a basic right be encroached upon.

 Following the German example, several constitutions have adopted similar provisions, including the constitutions of Turkey, 6 Portugal, 7 Spain, 8 and the Federal Constitution of Switzerland. 9

- 5 See L. Wildhaber, "Limitations on Human Rights in Times of Peace, War and Emergency: A Report on Swiss Law," in A. de Mestral, S. Birks, M. Both et al . (eds.), T e Limitation of Human Rights in Comparative Constitutional Law (Montreal: Les Editions Yvon Blais, 1986); R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (J. Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]), 192; M. Sachs, GG Verfassungsrecht II Grundrechte (Berlin: Springer, 2003 ), 734; G. Van der Schyf , "Cutting to the Core of Conf icting Rights: T e Question of Inalienable Cores in Comparative Perspectives," in E. Brems (ed.), Conf icts Between Fundamental Rights (Mortsel, Belgium: Intersentia, 2008), 131. 6
- Constitution of the Republic of Turkey, Art. 13.
- 7 Constitution of Portugal, Art. 18(3).
- 8 Constitution of Spain, Art. 53(1).
- 9 Federal Constitution of Switzerland, Art. 36(4).

<sup>4</sup> See above, at 27.

T e application of each of those provisions requires a determination, for each constitutional right, of the right's core (or its nuclear substance) and which parts constitute the penumbra. Such a determination should be based on the values and principles that the right is meant to advance. 10

 An important question in this context is whether the test of the limitation is subjective or objective. 11 According to the objective test, the question of the right's core is determined from the viewpoint of the legal system as a whole, while considering the potential victims of the limitation. According to this approach, the right's core is af ected in cases where the right loses much of its signif cance in relation to all, or the vast majority of, a given community. T us, for example, a statute prohibiting a police of cer from killing another person under certain circumstances does not limit the core of the right to life of the general public. According to the subjective test, the question of the right's core is determined from the viewpoint of the victim – the limited person. According to this approach, the right's core is limited when the right has lost its signif cance in relation to the specif c individual.

T ere are those who believe that no comprehensive answer should be given to the question of subjective versus objective tests. According to this approach, the answer varies in accordance with the right's nature. 12 T us, for example, the core of the right to life should be determined by an objective test, while the core of the right to bodily integrity should be determined by a subjective test.

- ii. T e rules of proportionality and the right's core
 Does proportionality play any role in determining whether a limitation pertains to the right's core? 13 Opinions on this issue vary. 14 Some are of the opinion that the restriction imposed on limiting a right's core

<sup>10</sup> See E. Orucu, "T e Core of Rights and Freedoms: T e Limit of Limits," in T. Campbell

<sup>(</sup>ed.), Human Rights: From Rhetoric to Reality (New York: Basil Blackwell, 1986 ), 187. 11 See Alexy, above note 5, at 192; Sachs, above note 5, at 735. See also G. Van der Schyf , Limitation of Rights: A Study of the European Convention and the South African Bill of Rights (Nijmegen, T e Netherlands: Wolf Legal Publishers, 2005), 164; B. Pieroth and B. Schlink, Gdundrechte Staatsrecht II (Heidelberg: C. F. M ü ller Verlag, 2006 ), 70. 12 See Pieroth and Schlink, above note 11.

Intensity of Review," 65 Cambridge L. J . 174 ( 2006 ). 14 See Van der Schyf , above note 11, at 167; Sachs, above note 5, at 735. See also K. Hesse, Grundzüge des Verfassungsrechts der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Heidelberg: Die Deutsche Bibliotek, 1999 ), § 333.

creates an "absolute" constraint on the possibility of limiting that right. According to that opinion, proportionality plays no role in determining the nature of this limitation; any limitation of the right's core, in and of itself, is equivalent to an amendment to the right. 15 T e prohibition of the ef ect on the rights core applies even if the limitation is proportional. 16 Others believe that the restriction on limiting the right's core is not "absolute" but rather "partial," and is derived from its context. According to this approach, the rules of proportionality determine whether the limitation was "authorized," and therefore the said determination would be the result of the balance struck between conf icting values and principles. 17

T e dif erence in opinions between these two approaches is, to a large extent, artif cial. It seems that those who favor the "absolute" approach to the notion of the right's core f nd it dif cult to def ne the exact contours of that "core." At the end of the day, they may consider a limitation to be of the right's core only when such a limitation is disproportional. 18

### iii. Assessment of the alternative

 Is this approach proper? It seems that the answer is no. 19 As the comparative law experience has shown, legal systems have dif culties def ning the "core." At the end of the day, it seems that the "core" is best understood in terms of proportionality. 20 If that is the case, why not simply determine that the rules of proportionality should apply to limitations on every part of the right, core and penumbra alike? T e dif erence between a limitation on the right's core and its penumbra is expressed through the rules of proportionality, in particular proportionality stricto sensu . South Africa's 1993 Interim Constitution included a provision prohibiting a limitation on the right's core, 21 but that provision was removed from the (permanent) 1996 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.

See K. Hesse, Grundzüge des Verfassungsrechts der Bundesrepublik Deutschland (Heidelberg: Die Deutsche Bibliotek, 1999 ), § 333. 21 Art. 33(1)(b).

### 3. T e dual model

### i. T e nature of the alternative

T e right's "core" alternative distinguishes between limitations pertaining to the core of each right and those pertaining to its penumbra. T e right's core is protected in an absolute manner. Proportionality may not apply to it. It is only outside the contours of the right's core that proportionality may apply. Another view, with apparent similarities, is Porat's "dual model." 22 Much like the "core model," Porat distinguishes within every right, between a situation where proportionality can apply and a situation where the right is absolutely protected such that proportionality cannot apply. However, the "dual model" and the "right's core" model are dif erent. T e core model seeks to characterize the limitation placed on the constitutional right – whether it pertains to the right's core or to its penumbra. T e dual model seeks to characterize the nature of the conf ict which led to the limitation, while remaining indif erent to the issue of whether said limitation pertains to the right's core or penumbra. What are these considerations?

T e dual model is a synthesis between two theoretical paradigms, one proposed by Raz 23 and the other by Kelman. 24 Porat distinguishes between two types of conf ict: a f rst-order conf ict and a second-order, or exclusionary, conf ict. First-order conf icts are characterized by the fact that they are conf icts between a constitutional right and a limited-resources interest (such as a budget). A second-order conf ict typically takes the form of a constitutional right conf icting with an interest that should not be taken into consideration at all. According to the dual model, the f rst conf ict is resolved through balancing between the conf icting interests. T e second conf ict is not resolved through balancing but rather through the preference of the right over the conf icting interest. T e conf icting interest is completely "excluded" from consideration.

 Porat demonstrates the dual model's application to the American Bill of Rights. He examines, among others, the right to freedom of expression. 25 A f rst-order conf ict exists whenever the right to freedom of expression clashes with a public interest which limits the right for reasons that are

<sup>22</sup> See I. Porat, "T e Dual Model of Balancing: A Model for the Proper Scope of Balancing in

Constitutional Law," 27 Cardozo L. Rev . 1393. 23 See J. Raz, Practical Reasons and Norms , 2nd edn. (Oxford University Press, 1999 ). 24 See M. Kelman, "Market Discrimination and Groups," 53 Stan. L. Rev . 833 ( 2001 ). 25 See Porat, above note 22, at 1417.

content-neutral. T is conf ict is resolved through balancing. 26 A secondorder conf ict exists between freedom of expression and the public interest limiting it for content-related reasons. T is conf ict is not resolved through balancing. 27

### ii. Assessment of the alternative

 Porat's dual model is interesting. Although it seeks to explain the role of proportionality in American law, it can be given a more general application. However, it seems that, in principle, the model can be located within the concept of proportionality itself. T us, a f rst-order conf ict f nds its place in the component of proportionality stricto sensu (balancing). Similarly, each case of a conf ict between two constitutional rights – a conf ict that according to the dual model raises a f rst-order conf ict – would be resolved (on the sub-constitutional level) through the rules of proportionality, and in particular through proportionality stricto sensu . A second-order conf ict can also be easily incorporated into proportionality, this time through the proper purpose requirement. T us, considerations related to the actual content of the speech – which, according to Porat, render the balance moot – may simply be referred to as considerations that do not constitute a proper purpose and therefore do not require any balancing.

 What, then, is the contribution of the dual model? In the context of f rst-order conf icts, the model recognizes the need for balancing and therefore easily integrates into proportionality. T e dif erence between proportionality and the dual model may arise regarding second-order conf icts. Take, for example, a limitation on the right to freedom of expression for reasons of national security. T is is a second-order conf ict. According to the dual model, there is no room for balancing. National security considerations are not part of the considerations that can be considered. In contrast, according to proportionality, these considerations may constitute, under the right circumstances, a proper purpose, and thus are "fair game" for balancing. T e constitutionality of a limitation due to such considerations, therefore, would be determined in accordance with proportionality. In some cases, this limitation is constitutional, while in others it would be declared unconstitutional. T is is the framework that is proper. Indeed, some national security considerations are

<sup>26</sup> T rough the doctrine of "time, place, and manner." See Schneider v. State , 308 US 147 (1939). 27 See Abrams v. United States , 250 US 616 (1919); Texas v. Johnson , 491 US 397 (1989).

worthy of balancing; in contrast, under the dual model, they should never be balanced. Furthermore, even if one were to argue that in rare cases the dual model would be willing to recognize the need to consider them, then the conclusion must be that there is no justif cation for a separate model external to proportionality. Instead of developing rules to distinguish between conf icts of the f rst and second order, it would make more sense to simply apply the traditional rules of proportionality.

 An interesting approach in this regard is Meyerson's. She too dif erentiates between f rst-order considerations and second-order considerations. According to her approach, second-order considerations should be softened. T e sof ening is expressed by the fact that not every second-order consideration is one that should not be considered. T ose second-order considerations which can be considered should be given a "light" weight. In her opinion, this is the case where constitutional rights conf ict with a public interest. T e public interest should be given less weight in the balance. As a result of this, only in special cases will the public interest overcome the constitutional right: 28

> I want to suggest that we should see a bill of rights as a source of secondorder or reweighting reasons. Such reasons would instruct judges not to exercise their own judgement as to what the balance of reasons requires, but rather to assign a greater weight to rights and a lesser weight to the public interest than they would ordinarily think they deserve. Such an approach would acknowledge that bills of rights do not exclude consideration of the public interest, but would also build into rights adjudication a "systematic bias" against permitting the infringement of rights. T e public interest is therefore a "viable opponent" – as required by the non-absolute character of rights – but one operating with a handicap. I will call this the "reweighting approach". Whereas the balancing model sees a bill of rights as merely adding rights to the overall mix of reasons which judges are obliged to consider at the f rst-order level, the reweighting approach sees a bill of rights as operating at the second-order level – as an instruction to depart from the weights which judges would accord if they were operating at the f rst-order level.

T is approach "improves" the dual model. It can be expressed in the framework of the basic balancing rule. Within this rule it can be determined that the relative social importance of preventing the limitation of the constitutional right should be given more weight than the relative social importance in advancing the public interest. I am not convinced

<sup>28</sup> D. Meyerson, "Why Courts Should Not Balance Rights against the Public Interest." 31 Melb. U. L. Rev . 873 ( 2007 ), 883.

this approach is justif ed. It is suf cient to consider the relative social importance, without adding additional considerations regarding the relative weight. Every legal system will give its own weight – ref ecting its history and tradition – to its constitutional rights.

### **B. Te categorization-based alternatives**

### 1. Categorization within the human rights discourse

 Proportionality's critics, as a standard for the limitation of rights, do not limit themselves to criticism alone. Some point to alternatives that they believe to be more proper. As we have seen, Webber, for example, of ers to replace judicial proportionality with legislative construction. 29 Another alternative was of ered by Schlink, who suggests that, in cases involving judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation (as opposed to the constitutionality of administrative acts), proportionality should be narrowed so that it does not contain the component of proportionality stricto sensu . 30 But, if the executive branch is subject to proportionality when it limits constitutional rights, why should the legislative branch not be subject to the same need for justif cation? T e major threats to constitutional rights come from legislation that authorizes the executive to limit constitutional rights. If these limitations are free from judicial review, the whole idea of the judicial review of legislation collapses.

T e most important alternative of ered to proportionality, by far, is that of categorization. T is alternative is used in many areas of American constitutional law. What is this alternative, and are its advantages greater than its disadvantages? Is it preferable to proportionality? T is question is posed to anyone engaged in the adoption of a new constitution. Does categorization have any signif cance in a constitution which has explicitly recognized proportionality as the standard by which a right's limitation should be measured? T e answer to this question is complex. Obviously, in those legal systems which recognize the concept of proportionality, categorization cannot replace proportionality. T e latter would require a constitutional amendment. However, categorization can still af ect the interpretation of rights and the constitutional limitation clause. Such an

ef ect may manifest itself in dif erent contexts. T us, for example, it may af ect the scope of the rights. 31 It may also af ect the answer to the interpretive question of whether the public interest or the rights of others, which conf ict with the protected constitutional right, should be considered part of providing meaning to the scope of the protected rights. Categorization may also af ect the question of whether proportionality should be structured or f exible. 32 It is relevant for the dif erent sub-tests of proportionality. It can be quite inf uential in providing an answer to the question – if the question is recognized by a given legal system – whether proportionality stricto sensu should be used as a standard for limiting constitutional rights. Even if the answer to this question is yes, categorization may still af ect the actual application of proportionality stricto sensu . 33 What is categorization? What is the dif erence between categorization and proportionality in general, and balancing in particular? Does categorization provide better protection to human rights than proportionality? Should it be preferred at a time when a new constitution is adopted, or during the process of interpreting an existing constitution? T ese questions will now be discussed in greater detail.

### 2. T e nature of thinking in legal categories

T inking in categories is one of the earliest forms of human thought. One of the main characteristics of ancient law was thinking in categories. T e classif cation of factual circumstances into a legal category (such as "property" or "marriage") determined the legal outcome. T e transition from the ancient to the modern legal period is thus sometimes perceived as a move from thinking in categories ("status") to thinking in more open terms ("contract"). 34

T inking in categories has, therefore, been an integral part of the development of the law. In recent centuries, however, another form of legal thinking – one relating to interests, or values – began developing. Soon, tension arose between these two forms of legal thought. Both categorization and value-related thinking have been very inf uential in the development of legal thinking. In Europe, for example, the tension between the two models of legal thinking led to the concomitant development of "concept jurisprudence" ( Begrif sjurisprudenz ) 35 and "interest jurisprudence"

Patterson, Jurisprudence: Men and Ideas of the Law (New York: Foundation Press, 1953 ), 459; J. Stone, Province and Function of Law: Law As Logic, Justice and Social

( Interessenjurisprudenz ). 36 A similar tension began to emerge in American law as well. As Morton Horowitz observed: "Nothing captures the essential dif erence between the typical legal minds of nineteenth and twentieth-century America quite as well as their attitude towards categories."37 T is kind of tension can still be observed in today's legal thinking around the world.

 What does "thinking in categorization terms" mean? T inking in categories is a form of interpretive thinking. It seeks to resolve all legal questions through the use – and within the boundaries – of a predetermined legal category. 38 In essence, this is a formalistic type of thinking, focusing on classif cations and attributions. T us, the legal text is divided into several categories, and each category is further divided into sub-categories. 39 Each category and sub-category has its own well-def ned realm of operation. T e main legal issue thus becomes the identif cation of the proper category, and then the application of the factual framework to that proper, pre-determined legal category. Once a category has been chosen, the accompanying set of legal rules will automatically apply. Legal development occurs in the move from one category to another, by creating new categories, or by modifying and amending the understanding of existing categories.

T inking in legal categories does not require the exclusion of policy considerations. Instead, policy considerations have been part of the considerations that led to the creation – and f nal shape – of each legal category. T ose considerations help set the category's boundaries. Once these boundaries have been set, however, there is no need to reexamine the policy considerations that formed the category in the f rst place. It is enough to apply the category – a result of the original policy considerations – in order to solve the legal problem. Accordingly, an examination

of the policy considerations underlying the category would only take place when a new legal development is considered, either by changing the scope of existing categories or in creating new ones. Accordingly, thinking in categories may be creative thinking. Such creativity is expressed through a constant reexamination of the scope, the status, and the application of existing categories, as well as the creation of new ones.

### 3. Constitutional rights in categorized thinking

### i. Every right constitutes its own category

T inking in categories can be applied to every legal f eld. It also applies to the f eld of constitutional law. It holds a special place in the f eld of constitutional rights. T us, categorization seeks to classify each human right, or a specif c part of it, as its own independent category. It seeks to resolve every question relating to such rights through the interpretation of the legal text creating it. It attempts to prevent a situation where one constitutional right (the f rst category) conf icts with another constitutional right (the second category). 40 However, it may view several rights, each of which is an independent category, as sub-categories of a single broader category.

T e distinction between the scope of the right and the extent of its realization has already been discussed, 41 as has the distinction between narrowing the scope of the right and limiting its realization. 42 T ese distinctions are interpreted dif erently in categorization thinking. T e reason for that is that all the provisions – whether relating to expanding or narrowing the right's scope, or regarding the protection of or the limitation of a right – are found within the constitutional text that shapes the right itself. 43

 With this in mind, it is widely accepted today that the US Constitution's Bill of Rights is based substantially – but not exclusively 44 – on the notion of legal categorization. 45 Every right in the American Bill of Rights makes

<sup>40</sup> See R. H. Fallon, "Individual Rights and the Powers of Government," 27 Ga. L. Rev . 343,

up an independent category. However, not everyone agrees with this view. Gardbaum, for one, is of the opinion that the basic structure of the American Bill of Rights is no dif erent than that typically found in other constitutional democracies. 46 For example, in America, rights are shields from – as opposed to trumps over – the public interest. In America, as elsewhere, protection of the right is done in two stages. First, the right's scope is determined, followed by the extent of its protection. Despite the similarities between the legal systems which Gardbaum has pointed out, the methodological dif erence between the American legal system and other systems is substantial; in essence, this dif erence may be summed up as thinking in legal categories. 47 In the United States, the categorical attributes of the right determines the level of constitutional scrutiny; that level of scrutiny, in turn, determines the limitations that may be placed on the rights at issue. T ese limitations are mostly not determined by specif c (or ad hoc ) balancing. 48 T e second stage of American constitutional review does not include specif c balancing. Gardbaum argues that American judges of en turn to balancing within each category. However, to him "balancing" is very broadly def ned, 49 encompassing any limitation on the exercise of the right, including limitations that do not apply proportionality stricto sensu .

ii. Example: freedom of expression in the First Amendment

T e First Amendment to the American Constitution states, regarding freedom of expression:

> Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.

T inking in legal categories would consider this text as forming a category of freedom of speech. T us, every legal question related to freedom of

<sup>48</sup> On specif c balancing, see above, at 367. 49 See Gardbaum, above note 43, at 792.

speech should be considered – and f nd its interpretive solution – within the First Amendment's text. T e signif cant number of cases dealing with, and attempting to interpret, this portion of the First Amendment demonstrates the complexity of the questions the amendment raises. Obviously, such a legal state of af airs places a heavy burden on anyone attempting to resolve these interpretive questions. T is interpretive task is especially burdensome in those cases where the judge attempts, on the one hand, to be loyal to the constitutional text, while, at the same time, providing an answer to many new situations lef uncovered by the "thin" constitutional text.

 Gardbaum seeks to distinguish, within American constitutional law, between the scope of the right and the limitations imposed on its realization. He attempts to determine, through the substantive body of judicial decisions, the content of the First Amendment. At the end of the day, Gardbaum limited himself to those situations where the question was whether some form of expression can be prevented due to its content:

> T e right to be free from intentional, content-based regulation of noneconomic speech or expressive conduct that does not constitute fraud, obscenity, f ghting words, or a clear and present danger unless the regulation necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. 50

 Such language is worthy of praise. However, it does not blur the basic methodological distinction between the American approach and those of other constitutional democracies. Such a distinction is based on the fact that the American approach views freedom of expression as an independent category. T e categorical nature of the reference determines, in turn, the level of constitutional scrutiny. T is scrutiny does not contain, in most cases, the conduct of specif c balancing.

### 4. Categorization and the two-stage model

 Can categorization be reconciled with the two-stage model? T e answer depends, f rst and foremost, on the constitutional text itself. Whenever the constitutional text explicitly determines two stages in a constitutional arrangement, then all forms of interpretive thinking – including categorization – recognize the existence of those two stages. T e question focuses on the constitutional text which does not dif erentiate between the two

50 Ibid ., at 807.

stages. T e First Amendment is an example of this. What should the solution be in those cases?

 It seems that this question has no clear answer. According to Gardbaum's def nition, it is possible to say that the First Amendment is based solely on a single stage. T e limitation clause – which determines the circumstances in which the right can be limited without af ecting its scope – is "integrated" into the def nition of the right itself. However, Gardbaum acknowledges that this is not the only view possible. Other views of the American First Amendment approach may well include a clear distinction between the scope of the right and questions relating to the extent of its protection. According to those views, the American approach may well be reconciled with the two-stage model. 51

### 5. Categorization and balancing

 Methodologically speaking, thinking in legal categories stands in sharp contrast to legal thinking based upon specif c, or ad hoc , balancing. 52 T is was true in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and remains true today. T e focus on categories was meant, among others, to prevent the use of specif c balancing in each case. T e characterization of a set of facts as being attributed to a certain category led to a legal solution, without the need to conduct a specif c balancing within that category. Legal categorization accepts the notion of principled balancing to the extent that it operates at the interpretive level determining the scope of the categories in question and their boundaries. 53 At the core of each legal category is the interpretive balance that preceded its creation. 54

 Take, for example, the right to freedom of speech. Categorization recognizes that in order to determine the boundaries of the right to freedom of speech we should properly balance between the principles underlying the right and the principles opposing it. 55 T e result of such a principled balance would lead, for example, to taking a stand on the question of whether the right to freedom of speech may cover instances of racist

<sup>51</sup> Ibid ., at 609. See also Schauer, above note 38; Schauer, above note 45. 52 Regarding specif c balancing, see above, at 367. 53 See M. B. Nimmer, "T e Right to Speak from Times to Time: First Amendment T eory Applied to Libel and Misapplied to Privacy," 56 Cal. L. Rev . 935 ( 1968 ); R. H. Fallon,

<sup>&</sup>quot;Individual Rights and the Powers of Government," 27 Ga. L. Rev . 343 (1993). 54 See E. Chemerinsky, Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies , 3rd edn. (New York: Aspen Publishers, 2006 ), 539. 55 See Stone Sweet and Mathews, above note 44; Blocher, above note 38.

speech or obscenity. Similarly, a principled balance would determine the answer to the question of in what circumstances would the right to enjoy good reputation prevail over another's right to freedom of speech. But, once the contours of the category – in this example, the contours of the right to freedom of speech regarding its content – are determined, there is no room for additional balancing. Once again, no specif c ( ad hoc ) balancing is conducted to determine the result of a specif c case when freedom of speech was af ected because of its content.

T e obvious result is that the main factor which dif erentiates between legal categorization and proportionality is proportionality stricto sensu . T e act of balancing, which is the very foundation of proportionality stricto sensu , separates and distinguishes proportionality as a method of legal thinking from legal categorization. In particular, the distinguishing factor is the conduct of specif c ( ad hoc ) balancing, relating directly to the circumstances of each and every case separately. Specif c balancing is the basis of the main dif erence between the two modes of constitutional thought. T e rest of proportionality's components (proper purpose, rational means, and the lack of a less restrictive alternative) may well be considered a part of categorization as well. T is will be demonstrated through a review of the American approach to constitutional rights in greater detail.

### 6. Categorization and human rights in American constitutional law

i. American categorization

**a. Tree categories** T e US Constitution's Bill of Rights mostly contains no limitation clauses, whether general or specif c. Most rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights are expressed in absolute terms and each right constitutes its own category. However, the similarities between the enumerated rights enabled the development of three categories, to which most rights may be attributed. T ese three categories are typif ed by the dif erent levels of judicial scrutiny attached to each of them. 56 T e three categories are: rights whose limitation invites strict scrutiny; rights whose limitation invites intermediate scrutiny; and rights whose limitation invites minimal scrutiny. Each of these super categories will be examined brief y. Along with those three categories there are additional categories,

<sup>56</sup> See L. H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law , 2nd edn. (New York: Foundation Press, 1998), 769. See also Chemerinsky, above note 54, at 539.

but these will not be dealt with here. Similarly, there is an understanding – expressed by only a small number of justices – that there is no room for this strict division of categories. 57 Even in the framework of the categories dealt with here, the analysis is very brief – perhaps too brief. T e American literature on the subject is voluminous, and extremely varied. Summarizing each of the views presented in the literature is a task far beyond the contours of this book. All that can be done here is to provide a quick "X-ray image" of the issue, while examining its comparison to proportionality. It is obvious that the analysis here does not do the complexity of the issue any justice, and may not even present it accurately enough; nor does it do any justice to the American approach, which is made up of a vast array of rules and exceptions that are nearly impossible to summarize as needed for this book. In addition, the analysis herein refers to the American law currently in use. A historical review is not of ered. T is review teaches that in the past there was room for balancing within the judicial review of a limitation of a constitutional right. 58 Finally, even in today's approach, there are judicial voices, a minority, which recognize the balancing. 59

 **b. Strictscrutiny** T e f rst category is the category of rights known in American law as fundamental rights. T is category includes rights such as freedom of political speech, the rights to demonstrate and to associate, the freedom to exercise religion, the freedom to move freely within US borders, and the right to elect representatives. In addition to these fundamental rights, this category also entails any government action relating to "suspect classif cation" based on race or national origin. Any attempt to regulate (that is, to limit) those rights would invite a judicial "strict scrutiny" – the most stringent level of constitutional review. 60T is review applies to both the purposes underlying the limiting legislation as well as the means selected to fulf ll that purpose. As for the purposes, precedent determines that a law limiting one of the rights in this category would be declared unconstitutional unless it was enacted to justify a compelling governmental (or state) interest, a pressing public necessity, or a substantial state interest. T e means used to achieve the purpose should be

"necessary." T is means that they should be "narrowly tailored" to achieve the compelling interest at stake. 61 T e "narrowly tailored" requirement is two-pronged: f rst, that there is no other means that would be less restrictive of the right in question; 62 and, second, that those means are not "too wide," a prohibition on overinclusiveness or overbreadth. 63

**c. Intermediate scrutiny** T e second category, 64 that of "intermediate" scrutiny, includes: the right to equality – in those cases where the limitation was based upon "quasi-suspect" classif cations such as gender or age; the limitation of the right to freedom of commercial speech; and the right to speech in a public forum. Legislation included in this category would pass constitutional muster if it was designed to achieve an important governmental objective. T e means used to fulf ll the purpose must reveal a substantial relation between the purpose and the means used for its realization.

 **d. Minimal scrutiny** T e last category 65 – "minimal" scrutiny – applies to the remaining constitutional rights. It includes, for example, any limitation of equality which is not based on suspect or quasi-suspect

classif cations; and rights such as the right to movement outside the country. According to American precedent, it is suf cient that the legislation was designed to achieve a legitimate governmental purpose. T ere is no need to examine the purpose's urgency. Regarding the means, they must have a rational basis. T is rational basis is determined while considering the possible results and alternatives. 66

**e. Categories with no ad hoc balancing** A review of each of the three categories as they are understood in contemporary American jurisprudence 67 shows that the limitation of a constitutional right is not based upon any specif c, or ad hoc , balancing between the marginal social benef ts in fulf lling the legislative purpose and the marginal social harm caused to the constitutional right. As for principled balancing, such balancing is conducted – but only during the process of creating a new category or amending an existing one. T is balancing, however, is no longer conducted once the category has been established. T ere is no more balancing. T is is even more so in the case of minimal scrutiny. All that is required by this level of review is that the legislative means have a rational basis. T is basis does not require a balancing between the benef t and the harm. It is similar, in many ways, to the sub-test of proportionality – that of rational connection. 68 T at test, too, is not based on the act of balancing. 69

T e intermediate level of scrutiny demands a substantial relation between the purpose and the means. T is requirement is not based on a balancing between the benef ts gained by fulf lling the purpose and the harm to the constitutional right. T is test, to some degree, is similar to proportionality's rational connection test, although it demands a higher level of connection.

 Finally, at the strict scrutiny level, the legislative means must be narrowly tailored, or "necessary" in order to achieve the "compelling" legislative purpose at hand. T ere are signif cant similarities between the

phrasing of this requirement and that of proportionality's test of necessity. 70 T is requirement, as well, is not based on any act of balancing between the benef ts gained by the public interest and the harm caused to the individual right. 71 T is category is based on a principled-interpretive balancing which determined the category's boundaries. Once the category's boundaries have been set, no additional balancing should be conducted within the category's boundaries.

# ii. Protecting human rights: categorization versus proportionality

**a. Te potential for protection and its realization** Proportionality and categorization – which of the two provides human rights with the greater level of protection? 72 T e answer to this question can be given at two levels. T e f rst is the theoretical-methodological level. 73 T is level examines the theoretical potential within each of the two models in relation to the level of protection they provide to constitutional human rights (through legislation or case law). T is level of protection will determine, in turn, the boundaries of governmental discretion when a constitutional right is limited. 74T e second level is the empirical level. 75 T is level examines the actual manner in which the theoretical underpinnings were utilized in a given legal system. Most of the examination is dedicated to the f rst level, but a few comments regarding the second level will be made as well.

 **b. Te scope of a constitutional right** T e scope of the constitutional right – to dif erentiate from its realization at the sub-constitutional level 76 – is determined through interpretation of the constitutional text. T is is well known to legal systems that have adopted proportionality, as well as to the American legal system which has adopted categorization. On a theoretical level, there is no reason for the scope of any given right to dif er from one system to another. T us, for example, from a principled-theoretical standpoint there is no reason to assume that the scope of the right to freedom of expression in Canada, South Africa, Israel,

or according to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights 77 would be dif erent from the scope of the right as determined by the First Amendment to the US Constitution. But, in practice, the scope is dif erent. 78 Several types of speech have been excluded from the right as interpreted by the American system, while they are still regarded as part of the right by those legal systems that adopted proportionality. T us, for example, hate speech, 79 obscenity, 80 incitement to illegal action, 81 and intentional (or reckless) defamation of a public f gure, 82 are excluded from the scope of the right to freedom of speech as the First Amendment is interpreted. In contrast, all of these do make up a part of the rights in those legal systems that have adopted proportionality.

 An interesting question is whether this narrowing of the right's scope is connected to the method of legal categorization which characterizes American law. T e answer to this questions tends to be positive. T e categorization approach, as part of the principled-interpretive balance it conducts, seeks to provide every right with a clear and well-def ned scope such that it would not conf ict with other constitutional rights. Each category is independent. T ere is no room, within a given category, to conduct a specif c (or ad hoc ) balancing. T is approach – which reduces the possibility of a conf ict between two (or more) constitutional rights – leads to an interpretive result that leaves some aspects of the right's penumbra outside its recognized scope.

**c. Limitations on realizing the right's scope** Legal systems do not consider all constitutional rights as absolutes. T e rules of proportionality, and, in the United States, the dif erent levels of scrutiny, limit the realization of the right to its fullest scope. How do the two methods compare in this realm?

 It seems that all would agree that the minimal level of scrutiny, adopted by American law regarding a number of rights, enables the imposition of more substantial limitations on those rights in this category than would be permitted under proportionality. At this level of scrutiny, it is suf cient that the purpose is a legitimate government interest and that the means selected to achieve that interest have a rational basis. 83 T e proper purpose requirement matches that required by German constitutional law, 84 albeit, it is a narrower demand than required by other legal systems which practice proportionality. 85 Regarding the means, the American requirement seems to be quite similar to proportionality's rational connection test. 86 Proportionality, on the other hand, is not satisf ed with this. Rather, proportionality requires that the means be necessary (that no less restrictive alternative exists), 87 and that a proper relation exists between the marginal social benef ts in fulf lling the law's purposes and the marginal social harm it would cause to the right in question. 88 T ese two requirements, which are part and parcel of proportionality, are not required in the minimal scrutiny test. T us, the rights included in this category – such as the limitation of equality (not including suspect and quasi-suspect classif cations), and the right to travel outside the country – receive less protection by American law than that of ered by those countries that have adopted proportionality. 89

 A similar conclusion is reached regarding intermediate scrutiny. Here, too, the level of protection of ered by American law is narrower than that of ered by countries that have adopted proportionality. T is category entails, inter alia , protection of the right to equality (when the classif cations are based on gender or age), the right to commercial speech, and freedom of speech in a public forum. T is category requires that the legislation's purpose be an important governmental interest and that the means selected should bear a substantial relation to fulf lling the purpose.

<sup>83</sup> See R. C. Farrell, "Successful Rational Basis Claims in the Supreme Court from the 1971 Term through Romer v. Evans," 32 Ind. L. Rev . 357 ( 1999 ). 84 See below, at 529. 85 See above, at 289. 86 See above, at 303. 87 See above, at 317. 88 See above, at 350. 89 See Stone Sweet and Mathews, above note 44, at 45 ("[R]ational basis review leads

American judge to abdicate their duty to protect rights.").

T e American requirement regarding the important governmental purpose is stricter than the requirement in German law, which is satisf ed with a legislative purpose that does not contradict the constitution. 90T en again, the American requirement falls short of the requirements posed by other countries that have adopted proportionality. 91 T e main dif culty, however, concerns the means. T e American substantial relation requirement falls short of proportionality's necessity test. 92 Most importantly, the American test does not demand a proper relation between the marginal social benef t gained by the limiting legislation and the marginal social harm caused to the right in question. It has no balancing. From a holistic point of view it seems to provide less protection to the rights included within it than that of ered by those legal systems that have adopted proportionality.

 **d. Te issue with regard to strict scrutiny** T e most complicated comparison is that between the level of protection of ered to the rights included within the f rst tier of protection – strict scrutiny – and that of ered by proportionality. T e dif culty is two-fold. First, it stems from the lack of clarity regarding the conditions of the strict scrutiny review; and, second, from the dif culty in comparing the actual fulf llment of the dif erent requirements which have arisen in the case law. T e f rst diff culty is theoretical; the second is pragmatic. Due to the sheer amount of American case law and literature on the subject, the dif culties are evident.

T e discussion begins with the theoretical comparison. Strict scrutiny requires, in terms of the legislation's proper purpose, that the limiting legislation be a compelling state interest, or that its fulf llment be a pressing public necessity or a substantial state interest. T is is a very high level requirement. Only some of the countries that have adopted proportionality have a similar requirement. In Canada, for example, a similar requirement exists which demands that the legislation's purpose must fulf ll a pressing public necessity or a substantial state interest. 93 However there is a dif erence between this requirement in Canadian and American law, this dif erence is concerns the "seriousness" with which the requirement is actually applied. While American courts have taken the proper purpose

- 91 See above, at 289.
- 92 See above, at 317.
- 93 See above, at 279.

requirement extremely seriously, in Canada, conversely, its application depends on the circumstances of the case. A plausible explanation is that in the United States this requirement appears only with regard to strict scrutiny (that is, with regard to only a few of the rights protected by the Constitution), whereas in Canada the same requirement applies to all constitutional rights.

 More dif cult still is the comparison of the means used by the legislator. American law requires, with regard to the strict scrutiny review, that the means be narrowly tailored, or necessary to fulf ll the legislation's purpose. 94 T is condition, again, is two-fold: f rst, that there is no other means that are less restrictive; 95 and, second, that those means are not overbroad. 96 Comparing these requirements and proportionality's tests reveals that the f rst requirement regarding no other means being less restrictive, is quite similar to the necessity requirement imposed by proportionality's test. 97 T e dif erence with regard to the necessity test focuses on the requirement regarding overbreadth. 98 Both proportionality and strict scrutiny would agree that, if there is overbreadth, then part of the limitation of the constitutional right is not necessary to fulf ll the legislative purpose. In this case, the means are unconstitutional according to strict scrutiny and proportionality.

 What should happen when it is not possible to separate the overbreadth and the necessary breadth? 99 What about when the overbreadth is inherent to the subject in such a manner that the law's purposes cannot be fulf lled without overbreadth. An example is the Israeli Supreme Court case of Adalah . 100 T ere, in order to prevent the aiding and abetting of terrorist activity aimed at Israel, the Israeli government imposed a complete ban on family unif cation with spouses residing in the Occupied Territories. T is restriction also applied, naturally, to spouses who had never aided or abetted any terrorists and who – according to the best

available intelligence – were not likely to do so in the future. T is is, by any measure, "overbroad" coverage. To prevent it, an individual examination was necessary. It was demonstrated to the Court that within the individual examination it was impossible to identify which spouses had the "potential" to aid and abet. In this type of situation, overbreadth is virtually inevitable.

 How do the two methods solve this situation? According to proportionality, all the requirements of the second (necessity) test have been met, and therefore, despite its overbreadth, the measure would continue on the course of constitutional review and would now have to satisfy the requirements of proportionality stricto sensu . In some cases, therefore, the legislation would be held constitutional – if a proper relation exists between the marginal social benef ts gained by the legislation and the marginal social harm caused to the right in question. In other cases, however, the law would be declared unconstitutional. In any event, such a determination would be made in accordance with the requirements of the proportionality stricto sensu test.

 What is the American approach to the issue? T e answer is not free from doubt. 101 If under American law the necessity requirements are met – when the overbroad portion cannot be separated from the rest of the means – then the legislation passes constitutional muster and there is no need to continue the process of judicial review. T is is not the case with proportionality: here, satisfying the necessity test is but one of the requirements to pass constitutional muster. 102 According to proportionality, af er passing the necessity test, the test of proportionality stricto sensu still remains, this test demands a balance between the marginal social benef ts in fulf lling the law's purposes and the marginal social harm to the constitutional right. T en the conclusion – based on the assumption that, with inseparable overbreadth, the necessity requirement of the strict review is fulf lled – is that the protection of constitutional right according to proportionality is stronger. Legislation deemed constitutional in American law af er the necessity test must still pass another review (proportionality stricto sensu ) according to proportionality, and may still be found unconstitutional. As such, the right in question is guaranteed better protection.

T e result according to American law is dif erent when the necessity requirement is not fulf lled in the case of overbreadth which cannot be

- 101 See Fallon, above note 60, at 1328.
- 102 See above, at 340.

separated. According to this assumption, the legislation is not constitutional as it has not passed the necessity test and therefore there is no room for additional examinations. T is is not the case according to proportionality. According to proportionality, the necessity requirement is fulf lled and the legislation's fate is once again decided by proportionality stricto sensu . T e conclusion is as follows: assuming the overbreadth which cannot be separated does not satisfy the necessity requirement according to strict scrutiny, the protection of the constitutional right according to this level of scrutiny is stronger in American law than according to proportionality. Legislation which, af er the necessity test, has been found unconstitutional in American law must still pass the proportionality stricto sensu test, af er which it may be found constitutional.

 Take, for example, the case of Korematsu . 103 T ere the court reviewed the constitutionality of an executive order, issued during the Second World War, which forbade all American citizens of Japanese descent from remaining in certain areas, as determined in the order, which included the west coast of the United States. T e reason the order was issued was military necessity stemming from the concern that American-Japanese were more likely to co-operate with Japan – with whom the US was at war. No individual examination was conducted. T e petitioner violated the order; he was indicted and convicted, and he appealed to the US Supreme Court. All nine Justices agreed that the order was "suspect," as the classif cation was based upon race and that strict scrutiny of the order was needed. Most of the Justices (six) accepted the government's argument that this order was necessary at a time of war and therefore that the conviction should be af rmed. T e dissent was of the opinion that the order was unconstitutional. Today, it is widely accepted that the majority opinion was incorrect. T e reason behind this is the striking lack of evidence supporting the military necessity argument presented by the government at the time of the trial. 104

 Let us assume, then, for argument's sake, a hypothetical situation where military necessity was proved to the court. Let us further assume that it was shown that every ff h American of a certain descent is actively conspiring to co-operate with the enemy. Assume that it has been proven that there is no way to identify those citizens suspected of collaborating and that there is no other means to prevent the danger they represent save

for a blanket restriction on the entire group. Under those circumstances, would such an executive order pass constitutional muster? A review of the American literature on the subject does not yield a clear answer.

 Fallon has thoroughly reviewed the concept of strict scrutiny. In particular, Fallon examined the question discussed earlier relating to overbreadth which cannot be narrowly tailored to achieve the compelling government interest at issue. Fallon, too, noted that no clear approach could be found in American case law to this question. However, Fallon raised the possibility that in those circumstances the legislation would not be declared unconstitutional, but rather the proportionality of its limitation would be examined. As he wrote:

> It is imaginable, if only barely, that even the smallest element of underinclusiveness or overinclusiveness could condemn a statute subject to strict scrutiny. But if any underinclusiveness, and perhaps especially any overinclusiveness, is permissible, the question inevitably arises: How much under- or overinclusiveness is tolerable, and how much is too much?

> Although the Supreme Court has seldom if ever said so expressly, the need to answer this question would appear to require an inquiry analogous to those that other countries' courts conduct in assessing "proportionality" – a term that I invoke here to emphasize similarity, not to claim identity. In determining whether a particular degree of statutory under- or overinclusiveness is tolerable, a court must judge whether the damage or wrong attending an infringement on protected rights is constitutionally acceptable in light of the government's compelling aims, the probability that the challenged policy will achieve them, and available alternative means of pursuing the same goals. 105

 If Fallon's approach were to be adopted by the American Supreme Court, it would be possible to say that the level of protection granted to human rights by the American strict scrutiny level of review is similar, in theory at least, to the one of ered by those countries that have adopted proportionality. 106 But what if Fallon is wrong? What if, under this set of circumstances, the limiting legislation would uphold the requirements of the strict scrutiny review without any review of its proportionality? If that were the solution, then the level of protection of ered by proportionality is greater than that of ered by the American strict scrutiny.

 So far the comparison between proportionality and strict scrutiny has been solely theoretical. T is comparison lacks a practical aspect. According to the conventional wisdom in the United States, once a

<sup>105</sup> See Fallon, above note 60, at 1330. 106 See Stone Sweet and Mathews, above note 44.

legislative provision is categorized as falling into the purview of strict scrutiny, it is most likely destined to fail the constitutional review. It is in that context that Gunther commented that "strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact." 107 T is is not always the case according to the tests of proportionality.

### iii. Categorization and criticism of proportionality

**a. Categorization and the internal critique of balancing** At the foundation of proportionality's criticism is the critique of proportionality stricto sensu . T is test anchors the balancing between the marginal social benef ts gained by the limiting legislation and the marginal social harm caused by it to the constitutional right. 108 T is criticism can be divided into internal and external criticism. T e internal criticism, which opens this discussion, focuses on the issue of incommensurability and its lack of a rational basis, 109 and continues on to the claim that it stems from intuition and improvisation and subjective judging. 110 Could the same arguments be made against categorization? Categorization is not based upon specif c ( ad hoc ) balancing; therefore, the internal critique, assuming it is aimed at that act of balancing, is not relevant to categorization. However, categorization is based upon principled balancing. 111 Such balancing is of an interpretive nature (interpretive balancing). 112 It determines the scope of the category. Accordingly, any criticism of this type of balancing within proportionality may well be aimed at that same type within the categorization. T us, for example, it is possible to argue that categorization's view, according to which the right to free speech does not include obscenities or incitement to commit illegal acts, is merely the result of an interpretive-principled act of balancing between the principle of free speech and other competing principles. T us, if a specif c balancing is not plausible, neither is principled balancing, which gives the principle of free speech very little, if any, weight. Similarly, the claims regarding a lack of rationality and the subjective judiciary can also be raised against

<sup>107</sup> See G. Gunther, "T e Supreme Court, 1971 Term – Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing Court: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection," 86 Harv. L. Rev . 1, 8 ( 1972 ). Not everyone agrees with this description: see S. E. Gottlieb, "Compelling Governmental Interests: An Essential But Unanalyzed Term in Constitutional Adjudication," 68 Boston University L. Rev . 917 ( 1988 ). See also Winkler, above note 60. 108 See above, at 350. 109 See above, at 482. 110 See above, at 512. 111 See Stone Sweet and Mathews, above note 44.

<sup>112</sup> On interpretive balancing, see below, at 522.

the principled-interpretive balancing at categorization's foundation. T e answers provided within proportionality to those arguments also apply to categorization. However, the criticism applies more vigorously to proportionality than to categorization, since for proportionality this criticism applies – to a dif erent degree – in every single case, whereas for categorization the criticism applies only to the creation of the category (or to the modif cation of its scope).

### **b. Categorization and the external critique on balancing**

aa. Too wide a judicial discretion One of the arguments against proportionality is that it provides judges with too wide a discretion.113 Is categorization spared this criticism? T e answer, in principle, is no. If the criticism against proportionality is aimed at determining the proper legislative purpose by the judge, the same arguments may be raised against determining the compelling state interest or similar notions within the contours of categorization. T e same is true for judicial discretion regarding the rational connection test and the necessity test; both of these apply to categorization, mostly at the same intensity.

 But what about judicial discretion as it applies to balancing? Categorization entails no specif c balancing act, but it does include a principled-interpretive balancing that determines the limits of the category. Is the judicial discretion available during the concrete balancing wider than that available during the principled-interpretive balancing? From the standpoint of the trial judge, the answer is yes. In those systems where categorization applies, the category is provided to the trial court as a given, a f nished product that cannot be reevaluated. T us, the trial judge has no discretion as to the principled-interpretive type of balancing; obviously, the judge has no discretion as to specif c balancing either, since this type of balancing does not exist within categorization. T is is not the case according to proportionality. Here, the trial judge may exercise discretion while conducting a specif c balance. T us, the discretion exercised at the trial level is narrower with categorization than it is with proportionality.

 Does the same conclusion apply to the highest court in the system? Is the discretion used by the highest court for balancing within categorization narrower than that used within proportionality? T is question has no simple answer. T e proposition that the highest court may exercise

113 See above, at 487.

some discretion as to balancing is acceptable. 114 However, this discretion is of a limited nature. It is limited by past precedents; it is limited by judicial tradition; and it is limited by the values upon which that legal system is based. Is this discretion wider than that exercised by the American Supreme Court justices with regard to categorization? American Supreme Court justices, who are allowed to overturn their own precedents, can use judicial discretion whenever they approach the creation of a new category or the setting of new contours in an existing category. 115 Such discretion is based on the conduct of a principled-interpretive balance. In several notable cases, the American Supreme Court was asked to change the structure of existing constitutional categories. T us, for example, much of the feminist movement for equal rights was focused on " upgrading " the level of scrutiny relating to gender-based classif cations from intermediate to strict. T e same is true for age-based classif cation. T ese struggles over the proper place in the hierarchy of constitutional scrutiny of en mirror the social struggles in the United States. It is very dif cult to evaluate the scope of the discretion provided to American justices in comparison to the discretion granted to other supreme and constitutional court judges in applying proportionality stricto sensu . It is dif cult, for example, to evaluate the loyalty demonstrated by the American Supreme Court to past precedents in comparison with the loyalty to precedents demonstrated by judges of proportionality courts. I doubt that these can be quantif ed. It seems we are lef with nothing more than mere speculations.

 bb. Lack of suf cient protection on human rights Another criticism of proportionality argues that the balance that underlies it weakens the protection granted to human rights. According to this argument, the protection granted to constitutional rights by the American categorization approach – in particular, the protection provided by the strict scrutiny review – provides greater protection than that of ered by proportionality. T is argument, however, is far from describing the normative reality. T e picture is much more complex and does not allow for an unequivocal answer. A precise reply requires an examination of each and every right – both on the theoretical level, as well as on the practical level. 116

 It has been argued that categorization may provide human rights with better protection than proportionality particularly during national emergencies. T e reason for this is that, during times of national emergency, judges tend to ascribe more weight to arguments favoring national security as opposed to those favoring individual rights. In contrast, the argument goes on, thinking in categories is immune to these considerations. Both parts of this argument are far from being factually sustainable. 117 T us, for example, the Israeli Supreme Court has provided ample protection to constitutional rights during periods of extremely trying national emergency, all while using proportionality stricto sensu (balancing). 118 T e same is true for the English House of Lords. 119 In contrast, American courts, despite the use of dif erent categories, found this protection troublesome at times of national emergency, 120 although, at the end of

the day, the movement has been positive towards human rights. 121 T e war on terror – one of the judicial hallmarks of the late twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-f rst century – does not point to any principled advantage gained by the use of categorization over proportionality in terms of human rights protection. In fact, the opposite seems to be true. Proportionality has demonstrated its ability to protect human rights particularly in the dark hours of the war on terror.

cc. Denying judicial legitimacy T e argument is that the act of balancing, which is at the core of proportionality, is one of the main characteristics of legislation and therefore should not be performed by judges. 122 Categorization, the argument continues, is more typical of judging as it is devoid of the feature of specif c balancing. It seems, once again, that both parts of the argument are not substantiated. Balancing is typical of both legislating and judging. T e common law is based on the balancing between competing principles, and its entire being is based on judging. T inking in categories, on the other hand, is of en used by legislators as well. T us, both balancing and categorization may well be considered an integral part of the tasks performed by each of the two branches – the judicial and the legislative. 123

 It is interesting to note that the legitimacy of judicial review is most of en under attack in the United States, which applies categorization. 124 T is is not the case in most legal systems that have adopted proportionality, including the balancing at its foundation. 125 In fact, in these countries, the use of judicial review seems to be spreading. 126 Countries that

were unwilling to adopt the institution of judicial review in the past are now changing their constitution in order to allow it. T at was the case, for example, with most countries of the former Soviet Union. 127 T e same is true in France, which in 2008 adopted full judicial review of the constitutionality of legislation not only prior to its publication ( " preview " ) but also af er being published ( " review " ). 128 It seems that there is a growing trend according to which the notion of a constitutional democracy entails both a written constitution and an acknowledgment of the institution of judicial review. T is development may be explained in two ways. First, the US Constitution contains no explicit provision relating to judicial review of a law ' s constitutionality. T e adoption of judicial review there was done through the courts. 129T is is not the case for those constitutions that have adopted proportionality. In those constitutions, a specif c provision relating to judicial review is an integral part of the constitutional text. Second, despite its formal provisions on the matter, the US Constitution is, in practice, very dif cult to amend. T is, again, is not the case with many of the proportionality-related constitutions. T ese may be relatively easily amended in comparison to their American counterpart. Both of those explanations are not directly related to thinking in categories or to the conduct of balancing.

### iv. Categorization as an alternative to proportionality?

 While proportionality may not be able to provide fully convincing replies to all of its criticisms, the same conclusion may apply to categorization as well. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. 130 Each method has developed as part of a very distinct set of historical and social circumstances. It can be assumed that the two methods will draw closer in

the future. 131 Indeed, the f rst signs of this trend may already be emerging, as some American courts have begun adopting some aspects of proportionality. 132 Still, it seems that it is too early to properly evaluate this trend. It might be the case, as Schauer argues, that proportionality courts will adopt some aspects of the American system. 133 Indeed, both proportionality and categorization are a part of the legal architecture.134 Each ref ects the society in which it was developed, and each is shaped and inf uenced by extrinsic legal developments. It is therefore hard to assess what the future holds for each. In any event, every legal system must strive to improve and further develop the methods it uses. Some of the ways to do just that will now be examined.

# T e future of proportionality

# **A. Regarding the need forrenewal**

 Proportionality is not perfect; yet none of the suggested alternatives – with categorization as the central one – ensures a more appropriate arrangement. We should therefore focus on proportionality and ways to improve it. Indeed, by now it has been several decades since proportionality was f rst introduced to the Western legal systems. During this period, no signif cant changes have occurred in its components or its understanding as a constitutional tool. It seems that the time is ripe, therefore, for a reexamination. It is in this context that the subjects which require a reconsideration are raised, in order to refresh and develop the doctrine of proportionality.

 When considering improvements to proportionality, it is important to make use of the legal and judicial experience provided by comparative law. Obviously, of particular interest are those legal systems that have adopted proportionality; it is appropriate that they learn from each other's perspective, but this is insuf cient. T e American academic literature and case law are of particular interest. T e dif erence between proportionality and the American system of categorization in relation to the protection of human rights can be reduced to the issue of specif c ( ad hoc ) balancing, or proportionality stricto sensu . 1 Other than in this component, however, the two methods are in fact quite similar. T at is also the main reason for the two methods drawing closer in recent decades, at least with respect to the portions in which they are similar. 2

 In this f nal chapter, each of proportionality's components will be examined. T e main subjects which require further development in each

See generally, V. Jackson, Constitutional Engagement in a Transnational Era (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010 ), 60.

of these components will be discussed. T e discussion begins with the proper purpose, that is, the purpose justifying a limitation on a constitutional right. T is requirement is common to all legal systems, and therefore development in this area may be of particular interest. T e chapter then turns to a review of the components of rational connection and necessity and examines whether these components can bear a "heavier burden" of value-laden content and therefore "relieve the burden" from proportionality stricto sensu . Finally, the dif erent aspects in the development of the consideration regarding that last component – proportionality stricto sensu will be examined.

# **B. Te proper purpose component – future developments**

### 1. Dif erent approaches to proper purpose

### i. T e spectrum of approaches

 A review of comparative law reveals several approaches to the proper purpose component. T e focus herein is on those instances where the proper purpose relates to the public interest. Instances where the proper purpose constitutes an individual right will be dealt with separately. 3 Regarding those cases where on one side of the scales we have a constitutionally protected right limited by law and on the other we have a public interest whose fulf llment led to the limitation, we can dif erentiate between several principled approaches. On one end of the spectrum is German constitutional law, according to which, in the absence of a specif c constitutional provision on this matter, the only thing the proper purpose needs to satisfy is the fairly undemanding requirement of not running contrary to the constitution. 4 On the other end of the spectrum is the approach adopted by the Canadian Supreme Court in Oakes , according to which in order to satisfy the requirement that the purpose be "suf ciently important" it must "relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society." 5

 Between these two ends of the spectrum are the approaches that have been adopted in dif erent countries. For example, in South Africa opinions are divided on this matter. Some are of the opinion that the Canadian

<sup>3</sup> See below, at 533.

<sup>4</sup> See D. Grimm, "Proportionality in Canadian and German Constitutional Jurisprudence," 57 U. Toronto L. J . 383, 388 ( 2007 ). 5

R. v. Oakes [1986] 1 SCR 103, § 69.

Oakes test 6 should be adopted, while others are satisf ed suggesting a "compelling purpose," or one that carries "substantial" weight. 7 In Israel, it has been stated that a purpose is proper only if it corresponds with the values of the State of Israel and if it shows particular sensitivity to the role of human rights in the Israeli legal system. 8 American law distinguishes between three categories of rights. 9 In the f rst category, which includes the most fundamental rights, the legislative purpose must serve a compelling state interest (or a pressing public necessity, or a substantial state interest). In the second category (the middle one), which includes the "intermediate" rights, the court requires that the legislative purpose in question serve "an important" governmental interest. Finally, in the third category (the lowest one), the rest of the constitutional rights are included. To limit the rights in this category all that is required is that the legislation be legitimate.

### ii. A threshold requirement based on a justif cation

T e key similarity between all these approaches is that the requirement for a proper purpose is a threshold requirement. 10 T ere is no ad hoc balancing. T e scope of the limitation on the constitutional right in question is not at issue while determining the "appropriateness" of the law's purpose. T is is the proper approach. It ref ects the proper relation between the constitutional right and the public interest. T is relation means that the very existence of a public interest, in and of itself, would not suf ce in justifying a limitation on a constitutional right. T e public interest must be of a special character in order to examine the nature of the limitation and decide whether it is constitutional. In that sense, all legal systems have accepted the approach that rights are shields used by individuals to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority. 11

 A key question is where should such a threshold requirement be located. In some cases, the solution may be found in the constitution itself. It may specify those instances in which the public interest may

justify imposing a limitation on a protected right. T us, for example, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms 12 explicitly states that the right to freedom of expression may be limited in order to protect national security interests. 13 Such a provision, however, only begins the inquiry; it does not direct us in understanding what level of national security threat would justify the limitation on the freedom of expression. Similarly, in the same provision it provides that the right to freedom of expression may only be limited by provisions that are "prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society." 14 Can that provision direct the interpreter as to the importance of the limiting purpose as a threshold requirement, or does it relate to other components of proportionality, once the threshold requirement has been satisf ed?

 We are, then, back to square one: what is the proper threshold level to be satisf ed to justify the imposition of a limitation of a constitutional right? Further, should this level be uniform, as suggested by the Canadian Supreme Court in Oakes ? Or should the level instead vary in accordance with the social importance of the right, as the American Supreme Court has held? If we opt for a uniform level, then what should that level be? If the levels vary, then what are those dif erent levels?

### 2. T e proper approach: the hierarchy of constitutional rights with regard to the purpose's importance

- i. A hierarchy of rights based on historical experience
 It appears that the best approach is to establish a hierarchy of rights in relation to the legislative purpose in question. Moreover, that hierarchy should include only two levels of constitutional rights. T e f rst level would consist of all the "fundamental" or "high-level" rights; the other level would consist of all the other rights.

 As an initial matter, the approach that all constitutional rights are equal in importance in relation to the requirement of proper purpose, and that therefore a uniform approach should be established for the requirement, cannot be accepted. T e main concern is that, should such a uniform approach be adopted, the threshold level required would be far too low for all the protected rights. Such is the case, for example, in Germany, where

<sup>12</sup> European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (1950). 13 Ibid ., Art. 10(2). 14 Ibid .

the only requirement for the law's purpose to satisfy is that it would not be in conf ict with the constitution. Such an easy-to-satisfy requirement is not suf cient to justify the placing of a limitation on a constitutionally protected human right, as it does not acknowledge the special role constitutional rights have within the system of a constitutional democracy. Having said that, however, the issue of a too-low uniform requirement may be resolved through the adoption of a much more demanding standard. T at was the solution, for example, adopted by the Canadian Supreme Court in Oakes . But experience has shown that the courts found it nearly impossible to apply such a high threshold requirement. In fact, over the years the courts have gradually reduced this high threshold level, turning it, in practice, into an even lower requirement. More importantly, not all rights are created equal; not all rights are equal in their social value. 15 True, all constitutional rights are of equal constitutional status; but the same constitutional status does not render them of the same social value. T us, my position on the need for two levels of constitutional rights rests on both a practical and a theoretical (or normative) reasoning.

 What is the nature of those separate levels of constitutional rights? In this context, it is recommended that each legal system adopt its own solution; each country should determine for itself which rights are "fundamental" to its own democracy and which rights are not. It is not logic, but rather historical experience, that should be the decisive factor here. According to the historical experience of both the United States 16 and South Africa, 17 it would be only natural to consider equality – and in particular equality on the basis of race – as a right of the highest order. Similarly, based on Europe's historical account, it would only be natural to consider the right to human dignity as a right of the highest order in post-Second World War Germany. 18 It seems to me that Israel ascribes the highest level of importance to human dignity as its people were victims of the violation of human dignity in the Second World War.

### ii. T e importance of the purpose requirement as derived from the hierarchy of rights

 Once a hierarchy of rights has been determined, it is time to set the threshold level of the purpose's importance. T e American legal system may be of guidance in this matter. It seems that the f rst two levels of scrutiny are

<sup>15</sup> See above, at 359. 16 US Const., Am. XIV. 17 Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, Arts. 1, 7, 36.

<sup>18</sup> Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Art. 1.

proper, whereas the third (the minimal one) is not. Regarding the constitutional rights of the highest level, it is appropriate to adopt an arrangement similar to the "strict scrutiny" used in American law. It should be required that the law's purpose be either "compelling" or "pressing." T is would properly express the high degree of social importance placed by these systems on those fundamental rights. In addition, in order to succeed, as the Canadian experience has taught us, such a requirement should be reserved for a relatively small number of rights that are considered by that society to be of the highest order.

T e rest of the rights should be grouped into the second level. Here, the requirement should be that the law's purpose be "important." T is is the requirement posed by the American "intermediate scrutiny" level. Such a demand balances the need not to require too high a threshold while, at the same time, according the proper weight to those rights in a constitutional democracy. Indeed, a lower requirement – such as the "legitimate purpose" requirement posed by the minimal level of scrutiny in the United States would represent too low a threshold for limiting rights in a constitutional democracy.

### 3. Proper purpose and protection of constitutional rights

### i. T e conventional wisdom

 When two constitutional rights conf ict (such as the right to privacy with that of freedom of expression), the solution is found at the sub-constitutional level (a statute or common law). 19 T us, proportionality operates at the sub-constitutional level. It applies in any case where a constitutional right has been limited. As for the reason behind the limitation on the right in question (such as the freedom of expression), there is usually no distinction between a case where the limitation was caused by the fulf llment of the public interest (such as national security interests) and that of a limitation caused by the need to advance another person's right (such as the right to privacy of another person): 20 in both cases, the law's purpose must be proper; a rational connection must exist between the means selected to fulf ll the law's purpose and the purpose; that no alternative means exist which equally fulf ll the law's purposes while being less restrictive to the right; and that there is a proportional relation between the marginal

<sup>19</sup> See above, at 89.

<sup>20</sup> See R. Alexy, "Individual Rights and Collective Goods," in C. Nino (eds.), Rights (New York University Press, 1992 ), 163.

social benef ts gained by fulf lling the law's purposes and the marginal social harm caused by limiting the right in question.

T is approach stems from the fundamental understanding that proportionality applies whenever a constitutional right (such as the freedom of expression) conf icts with an opposing principle, and it is irrelevant whether said opposing principle was meant to serve the public interest (as in national security considerations) or the right of another person (as in the right to privacy). Contributing to this notion is the understanding that the distinction between the public interest and other people's rights are blurred. T us, some of the issues that were once perceived as part of the public interest (such as education, medical services, and the environment) are now understood as individual rights. 21 Moreover, of en a limitation on one person's right is intended to fulf ll a person's right which in terms of its magnitude and inf uence is similar to those of the state itself, to the extent that it would be justif ed to view such rights as part of the public interest rather than as an individual right. Finally, in many cases, considerations of the public interest and individual rights are conf ated to a point that it is hard to see where one begins and the other ends. In light of all of these developments, the current prevailing approach – according to which a limitation on a constitutional right should be treated in the same manner whether it protects another constitutional right or furthers the public interest – is both justif ed and appropriate. However, although this approach is clear and proper, it is time to ref ne it in several respects, so that the special importance of the constitutional right protected will be ref ected in the justif cation of the limitation of another constitutional right.

### ii. Disadvantages of the conventional wisdom

 Most constitutional rights are shaped as principles. According to Alexy, a principle strives for optimization subject to factual and legal possibilities. Is the opposing public-interest consideration (such as national security considerations or public order) also a principle seeking optimization? Alexy's answer is positive, 22 but it is doubtful that this is indeed the case. Rivers correctly noted, when referring to public interest considerations, that:

> [T]hey cannot be optimisation requirements in the same sense as rights, since legislatures are under no obligation to optimise them or even pursue

- 21 See above, at 254.
- 22 See Alexy, above note 20.

that at all. One could accept that they are unenforceable optimisation requirements on account of a lack of a relevant cause of action. But even under constitutional systems which permit legal actions to ensure the general constitutionality of a measure, courts never consider whether legislatures have pursued the public interest to the greatest possible extent. T us, public interests have to be construed as optimisation permissions, and principles must be redef ned as optimisation requirements or permissions. Only rights correlate to optimisation requirements in the strict sense. 23

 Indeed, we cannot properly compare protection of the public interest (such as national security) as a justif cation for placing a limitation on a human right (such as freedom of expression), and the case of protecting another constitutional right (such as the right to privacy) as a justif cation for the same limitation. Take, for example, legislation limiting a public interest (such as the level of national security) in order to elevate – that is, to better protect – the normative level of a constitutional right (such as the freedom of expression). Should the limitation on the public interest satisfy all the requirements of proportionality? Would the limiting law be declared unconstitutional merely because the (elevated) level of protection granted to the right in question by the limiting law may be obtained through the use of a means that would be less restrictive to the public interest in question? Would the balancing test of proportionality stricto sensu apply in the same way to this kind of limitation – that is, a limitation on the public interest in order to protect a constitutional right? Should we not say that, when we have constitutional rights on both sides of the scales, then the requirements of proportionality should address both, while, when on one end of the scales we have a constitutional right and on the other a consideration of the public interest, then proportionality would only apply to a limitation on a constitutional right? 24

 It is believed that we should distinguish between two situations. One way of reasoning such a distinction would be to follow the Dworkinian approach which distinguishes between principles and policies. 25 While Dworkin adamantly opposed letting a judge balance between limitations on a constitutional right and fulf lling social policies, he never opposed

<sup>23</sup> J. Rivers, "Proportionality, Discretion and the Second Law of Balancing," in G. Pavlakos (ed.), Law, Rights, and Discourse: T e Legal Philosophy of Robert Alexy (Portland, OR:

Hart Publishing, 2007), 167, 168. 24 See D. Meyerson, "Why Courts Should Not Balance Rights against the Public Interest,"

<sup>31</sup> Melb. U. L. Rev . 873 ( 2007 ). 25 See R. Dworkin, Taking Rights Seriously (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1977), 22.

granting a judge the authority to balance between two competing constitutional rights. Rawls, too, has recognized the need to allow a judge to balance between two conf icting constitutional rights. Obviously, this does not mean we must go the distance with either Dworkin or Rawls; rather, we can adopt the distinction while applying it in a more reserved fashion. Another justif cation may be that supplied by Rivers, 26 who argues that the legislator is under no obligation to seek the optimization of the public interest, while it does have a constitutional obligation to seek an optimization for constitutional rights. T is obligation ref ects the "positive" aspect of constitutional rights, which mostly deals with the level of protection granted to those rights rather than with preventing the imposition of limitations on them. 27 T e prevailing notion 28 is that the legislative duties are not exhausted by merely complying with the negative aspect of those rights. Rather, the legislator must also satisfy the "positive" duties relating to those same rights. Against this background, it should be clear why the status of a constitutional right – which requires the legislator to abide by both positive and negative duties – is quite dif erent to that of a public interest consideration, which does not require the same of the legislator. It may also be the case that the justif cation for the distinction between the high level of protection granted to individual rights and the lower level of protection granted to the public interest relates to the scope of legislative discretion applied to each. T us, for example, the scope of the discretion that the legislator may exercise in relation to his duties with respect to the constitutional right is much narrower than the discretion it may use with regard to the advancement of the public interest. And, while all those differences do not af ect the need to apply proportionality to both sides of the scales whenever two constitutional rights are weighed against each other, they may well af ect a more subtle application of the requirements of proportionality in those cases where against the constitutional right stands a consideration of the public interest.

### iii. Proper purpose: protection of a constitutional right as a justif cation for the limitation of a constitutional right

 Proportionality requires that the limiting law be enacted for a proper purpose. 29 T is requirement is an expression of the understanding that

- 26 See Rivers, above note 23.
- 
- 27 Ibid ., at 168. 28 See above, at 422.
- 29 See above, at 245.

a limitation on a constitutional right may not be taken for granted. T e constitutional right is meant to protect the individual from the tyranny of the majority. Not every consideration of the public interest may serve as a legitimate justif cation for limiting a human right. Rather, the public interest consideration must be suf ciently unique to justify such a limitation. T ose considerations apply, naturally, when the legislative purpose was meant to serve the public interest (such as national security).

 But what is the case when the legislative purpose is designed to advance not the public interest but rather another constitutional right? What should be the essence of the requirement for a "proper purpose" where on both sides of the scales we have constitutional rights? It seems to me that the proper answer is that whenever the purpose of a limiting legislation on one constitutional right (such as the right to privacy) is to advance another constitutional right (such as the right to enjoy good reputation), this alone should provide suf cient justif cation for the limitation of the (f rst) right. In other words, the very purpose of advancing another constitutional right, in and of itself, is a proper purpose in a constitutional democracy. T is conclusion is clearly valid in those cases where the right the legislator wishes to promote has a constitutional status. But this insight should apply to other rights at the sub-constitutional level. No other demands should be placed on such a limitation. Such recognition would express the high level of social importance placed upon the promotion of any right (here, the right to enjoy a good reputation) in a constitutional democracy.

 Of course, in the framework of proportionality stricto sensu (balancing), more weight should be given to the constitutional right than to the protection of the sub-constitutional right. T e reason for this is that protection of the constitutional right has more signif cant social importance than the protection of the sub-constitutional right. However, there is room to take into account, within the balancing, the scope of the limitation of one right and the scope of the protection of the other right. T erefore, it will at times be possible to justify a small limitation of a constitutional right to provide the sub-constitutional right with comprehensive protection.

### iv. T e duty to prevent the limitation of one right while protecting another

 Proportionality's tests (rational connection, necessity, and proportionality stricto sensu ) are all derived from the notion of a constitutional duty not to limit a constitutionally protected right (such as freedom of expression). T is duty, however, is not absolute. In some instances, a constitutional right may be limited. T e dif erent tests posed by proportionality examine these instances from dif erent angles. T ey provide public interest considerations (such as national security) with ample weight. However, they do not consider the advancement of the public interest to be a constitutional duty. National security considerations are for the executive branch to consider. An individual has no constitutional right to enjoy a higher (or lower) level of national security.

T e situation is dif erent when the limitation on the constitutional right was imposed to fulf ll the protection of another constitutional right. T e rules of proportionality not only examine the scope of the limitation placed on the limited constitutional right, but also the scope of the protection of the protected constitutional right. Take, for example, a law which limits the right to freedom of expression in order to increase the protection of a person's right to enjoy privacy. Both duties exercised by the legislator in this type of case – the duty not to limit the freedom of speech, and the duty to protect the individual's right to enjoy a good reputation – are part of the legislator's duties. T e rules of proportionality must f rst examine whether the limitation on the freedom of expression is proportional in relation to the protection provided to the right to privacy and then examine whether the protection of a good reputation is proportional in relation to the limitation imposed on the right to freedom of expression.

T ese two examinations should yield similar, or at least compatible, results. If not, the following situation may occur. A statute will be enacted limiting the right of freedom of expression in order to protect the right to privacy. T e statute will be declared constitutional. Another statute protecting the right to freedom of expression while limiting the right to privacy would also be held constitutional. Both statutes are constitutional, as the legislator acted in both of them within the zone of proportionality. 30 Closer examination of both provisions, however, would reveal that they are in conf ict. T is is an undesirable result. T e notions of constitutional harmony and coherence require a holistic examination that leads to a symmetrical result in all cases – whatever the viewpoint may be. T e sub-constitutional level at which the rules of proportionality apply should guarantee that the result is identical from every viewpoint. Another way to guarantee such harmony would be through the use of sub- constitutional rules relating to conf icts between two legislative provisions. T is solution, however, is not desired. T e solution chosen must

30 See above, at 415.

be one that achieves constitutional harmony regardless of the viewpoint taken.

T is approach should apply, naturally, when two rights at the same level of social importance and which share the same limitation clause are in conf ict. However, the application should be the same when the two rights are not at the same level of social importance and even if each has its own limitation clause. True, the specif c solution in each case may vary in accordance with the social importance of the right, as well as the wording of the specif c limitation clause in question; yet the principled approach – according to which we should aspire to achieve harmonious results and prevent, to the greatest extent possible, conf icts between the several legislative provisions appearing in dif erent laws, as well as between several provisions of the same legislative act – should apply to this type of case as well.

# **C. Te rational connection component**

T e rational connection test requires that the means selected to advance the law's purpose would be rationally connected to that same purpose. 31 It ref ects a probability test. T e degree of probability required is low. All that is required is that the contribution of the means to the fulf llment of the legislative purpose is more than minimal, and that the probability that the legislative purpose is actually achieved is not merely theoretical. 32 T is requirement is too low. T e level of probability that should be required to satisfy the rational connection test should ref ect the relative social importance of the marginal benef ts gained by achieving the law's purpose in comparison with the social importance of the marginal benef ts gained by preventing the harm caused to the constitutional right in question. But what is the proper level of probability that should be required? T is question f nds very little guidance in the comparative literature. It seems that most legal systems did not address the rational connection component. As a result, most of the interesting questions relating to probabilities have been "removed" to the later component of proportionality stricto sensu . It seems that a call for analytical development of the rational connection component is in order. What is the appropriate direction of such development?

31 See above, at 303.

- 32 See above, at 305.
 On the one hand, being satisf ed by a level of probability which is merely beyond minimal is not proper; on the other hand, it seems that the demand for a high level of probability – such as "near certainty" of the realization of the purpose should the means selected by the legislator be implemented – is also unwarranted. 33 One should not impose levels of probability that simply do not f t the social realities in a modern constitutional democracy. 34 What, then, is the proper level of probability?

 It seems that the proper development in the rational connection component should comport itself to the proposed developments in the proper purpose component. 35 In the context of the proper purpose I have suggested a hierarchy of rights that ref ects the limited right's social importance. T is hierarchy would include two levels. T e f rst would include those fundamental rights perceived by the legal system to be the most important rights. T e rest of the rights should be included in the second level. Regarding the rights at the f rst level, the suggestion is that the purpose which would justify the limitation should be compelling or pressing. As for the rights at the second level, the purpose in question should be "important."

 What is the level of probability required to fulf ll the "compelling" or "pressing" purpose (for those more important rights) and the "important" purpose (for the rest of the rights)? Regarding the "compelling" or "pressing" purpose, it is proper to demand that the probability of its fulf llment be "substantial"; as for the "important" purpose, it is proper to demand that the required probability be "reasonable." With the help of these two levels of probability, the value-laden character of this component would increase; the nature of the legislative purpose would be expressed as well as the nature of the limited right; and the burden currently placed on proportionality stricto sensu would be signif cantly diminished.

# **D. Te necessity component: future developments**

T e necessity component – or the least restrictive means component – demands that the means selected by the law to fulf ll the law's purpose be necessary. 36 T e meaning of this requirement is that there are no other means capable of fulf lling the law's purpose to the same degree and

<sup>33</sup> T e "near certainty" test is more appropriate for review in the context of proportionality stricto sensu than in the context of the rational connection test. See above, at 315. 34 See above, at 315. 35 See above, at 536. 36 See above, at 317.

whose limitation of the constitutional right is of a lesser extent. A similar component exists in the American strict scrutiny test, 37 which demands that the limiting legislation be "narrowly tailored." T e meaning of that requirement – like the necessity component – is that the law should use the less drastic or intrusive means, which is overinclusive.

 A review of the American case law on the subject reveals that this requirement is dif cult for the legislation to satisfy. 38 T is is a natural result as this test constitutes the constitutional right's very last resort: If this test is satisf ed, the limitation on the right is constitutional. T ere is no additional examination of the balancing between the harm to the right and the benef t to the public interest. In contrast to American law, however, a review of the case law of the necessity test as part of proportionality reveals a much more complex picture. In several legal systems, the necessity test serves as the main test to determine the constitutionality of the limiting legislation. 39 Other legal systems (such as France 40 ) had in the past refused to recognize the requirement at all. Still others have focused on the requirement of proportionality stricto sensu as the main tool to examine constitutionality, rendering the necessity test a less vital part of the review process. It is hard to explain such a diverse set of results. Seemingly, we could have expected a much more uniform approach. Be the explanation as it may, it seems that additional thought is required as to the more uniform application of this component in the future.

 In the framework of this reconsideration of the necessity test, it is important to preserve the test as a threshold requirement. 41 It is not a balancing test. 42T us, if the proposed alternative – which leads to less harm to the constitutional right – does not fulf ll the legislative purpose, the law is necessary. T e law is not necessary only in those cases where the proposed alternative would limit the constitutional right to a lesser extent and fulf ll the legislative purpose to the same degree as the limiting legislation. In reviewing the proposed legislative alternatives the court must apply an objective test. Indeed, in attempting to resolve the constitutional issue – either through the necessity test or through the proportionality stricto

sensu component – the judge should never step outside the boundaries of the analytical framework. Each test should be applied in accordance with its conditions. Only thus can the judicial branch create a coherent and structured approach to all of proportionality's tests.

# **E. Te proportionality stricto sensu component: future developments**

- 1. T e nature of principled balancing formulas
	- i. A principled balance as implementing the basic balancing rule

T e basic rule of balancing provides normative content to the balancing at the heart of proportionality stricto sensu . 43 It operates at the highest level of abstraction and therefore requires a concrete application on a case-bycase basis. T is application is done through specif c (or ad hoc ) balancing. 44 T e move from the highest level of abstraction to the lowest is a particularly sharp transition. T is situation is not desirable. 45 T e basic rule of balancing is too abstract. It does not specif cally relate to many of the aspects in which the particular right in question becomes a special object of either limitation or protection. It does not contain the required focus on the reasons underlying the creation of those rights, and thus does not directly relate to the reasons that justify their limitation or protection. It also does not include a proper roadmap of all the considerations that would justify the protection of a constitutional right. In contrast, the specif c rule of balancing is at too low a level of abstraction. It only relates to the case at hand, and lacks a more general viewpoint of the system as a whole.

 With this in mind, the question arises whether there is room for a third rule of balancing. T is rule would be located between the basic balancing rule (which is the most abstract) and the specif c balancing (which is the most concrete). T is intermediate-level rule would present a principled balancing, in a way that would implement or apply the basic rule of balancing into several principled rules or principled formulas of balancing. As such, those formulas would be phrased in a lower level of abstraction than the basic rule of balancing, but at a higher level of abstraction than the

specif c rule of balancing. 46 T is intermediate level of abstraction would express the principled consideration which underlies the constitutional right and the justif cation of its limitation. What should the nature of this intermediate level be? How similar should it be to specif c balancing? What are its justif cations? I turn to these questions now.

## ii. T e structure of the principled balancing formula

T e principled balancing formula must, f rst and foremost, fulf ll the basic balancing rule. T at basic rule of balancing compares the marginal social importance of the benef t gained by the limiting law and the marginal social importance of preventing the harm to the constitutional right. T e principled balancing formula would translate this abstract notion into a formula comparing the marginal social importance of the specif c limited right on the one end and the marginal social importance of the specif c legislative purpose on the other. It would determine the conditions that the limiting law must satisfy for the limitation to be proportional stricto sensu . T e principled formula will ref ect the main normative considerations that justify marginal harm to the constitutional right in question in order to gain the marginal benef ts for another right, or for the public interest as a whole. One end of the scales consists of considerations relating to the marginal social importance of the right, to the scope of the suggested limitation, and to the probability that such a limitation would actually occur. T e other end of the scales – that of the legislative purpose – would ref ect considerations relating to the marginal social importance of the purpose as interpreted against the background of its content and the degree of urgency in its realization, the probability of its realization and the harm that would be incurred should the purpose not be realized, and the probability of the occurrence of such damage. 47

 Take, for example, a statute limiting the right to political speech. T is right is of a fundamental nature. Assume that the reason for the limitation is the protection of the public from racist political speech. T e principled balancing formula that applies to a conf ict between the right to freedom of political speech and the right to be protected from the ef ects of racist speech may determine that a limitation of the right in these circumstances would be justif ed only in those instances where the purpose of protecting

Balancing," 4 Law and Ethics of Hum. Rts . 1 (2010). 47 On probability tests in American law, see J. S. Masur, "Probability T resholds," 92 Iowa L. Rev . 1293 ( 2007 ).

the public from the ef ects of such speech is "pressing" or "compelling" in order to prevent imminent and severe harm to public order. T is example demonstrates how the principled balancing formula operates at a lower level of abstraction than that of the basic rule of balancing, yet one that is still higher than specif c balancing. It operates at that level of abstraction which expresses the reasons underlying the creation of the right itself, the justif cations for its limitation, and the reasons for its protection.

 Principled balancing formulas and specif c balancing should exist concomitantly. One is not intended to replace the other. 48 Specif c balancing fulf lls the principled balancing formulas according to the circumstances of each specif c case. It implements the principled balancing formulas – which, in turn, are based on the basic balancing rule – on a case-by-case basis. T e principled balancing formulas "ref ect a general legal norm, which sets a constitutional principle that applies on a set of similar circumstances." T e notion of basic balancing may apply in this way to every situation where a constitutional right has been limited.

T ere are many constitutional rights, each with their own aspects. T ere are many considerations of the public interest, each with its own aspects. Principled balancing formulas must ref ect this diversity. 49 Several principled balancing formulas should be established, therefore, in order to guarantee said ref ection. T us, for example, principled balancing formulas relating to political speech should not be the same as those relating to commercial speech; formulas relating to prior restraint should not be identical to those relating to ex post facto restrictions; those relating to minimal infringements should be markedly dif erent from those relating to substantial limitations; a law whose purpose is the protection of life dif ers from a law whose purpose is preserving one's privacy.

T e number of principled balancing formulas relating to constitutional rights is much higher than the number of constitutional rights. Each constitutional right may be accompanied by a number of principled balancing formulas that ref ect its social importance, the scope of the harm it would suf er should the purpose of the limiting law be achieved, and the probability that such a limitation would occur. In addition, the balancing formula ref ects the social importance of the law's purpose, the degree of its urgency, the harm that may be caused to another right (either of the individual that is harmed, or of another person) or to the public interest

<sup>48</sup> See S. Gardbaum, "Limiting Constitutional Rights," 54 UCLA L. Rev . 789, 804 ( 2007 ). 49 See HCJ 153/83 Levy v. Southern District Commissioner of Police [1984] IsrSC 38(2) 393, 400 ("T e diversity of circumstances requires a diversity of balancing points. T ere should not be a single standard by which all problems should be evaluated.").

should the law's purpose not be advanced, the probability that such harm would be caused to the public interest under those circumstances, and f nally the probability of gaining the benef ts intended by the limiting law should the limitation be imposed on the constitutional right at issue.

### 2. Principled balancing formulas: a comparative survey

# i. T e lack of principled balancing formulas

 A review of the comparative constitutional law on the issue of principled balancing formulas leads to the conclusion that, other than American and Israeli law, 50 very little attention has been paid by most legal systems to the development of principled balancing formulas. What might be the reason for this lack of interest? It is possible that it stems from the prevailing notion – across many a legal system – that all constitutional rights – the rights limited and the rights protected – are of equal social importance.51 According to this notion, when a constitutional right is limited in order to protect another constitutional right, all that needs to be examined is the type of limitation imposed on the right – a light, moderate, or serious 52 limitation; and, according to the answer to this question, to examine the importance of advancing the law's purpose. T us, the identical importance of the limited rights and the right protected has prevented the abstraction of the notion of balancing beyond the concrete cases. T e social value of the fulf llment of the legislative purpose is always considered, but it seems that those legal systems found it dif cult to recognize principled balancing formulas whenever one end of the scales – the end pertaining to the right's limitation – cannot "rise" above the level of the circumstances of the specif c case. Indeed, Alexy emphasizes that all the balancing process examines is which of the conf icting principles – all having equal stature in theory – has more weight in the specif c case at hand:

> [A]bstract weights only have an inf uence on the outcome of balancing if they [the principles] are dif erent. If they are equal, which in the case of competing constitutional rights is of en the case, the only relevant factor is their concrete importance. 53

<sup>50</sup> See A. Barak, T e Judge in a Democracy (Princeton University Press, 2006 ), 170; A. Barak,

<sup>&</sup>quot;Human Rights in Israel," 39 Isr. L. Rev . 12 ( 2006 ). 51 See S. Greer, T e European Convention on Human Rights: Achievements, Problems and

Prospects (Cambridge University Press, 2006 ), 218. 52 See R. Alexy, A T eory of Constitutional Rights (Julian Rivers trans., Oxford University Press, 2002 [1986]). 53 Ibid ., at 406.

T e same reasoning may also explain the German approach, according to which whenever two constitutional rights are in conf ict – assuming they are equal in their social importance – they should be balanced only through " praktische Konkordanz ." 54

T is explanation, however, is not satisfactory. 55 T is is for two reasons. First, several legal systems have developed an approach according to which not all rights are equal in social importance. 56 Accordingly, a principled standard is required to determine the balancing between these rights. Second, even if all constitutional rights are of equal social importance, there is still room for principled balancing formulas for those cases where the (equal) rights conf ict with the public interest. Principled balancing – as derived from the basic rule of balancing – is the correct approach to be adopted. Is that the reason it has been adopted by the American legal system? T is question will now be examined.

- ii. Principled balancing in American constitutional law
T e role of principled balancing within American constitutional law is dif erent from the suggested role of principled balancing formulas within proportionality stricto sensu . In American law, principled balancing is used as an interpretive standard to determine the scope of the constitutional right. 57 For example, the US Supreme Court has ruled that the First Amendment right to freedom of expression does not apply to several depictions of racist hate speech or obscenities. 58 Such an interpretive conclusion is the result of interpretive balancing 59 whose purpose is to determine the boundaries of freedom of expression as a constitutional right. T e Supreme Court thus considered the purposes underlying the right to freedom of expression, balanced between them, and ruled that the right should not protect racist hate speech and obscenities. T at is the reason that this kind of balancing is dubbed " def nitional balancing," as it def nes

the scope of the right. 60 Once the right's boundaries have been def ned, there is no longer a need for this interpretive (or def nitional) balancing. Similarly, no additional balancing is required or conducted within those well-def ned boundaries. T us, for example, the strict scrutiny review 61 – which applies to all political speech – examines whether the limitation was meant to serve a compelling or pressing governmental interest, and whether the legislative means have been narrowly tailored to achieve such a purpose. None of those requirements demands a balancing. 62 T us, a "proportionality leaning" scholar or judge should be extremely cautious in relying on American jurisprudence on this issue as useful comparative material. One should always remember that, in the United States, once the right has been narrowed (or redef ned) according to the interpretive balancing which has been conducted, it is no longer the subject of additional balancing. Further, a legal system applying proportionality should be extremely careful when using the American precedents on the subject for the following reason: if such a system were to adopt the American approach of initially narrowing the right's scope through the use of interpretive balancing, it would still need to continue and reduce the extent to which the right is protected through the use of principled balancing as required by both proportionality in general and proportionality stricto sensu in particular. T us, by relying on the American approach, the constitutional right at issue may well be af ected twice: f rst, through the narrowing of its scope (by using the American interpretive balancing), and, second, by reducing the extent to which the right is protected (by using proportionality's principled balancing as developed by Israeli law).

Having identified proportionality as the main tool for limiting constitutional rights, Aharon Barak explores its four components (proper purpose, rational connection, necessity and proportionality stricto sensu) and discusses the relationships between proportionality and reasonableness and between courts and legislation. He goes on to analyse the concept of deference and to consider the main arguments against the use of proportionality (incommensurability and irrationality). Alternatives to proportionality are compared and future developments of proportionality are suggested. Frontmatter:
